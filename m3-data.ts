Base your answers to questions 26 through 28 on the passage below and on your knowledge of social studies.\

 . . . Climate change is not equally felt across the globe, and neither are its longer term consequences. . . . Climate change is a threat multiplier: It contributes to economic and political instability and also worsens the effects. It propels sudden onset disasters like floods and storms and slow-onset disasters like drought and desertification; those disasters contribute to failed crops, famine and overcrowded urban centers; those crises inflame political unrest and worsen the impacts of war, which leads to even more displacement. There is no internationally recognized legal definition for “environmental migrants” or “climate refugees,” so there is no formal reckoning of how many have left their homes because climate change has made their lives or livelihoods untenable [unsustainable]. In a 2010 Gallup World Poll, though, about 12 percent of respondents — representing a total of 500 million adults — said severe environmental problems would require them to move within the next five years. . . .\

An experiment is described below.\
 A large field at the base of a mountain becomes flooded when heavy rains in the mountains cause a stream to overflow. Each time the flooding occurs, more soil washes away.\
 The owners of the land want to perform an experiment to see if different types of plants could help reduce the soil erosion. They choose five areas of ground that are the same size, the same distance from the stream, have the same slope and the same kind of soil, and receive the same amount of sunlight. The type of plant planted in each area is different for each of the five areas. Measurements of soil erosion will be made each time flooding occurs. The results will be compared after six months.\
 \
 Which hypothesis is being tested in this experiment?\
(1) Soil erosion is affected by the strength of the wind.\
 (2) Flooded areas have greater soil erosion than areas that are not flooded.\
 (3) Some types of plants reduce soil erosion more than others.\
 (4) Some types of soil are more easily eroded.\

Excerpt from A la Carte\
 \
 by Tanita S. Davis\
 \
 (paragraph 1) “Homework?” My mother mouths the word exaggeratedly, eyebrows raised, and I roll my eyes. Frowning, she points with her chin to the side door that leads to the stairs. I roll my eyes again, mouthing, Okay, okay, not needing her to pantomime further what she wants me to do. I hate the thought of leaving the clattering nerve center of the restaurant to wrestle with my trigonometry homework in my mother’s quiet office downstairs.\
 \
 (paragraph 2) “Order!”\
 \
 (paragraph 3) The bright lights and swirl of noise and motion are muffled as the kitchen door swings closed behind me.\
 \
 (paragraph 4) It’s hard to remember a time when the restaurant hasn’t been the center of our lives. Mom used to be a copy editor and wrote food features for our local paper, the Clarion, and she met Pia when she did a write-up on the culinary school Pia attended. Pia thinks it was fate that Mom wanted to invest in a restaurant at the same time Pia wanted to buy the old bank building.\
 \
 (paragraph 5) La Salle Rouge doesn’t serve much in the way of “kid” food, since the menu doesn’t cater to people my age on a cheap date, but I’ve loved everything about it from the first. I started experimenting with being a vegetarian when I turned fourteen, but Pia still found things to feed me and taught me to be creative with vegetables and tofu. I like to think I’m the best-fed vegetarian in the state of California.\
 \
 (paragraph 6) Pia’s been really good about teaching what she knows, and I decided early on that this is the work I want to do—get out of school and get into the kitchen for good. Mom and Pia have created a popular French-Asian-Californian fusion restaurant that has gotten great reviews from food critics. They took the best of each other’s tastes—Mom’s traditional Southern flavors and Pia’s French training combined with her vegetable- and spice-savvy Cambodian tastes—and pulled off what one food critic called “stylized food with unique flavor combinations in an intimate setting.”\
 \
 (paragraph 7) Whatever that means.\
 \
 (paragraph 8) Three years ago, when I started high school thirty pounds heavier than everyone in my class, Mom and I came up with a light menu for La Salle Rouge, and it’s been such a popular idea that Mom lets me come up with tasty, low-calorie desserts, which is one of my favorite things to do. It hardly seems fair that I have to walk away from all of that just to do trigonometry, but my mom says I have to finish school before I concentrate on cooking. She says it’s smarter to have a “backup plan,” and she’s made me apply to plenty of colleges and check out business majors just in case I ever want to do anything else with my life. I guess that makes sense if you’re anybody other than me. When I turn eighteen, I already know what I’m going to do.\
 \
 (paragraph 9) First, I’m going to buy a plane ticket to D.C. and go to Julia Child’s kitchen at the Smithsonian and leave roses. They don’t let you walk through it, but somewhere—I don’t know where—I’m going to leave a bouquet and a little note for her. Julia Child is my patron saint. (patron saint - an inspiring person admired for his or her work) She’s the queen of all reasons people can do anything they want in life. Saint Julia didn’t start cooking until she was practically forty, and she went on to do TV shows and make cookbooks and be this huge part of culinary history. She never got too fancy, she never freaked out, and she was never afraid to try new things. I want to be just like her—except maybe get famous faster.\
 \
 (paragraph 10) The second thing I’m going to do is buy myself a set of knives. Pia swears by this set of German steel knives she got when she graduated, but I’ve seen the TV chef Kylie Kwong use a phenomenal-looking ceramic knife on her show on the Discovery Channel. Either way, knives are what the best chefs have of their very own.\
 \
 (paragraph 11) The third thing I’m going to do, after I get back from Washington and get my knives, is . . . get discovered. Somehow. I know I’m going to have to pay my dues, but I’m so ready for my real life to start. It’s not something I admit to a lot, but my real dream is to be a celebrity chef. Do you know how many African American female chefs there aren’t? And how many vegetarian chefs have their own shows? The field is wide open for stardom. Every time I watch old episodes of Saint Julia, I imagine that I have my own cooking show. The way celebrity chefs do it now, I could also have a line of cooking gear, cookbooks, aprons, the works. People would know my name, ask for my autograph, and try my recipes. All I have to do is finish my trig homework and get back into the kitchen.\
Which sentence would be most important to include in a summary of the story?\
(A) When the narrator’s mother makes her do homework, the narrator rolls her eyes.\
 (B) When the narrator’s mother wanted to invest in a restaurant, Pia wanted to buy the old bank building.\
 (C) The narrator admires celebrity chefs.\
 (D) The narrator lives in California.\

 Mrs. Majeska and the Lost Gloves\
 \
 by Ethel Pochocki\
 \
 (paragraph 1) One crisp fall morning, Mrs. Majeska woke up with a craving for sauerkraut. It was so strong, she could smell it, she could taste it, and she knew she must have it for supper. So she put on her walking shoes, picked up her tub with a lid and a handle, and went into town to buy some.\
 \
 sauerkraut = chopped, pickled cabbage\
 \
  (paragraph 2) She walked briskly, enjoying the wind messing up her hair and the parade of dried leaves dancing ahead of her. It was a glorious day, and the thought of sauerkraut for supper, with a bit of apple and onion and sausage, made her want to dance along with the leaves.\
 \
 (paragraph 3) But suddenly she stopped. In the road there was a glove, a small black glove, the ﬁngers still plump, as if it had just left its owner’s hand. It was out of place in the middle of the road.\
 \
 (paragraph 4) Poor thing, thought Mrs. Majeska. I cannot leave it there. She picked it up quickly— a logging truck was coming—and laid it on the grass. She felt sorry for its owner, who now had only one glove. What good was one glove?\
 \
 (paragraph 5) On the way home from the store, she walked on the other side of the road, the sauerkraut sloshing inside the tub. A cluster of children came toward her, laughing and shouting to one another as they took turns kicking something in the dust. Finally they tired of it and ran off past Mrs. Majeska.\
 \
 (paragraph 6) She looked down at the sorry thing they had been kicking. It was another black glove, of the same size and shape as the one she had rescued. She examined it—yes, it was the mate to the other!\
 \
 (paragraph 7) Mrs. Majeska hesitated, then continued walking. It was only a glove, after all, not a child or a kitten or a wallet. Suddenly she stopped, turned around, and walked back to the crumpled bit of cloth. She picked it up, shook it out, and brushed off the dirt. It looked almost as good as new.\
 \
 (paragraph 8) With the glove in one hand and the tub of sauerkraut in the other, she strode down the road to where the other glove still lay in the grass. She placed its mate beside it, satisﬁed that they were now together. For what good was one glove without the other?\
 \
 (paragraph 9) A boy whizzed by on a bike and looked at her. Two old ladies, arm in arm, marched toward her on their way to the post ofﬁce. Mrs. Maj eska bent down and pretended to tie her Shoelaces, for she felt foolish to be caught in the act of reuniting a pair of gloves.\
 \
 (paragraph 10) That night, after a supper as delicious as she had imagined it, Mrs. Majeska sat in her rocker and thought about the gloves. She wished she had brought them home to use for herself. Their owner had probably already given them up for lost. The next morning,\
 after she had her coffee and read the newspaper, she decided to go back and get the gloves. But they were gone.\
 \
 (paragraph 11) Mrs. Majeska was mystiﬁed. Who—beside herself—would want a pair of gloves lying by the side of the road? Perhaps the owner had retraced her steps and rejoiced in ﬁnding them? Or maybe a housewife on a cleaning binge had used them to polish the stove? Or maybe a puppy needed something to chew on? Or a squirrel, to line its nest for winter?\
 \
 (paragraph 12) Mrs. Majeska would never know, but as long as she did not know, she would believe in a happy ending. No matter what their fate, the gloves were together, and that was all that mattered.\
Which word best describes Mrs. Majeska in paragraph 10?\
(A) proud\
 (B) restless\
 (C) stubborn\
 (D) regretful\

 Reading Comprehension Passage A\
 \
 Caramelo\
 \
    One would think now that she was living in Chicago, in the same city as her [favorite son] \
 Inocencio, the Grandmother would find happiness. But no, that wasn’t the case. The \
 Grandmother was meaner than ever. She was unhappy. And didn’t know she was unhappy, \
 the worst kind of unhappiness of all. As a result, everyone was in a hurry to find her a house\
 (line 5) of some sort. A bungalow, a duplex, a brownstone, an apartment. Something, anything, \
 because the Grandmother’s gloominess was the contagious kind, infecting every member of \
 the household as fiercely as the bubonic plague. \
    Because Baby [Inocencio’s brother] and Ninfa’s apartment had room to accommodate \
 a guest, it was understood the Grandmother would stay with them until she could find a \
 (line 10) house of her own. This had seemed all well and fine when the plans were made long-\
 distance with Uncle Baby shouting into the receiver that he insisted, that he and Ninfa \
 wouldn’t think of her staying anywhere else, that the girls were thrilled she was coming. But \
 now that she was actually sleeping in [granddaughter] Amor’s narrow bed with radios and \
 televisions chattering throughout the apartment, and doors and cupboards banging, and the \
 (line 15) stink of cigarettes soaking into everything, even her skin, and trucks rumbling past and \
 shaking the building like an earthquake, and sirens and car horns at all hours, well, it just \
 about drove her crazy; even the rowdy Chicago wind, a rough, moody brute who took one \
 look at you and laughed. …\
    All day and all night the expressway traffic whooshed past, keeping the Grandmother\
 (line 20) awake. She napped when she could, even when the apartment and its inhabitants jabbered \
 the loudest. She was tired all the time, and yet she had trouble sleeping, often waking once \
 or twice in the early morning, and in her sleeplessness, padding in her house slippers to the \
 living room, where the front windows looked out onto the lanes of traffic, the expressway \
 billboards, and the frighteningly grimy factories beyond. The trucks and cars, furious to get\
 (line 25) from here to there, never paused for a moment, the sound of the expressway almost not a \
 sound at all, but a roar like the voice of the sea trapped inside a shell. \
    She pressed her forehead against the cold glass and sighed. If the Grandmother had \
 consulted her feelings, she would’ve understood why it was taking her so long to buy a new \
 house and settle in Chicago, but she was not a woman given to reflection. She missed her\
 (line 30) old house too much and was too proud to admit she’d made a mistake. She couldn’t go \
 backward, could she? She was stuck, in the middle of nowhere it seemed, halfway between \
 here and where? \
    The Grandmother missed the routine of her mornings, her three-minute eggs and \
 bolillo (bolillo - crunchy roll) breakfasts. She missed rubbing her big toe along the octagon tiles of her bathroom \
 (line 35) floor. But most of all, she missed her own bed with its mattress sagging in the center, the \
 familiar scent and weight of her blankets, the way morning entered gradually from the left\
 as the sun climbed over the east courtyard wall, the one topped with a cockscomb (cockscomb -rooster’s crown with jagged edges) of glass \
 shards to keep out the thieves. Why do we get so used to waking up in a certain room? And \
 when we aren’t in our own bed and wake up in another, a terrible fear for a moment, like\
 (line 40) death.\
    There is nothing worse than being a houseguest for too long, especially when your host\
 is a relative. The Grandmother felt like a prisoner. She hated climbing up the three flights\
 of stairs, and always arrived clutching her heart, convinced she was having an attack, like\
 the one that killed Narciso [her husband]. Really, once she was upstairs, she couldn’t even\
 (line 45) bear the thought of coming back down. What a barbarity! …\
    To visit Chicago is one thing, to live there another. This was not the Chicago of her\
 vacations, where one is always escorted to the lake shore, to the gold coast, driven along the\
 winding lanes of traffic of Lake Shore Drive in the shadow of beautiful apartment buildings,\
 along State Street and Michigan Avenue to window-shop at least. And perhaps taken on an\
 (line 50) excursion on the lake. How is it she hadn’t noticed the expression of the citizens, not the\
 ones fluttering in and out of taxis, but the ones at bus stops, hopping like sparrows, shivering\
 and peering anxiously for the next bus, and those descending wearily into the filthy bowels\
 of the subway like the souls condemned to purgatory.(purgatory - place of suffering)\
    At first the Grandmother was thrilled by the restaurants and the big discount chains—\
 (line 55) but then the routine got to be too familiar. Saturdays in search of houses that were not to\
 her liking. Dark brick houses with small, squinty windows, gloomy apartments, or damp\
 little bungalows, everything somber and sad and not letting in enough light, and no\
 courtyards, a dank, (dank - damp) mean gangway, a small patch of thin grass called a garden, and maybe a\
 bald tree in front. This wasn’t what she had in mind.\
 (line 60)   And as the weeks and months passed, and she was still without a house, the rainy, cold\
 autumn weather began and only made her feel worse. There was the Chicago winter\
 coming that everyone had warned her about, and she was already so cold and miserable she\
 didn’t feel much like leaving her room, let alone the building. She blamed Ninfa, who kept\
 lowering the heat in order to save money. The Grandmother confined herself to bed,\
 (line 65) satisfied only when she was under several layers of blankets. …\
    But nothing, nothing in the Grandmother’s imagination prepared her for the horrors of\
 a Chicago winter. It was not the picturesque (picturesque - charming) season of Christmas, but the endless tundra\
 of January, February, and March. Daylight dimmed to a dull pewter. (pewter - gray) The sun a thick piece\
 of ice behind a dirty woolen sky. It was a cold like you can’t imagine, a barbarous thing, a\
 (line 70) knife in the bone, a cold so cold it burned the lungs if one could even believe such a cold.\
 And the mountains of filthy snow shoveled in huge heaps, the chunks of ice on the sidewalk\
 that could kill an aged citizen. —Oh, this is nothing, you should’ve been here for the Big\
 Snow, the grandchildren bragged, speaking of the recent storm of ’68.\
    Big snow or little snow, it was all the same after the novelty of snow had worn off. A\
 (line 75) nuisance, a deadly thing, an exaggerated, long, drawn-out ordeal that made one feel like\
 dying, that killed one slowly, a torture. Let me die in February, let me die rather than have\
 to step out the door again, please, the Grandmother thought to herself, dreading having to\
 dress like a monster to go outside. —Ay, ya no puedo. I can’t anymore, I can’t. And just\
 when she could no longer, when she could no longer find the strength, the drive, the will to\
 (line 80) keep on living, when she was ready to fold into herself and let her spirit die, just then, and\
 only then, did April arrive with sky the color of hope and branches filled with possibilities.\

This is the true story of a Kenyan woman named Wangari Maathai.\
 \
 Excerpt from Seeds of Change:\
 Planting a Path to Peace\
 \
 by Jen Cullerton Johnson\
 \
 (paragraph 1) “Come,” Wangari’s mother called. She beckoned her young daughter over to a tall tree with a wide, smooth trunk and a crown of green, oval leaves.\
 \
 (paragraph 2) “Feel,” her mother whispered.\
 \
 (paragraph 3) Wangari spread her small hands over the tree’s trunk. She smoothed her fingers over the rough bark.\
 \
 (paragraph 4) “This is the mugumo,” her mother said. “It is home to many. It feeds many too.”\
 \
 (paragraph 5) She snapped off a wild fig from a low branch, and gave it to her daughter. Wangari ate the delicious fruit, just as geckos and elephants did. High in the tree, birds chirped in their nests. The branches bounced with jumping monkeys.\
 \
 (paragraph 6) “Our people, the Kikuyu of Kenya, believe that our ancestors rest in the tree’s shade,” her mother explained.\
 \
 (paragraph 7) Wangari wrapped her arms around the trunk as if hugging her great-grandmother’s spirit. She promised never to cut down the tree. . . .\
 \
 ((paragraph 8) When Wangari finished elementary school, she was eleven years old. Her mind was like a seed rooted in rich soil, ready to grow. Wangari wanted to continue her education, but to do so she would have to leave her village and move to the capital city of Nairobi. Wangari had never been farther than her valley’s ridge. She was scared.\
 \
 (paragraph 9) “Go,” her mother said. She picked up a handful of earth and placed it gently into her daughter’s hand. “Where you go, we go.” . . .\
 \
 (paragraph 10) As graduation neared, Wangari told her friends she wanted to become a biologist.\
 \
 (paragraph 11) “Not many native women become biologists,” they told her.\
 \
 (paragraph 12) “I will,” she said.\
 \
 (paragraph 13) Wangari watched sadly as her government sold more and more land to big companies that cut down forests for timber and to clear land for coffee plantations. Native trees such as cedar and acacia vanished. Without trees, birds had no place to nest. Monkeys lost their swings. Tired mothers walked miles for firewood. . . .\
 \
 (paragraph 14) When Wangari visited her village she saw that the Kikuyu custom of not chopping down the mugumo trees had been lost. No longer held in place by tree roots, the soil streamed into the rivers. The water that had been used to grow maize, bananas, and sweet potatoes turned to mud and dried up. Many families went hungry.\
 \
 (paragraph 15) Wangari could not bear to think of the land being destroyed. Now married and the mother of three children, she worried about what would happen to the mothers and children who depended on the land.\
 \
 (paragraph 16) “We must do something,” Wangari said.\
 \
 (paragraph 17) Wangari had an idea as small as a seed but as tall as a tree that reaches for the sky. “Harabee! Let’s work together!” she said to her countrywomen—mothers like her. Wangari dug deep into the soil, a seedling by her side. “We must plant trees.” . . .\
 \
 (paragraph 18) Wangari traveled to villages, towns, and cities with saplings and seeds, shovels and hoes. At each place she went, women planted rows of trees that looked like green belts across the land. Because of this they started calling themselves the Green Belt Movement.\
 \
 (paragraph 19) “We might not change the big world but we can change the landscape of the forest,” she said.\
 \
 (paragraph 20) One tree turned to ten, ten to one hundred, one hundred to one million, all the way up to thirty million planted trees. Kenya grew green again. Birds nested in new trees. Monkeys swung on branches. Rivers filled with clean water. Wild figs grew heavy in mugumo branches.\
 \
 (paragraph 21) Mothers fed their children maize, bananas, and sweet potatoes until they could eat no more.\
How does the title of the article support a main idea?\
(A) It describes advice Wangari followed.\
 (B) It describes how Wangari solved a problem.\
 (C) It explains how Wangari felt about trees.\
 (D) It explains which values Wangari’s village held.\

Excerpt from One-Eyed Cat\
 by Paula Fox\
 \
 Ned loved snow, the whisper when he walked through it, a sound like candles being\
 blown out, the coming indoors out of it into the warmth, and standing on the register in\
 the big hall through which the dusty, metal-smelling heat blew up, and the going back out\
 again, shivering, cold, stooping and scooping up a handful to make a snowball, packing it\
 (line 5) hard with wet mittens, hefting it, tossing it as far as he could, and the runners of his sled\
 whispering across it as he sleighed down the slopes which were smooth and glittering and\
 hard, like great jewels.\
 On the first of December, there was a heavy snowfall. When Ned looked out of his\
 window the next morning, the river glowed like a snake made out of light as it wound\
 (line 10) among the snow-covered mountains.\
 He ate breakfast hastily, too preoccupied to read the story on the cereal box.\
 Mrs. Scallop (Mrs. Scallop: Ned’s family’s housekeeper) was broody this morning and left him a lone, her glance passing over him as\
 it passed over the kitchen chairs.\
 On the porch, he paused to take deep breaths of air which tasted, he imagined, like\
 (line 15) water from the center of the ocean, then he waded into the snow, passing the Packard (Packard: a brand of car that is no longer manufactured), its\
 windows white and hidden, the crabapple tree with its weighted branches, down the long\
 hill trying to guess if he was anywhere near the buried driveway. By the time he reached\
 Mr. Scully’s house, his galoshes were topped with snow and his feet were wet. Mr. Scully’s\
 shades were drawn; the house had a pinched look as though it felt the cold.\
 (line 20) Ned went around to the back until he could see the shed. There were boot tracks in\
 the snow leading to it and returning to the back door. He guessed the old man had taken\
 in the cat’s bowl; it was nowhere to be seen. You couldn’t leave anything out in this\
 weather, it would freeze. Mr. Scully had told him that finding water in the winter was a\
 big problem for animals. Licking the snow or ice could make them sick.\
 (line 25) Ned stared hard at the shed. Perhaps the cat was inside, squeezed in behind logs in a\
 tight space where its own breath would keep it warm. He was going to be late to school if\
 he didn’t get a move on, but he kept looking hard all over the yard as though he could\
 make the cat appear out of snow and gray sky. Twice, his glance passed over the icebox.\
 The third time, he saw that the motionless mound on top of it was not only the quilt but\
 (line 30) the cat, joined into one shape by a dusting of snow.\
 Ned held his breath for a moment, then put his own feet in Mr. Scully’s tracks and\
 went toward the shed. The tracks had frozen and they crunched under Ned’s weight, but\
 the cat didn’t raise its head. Ned halted a few feet away from it—but of course, he realized,\
 it wouldn’t hear him because of its deaf ear. He could have gone closer to it than he’d ever\
 (line 35) been but he had a sudden vision of the cat exploding into fear when it finally did\
 hear him.\
 When he got back to the front of the house, he saw fresh footsteps on the road. He\
 could tell it was the road because of the deep ditches which fell away to either side. He\
 guessed they were Billy’s tracks. It was odd to think that Billy, huffing and puffing, had\
 (line 40) gone past Mr. Scully’s place, thinking his own thoughts, while he, Ned, only a few yards\
 away, had been searching for the cat. He found Evelyn’s tracks, too, and later on, Janet’s,\
 the smallest of all. He felt ghostly as if he’d been left alone on a white, silent globe.\
 Somewhere in the evergreen woods, snow must have slid off a bough, for he heard the\
 loud plop, then the fainter sound of the bough springing up, relieved of the weight. He\
 (line 45) thought about the cat, visualizing how it had looked on the quilt. How still it had been!\
 Why hadn’t he gone right up to it, looked at it close, touched its fur? Why had it been so\
 motionless—still as death, still as a dead vole he’d seen last summer in the grass near the\
 well? He came to the snow-covered blacktop road upon which a few cars had left their\
 ridged tire tracks. He had a strong impulse to turn back, to play hooky for the first time in\
 (line 50) his life. Mr. Scully, with his poor eyesight, might not spot the cat on top of the icebox,\
 might not, then, set food out for it. Fretting and shivering, his feet numb, Ned went on\
 to school.\
 He tried very hard to concentrate on his lessons, to watch Miss Jefferson’s plump, even\
 handwriting on the blackboard as she wrote out the lines from a poem by Thomas Gray\
 (line 55) that the class was to memorize that week, but try as he might, the image of the unmoving\
 animal on the ragged old quilt persisted. Last week, on a rainy afternoon, the cat had\
 looked at Ned, had cocked its head as though to see him better. Its one eye, narrowed, had\
 reminded him of a grain of wheat.\
 “The curfew tolls the knell of parting day,\
 (line 60) The lowing herd wind slowly o’er the lea . . .”\
 Ned read the lines several times before copying them down in his copybook. The\
 words made no sense to him. It was this that had made his hours in school so hard ever\
 since he and Mr. Scully had seen the cat last autumn, this drawing away of his attention\
 from everything that was going on around him. He was either relieved because the cat was\
 (line 65) where he could see it or fearful because he didn’t know where it was.\
In lines 31 through 36, Ned keeps his distance from the cat because he\
(A) envisions the cat being sick from licking ice or snow\
 (B) believes the cat will make him late to school\
 (C) imagines the cat will become panicked\
 (D) remembers the cat is deaf and unlikely to respond\

 Reading Comprehension Passage A\
 \
 Caramelo\
 \
    One would think now that she was living in Chicago, in the same city as her [favorite son] \
 Inocencio, the Grandmother would find happiness. But no, that wasn’t the case. The \
 Grandmother was meaner than ever. She was unhappy. And didn’t know she was unhappy, \
 the worst kind of unhappiness of all. As a result, everyone was in a hurry to find her a house\
 (line 5) of some sort. A bungalow, a duplex, a brownstone, an apartment. Something, anything, \
 because the Grandmother’s gloominess was the contagious kind, infecting every member of \
 the household as fiercely as the bubonic plague. \
    Because Baby [Inocencio’s brother] and Ninfa’s apartment had room to accommodate \
 a guest, it was understood the Grandmother would stay with them until she could find a \
 (line 10) house of her own. This had seemed all well and fine when the plans were made long-\
 distance with Uncle Baby shouting into the receiver that he insisted, that he and Ninfa \
 wouldn’t think of her staying anywhere else, that the girls were thrilled she was coming. But \
 now that she was actually sleeping in [granddaughter] Amor’s narrow bed with radios and \
 televisions chattering throughout the apartment, and doors and cupboards banging, and the \
 (line 15) stink of cigarettes soaking into everything, even her skin, and trucks rumbling past and \
 shaking the building like an earthquake, and sirens and car horns at all hours, well, it just \
 about drove her crazy; even the rowdy Chicago wind, a rough, moody brute who took one \
 look at you and laughed. …\
    All day and all night the expressway traffic whooshed past, keeping the Grandmother\
 (line 20) awake. She napped when she could, even when the apartment and its inhabitants jabbered \
 the loudest. She was tired all the time, and yet she had trouble sleeping, often waking once \
 or twice in the early morning, and in her sleeplessness, padding in her house slippers to the \
 living room, where the front windows looked out onto the lanes of traffic, the expressway \
 billboards, and the frighteningly grimy factories beyond. The trucks and cars, furious to get\
 (line 25) from here to there, never paused for a moment, the sound of the expressway almost not a \
 sound at all, but a roar like the voice of the sea trapped inside a shell. \
    She pressed her forehead against the cold glass and sighed. If the Grandmother had \
 consulted her feelings, she would’ve understood why it was taking her so long to buy a new \
 house and settle in Chicago, but she was not a woman given to reflection. She missed her\
 (line 30) old house too much and was too proud to admit she’d made a mistake. She couldn’t go \
 backward, could she? She was stuck, in the middle of nowhere it seemed, halfway between \
 here and where? \
    The Grandmother missed the routine of her mornings, her three-minute eggs and \
 bolillo (bolillo - crunchy roll) breakfasts. She missed rubbing her big toe along the octagon tiles of her bathroom \
 (line 35) floor. But most of all, she missed her own bed with its mattress sagging in the center, the \
 familiar scent and weight of her blankets, the way morning entered gradually from the left\
 as the sun climbed over the east courtyard wall, the one topped with a cockscomb (cockscomb -rooster’s crown with jagged edges) of glass \
 shards to keep out the thieves. Why do we get so used to waking up in a certain room? And \
 when we aren’t in our own bed and wake up in another, a terrible fear for a moment, like\
 (line 40) death.\
    There is nothing worse than being a houseguest for too long, especially when your host\
 is a relative. The Grandmother felt like a prisoner. She hated climbing up the three flights\
 of stairs, and always arrived clutching her heart, convinced she was having an attack, like\
 the one that killed Narciso [her husband]. Really, once she was upstairs, she couldn’t even\
 (line 45) bear the thought of coming back down. What a barbarity! …\
    To visit Chicago is one thing, to live there another. This was not the Chicago of her\
 vacations, where one is always escorted to the lake shore, to the gold coast, driven along the\
 winding lanes of traffic of Lake Shore Drive in the shadow of beautiful apartment buildings,\
 along State Street and Michigan Avenue to window-shop at least. And perhaps taken on an\
 (line 50) excursion on the lake. How is it she hadn’t noticed the expression of the citizens, not the\
 ones fluttering in and out of taxis, but the ones at bus stops, hopping like sparrows, shivering\
 and peering anxiously for the next bus, and those descending wearily into the filthy bowels\
 of the subway like the souls condemned to purgatory.(purgatory - place of suffering)\
    At first the Grandmother was thrilled by the restaurants and the big discount chains—\
 (line 55) but then the routine got to be too familiar. Saturdays in search of houses that were not to\
 her liking. Dark brick houses with small, squinty windows, gloomy apartments, or damp\
 little bungalows, everything somber and sad and not letting in enough light, and no\
 courtyards, a dank, (dank - damp) mean gangway, a small patch of thin grass called a garden, and maybe a\
 bald tree in front. This wasn’t what she had in mind.\
 (line 60)   And as the weeks and months passed, and she was still without a house, the rainy, cold\
 autumn weather began and only made her feel worse. There was the Chicago winter\
 coming that everyone had warned her about, and she was already so cold and miserable she\
 didn’t feel much like leaving her room, let alone the building. She blamed Ninfa, who kept\
 lowering the heat in order to save money. The Grandmother confined herself to bed,\
 (line 65) satisfied only when she was under several layers of blankets. …\
    But nothing, nothing in the Grandmother’s imagination prepared her for the horrors of\
 a Chicago winter. It was not the picturesque (picturesque - charming) season of Christmas, but the endless tundra\
 of January, February, and March. Daylight dimmed to a dull pewter. (pewter - gray) The sun a thick piece\
 of ice behind a dirty woolen sky. It was a cold like you can’t imagine, a barbarous thing, a\
 (line 70) knife in the bone, a cold so cold it burned the lungs if one could even believe such a cold.\
 And the mountains of filthy snow shoveled in huge heaps, the chunks of ice on the sidewalk\
 that could kill an aged citizen. —Oh, this is nothing, you should’ve been here for the Big\
 Snow, the grandchildren bragged, speaking of the recent storm of ’68.\
    Big snow or little snow, it was all the same after the novelty of snow had worn off. A\
 (line 75) nuisance, a deadly thing, an exaggerated, long, drawn-out ordeal that made one feel like\
 dying, that killed one slowly, a torture. Let me die in February, let me die rather than have\
 to step out the door again, please, the Grandmother thought to herself, dreading having to\
 dress like a monster to go outside. —Ay, ya no puedo. I can’t anymore, I can’t. And just\
 when she could no longer, when she could no longer find the strength, the drive, the will to\
 (line 80) keep on living, when she was ready to fold into herself and let her spirit die, just then, and\
 only then, did April arrive with sky the color of hope and branches filled with possibilities.\

Alan is on a volcano on Titan, a moon of Saturn. As the story opens, Alan is stranded on its summit in his space crawler. Luckily, he has brought along his mechanical wings.\
 \
 Excerpt from Fly for Your Life\
 \
 by John Frizell\
 \
 (paragraph 1) Alan knew there was no way back to the base and no way the crew there could help him remotely—the other crawler was down for maintenance. He could go down this side of the stream for 23 kilometers, to a flat area where the flowing liquid would spread out and be shallow enough to cross; then go back 23 kilometers to the far side of the bridge. One problem: he would definitely run out of air before he got there.\
 \
 (paragraph 2) Then Alan thought of the folded flight wings he had attached to his suit. Could he fly across the river and then walk to the base? Some quick calculations showed it wouldn’t work. He had enough air, but the battery that powered the heater of the suit he wore to stay alive on Titan was only good for an hour, not the four-hour walk it would take to reach the base. Spacewalks were usually done trailing a power cable plugged in to the suit. The cable carried power from the crawler to supplement the suit’s battery. Without the supplemental power, he would freeze solid in 10 minutes once the battery was exhausted.\
 \
 (paragraph 3) Alan knew flying the whole way was impossible. Even with Titan’s thick atmosphere and low gravity the suit made flying hard work, worse than running uphill carrying a sack of cement. No one could stay aloft for more than 10 minutes. It would be at least a half-hour flight to the base.\
 \
 (paragraph 4) He needed more than wings alone to get back alive. Then it came to him. Bolted to the side of the crawler was a squat, black cylinder containing compressed nitrogen at 200 bar, compressed Titanian atmosphere in fact, used for cleaning gunk off the crawler’s treads. Alan struggled with the bolts, working carefully in the searing cold with tools as brittle as glass. When he had the cylinder off, propped up, and pointing at the sky, he put his wings on, and then took them off, repeating the task until he could do it without thinking about it. . . .\
 \
 (paragraph 5) He pulled the power cable out of his suit’s hip socket and, before he could change his mind, gave a sharp tug on a line that he had attached to the valve of the pressure cylinder. The cylinder hissed like a giant snake, as high-pressure nitrogen blasted out, and then shot into the sky. A length of climbing rope he had attached to it went taut and snatched him into the air, where he was buffeted and tossed by the jet of nitrogen pouring down on him. It was like being caught under a breaking wave, pounded again and again by the surf. He was directly under the cylinder, using his weight and drag to keep the nozzle pointed down as the cylinder lofted him into Titan’s sky. The ground beneath, blurred by the motion, made it impossible to gauge height or direction.\
 \
 (paragraph 6) Time slowed; his shuddering world narrowed to the readout of the Titan Positioning System (TPS)—the icy moon’s equivalent of GPS. Gradually, the pounding lessened as the rate of climb shown on the readout passed its peak and began falling. Alan waited. Just before it hit zero, he cut the rope. The cylinder, relieved of his drag, flew off, dwindling to a black dot and then disappearing into the empty sky above. Now he was coasting upward, propelled by the momentum imparted to him by the nitrogen rocket. He was high in the air, but already he was slowing under the drag of the thick atmosphere. He had to get the wings on before the downward fall began. Once he started to move with some speed, he would begin to spin and never get them on. The first wing stuck and he had to take his arm out of the loops and try again. . . .\
 \
 (paragraph 7) He was gathering speed on his way down before he got the second one on. He spread his wings and rolled into a comfortable position, soaring over the moon’s dimly lit surface. The TPS showed that he was heading away from the base. He banked in an easy curve and settled on a course for home. All he had to do was hold the wings rigid and enjoy the ride. He took an occasional flap, just for fun. . . .\
 \
 (paragraph 8) As Alan glided toward the base, he flapped more often, watching the height-abovesurface and distance-to-target displays. As they unwound, an unpleasant feeling, like a trace of the frigid atmosphere outside, crept into his stomach. His elevation was dropping dangerously, with over three kilometers left to go on distance-to-target. He could see details on the surface more clearly now, because he was flying so low. . . .\
 \
 (paragraph 9) Alan forced himself to stay calm. Panic would mean disaster. He started flapping his wings faster, faster, faster. . . . He could feel himself lifting with every beat of the massive appendages. Faster, faster, faster. . . . His descent rate began to slow, but the muscles in his arms burned with pain. . . .\
 \
 (paragraph 10) Time stretched out endlessly.\
 \
 (paragraph 11) The TPS buzzed loudly in his helmet. Target. the station’s beacon was directly below him. He could barely feel his arms, but something made them stop flapping. He gratefully fell out of the sky, wrapped in a ball of pain, with barely the strength to flare his wings one last time for a soft landing. . . .\
 \
 (paragraph 12) Then he saw someone running toward him with a power cable in hand. Voices boomed into his helmet. It sounded like the whole station was in the control room waiting to see if he had made it.\
 \
 (paragraph 13) “Alan! ALAN! Say something! Can you move? Are you receiving this?” He recognized the voice of the base leader. . . .\
 \
 (paragraph 14) As the crew lifted him carefully onto a stretcher, he looked up at Titan’s hazy sky. I flew for my life today, he thought. I survived. That’s the only record that matters.\
What quotation best reveals Alan’s character?\
(A) “As Alan glided toward the base, he flapped more often, watching the height-above-surface and distance-to-target displays.” (paragraph 8)\
 (B) “He could see details on the surface more clearly now, because he was flying so low.” (paragraph 8)\

“Janet Guthrie: Lady in the Fast\
 Lane” from Profifiles in Sports Courage\
 by Ken Rappoport\
 \
 (paragraph 1) It was no surprise that Janet Guthrie excelled at one of the most dangerous sports on Earth. She had always loved adventure and daring new experiences.\
 (paragraph 2) Janet was born on March 7, 1938, in Iowa City, Iowa, and lived on a farm for the first few years of her life. Her father, an airline pilot, later moved the family to South Florida, where Janet took up flying.\
 (paragraph 3) At 13, she had already flown an airplane. At age 16, Janet decided she wanted to try a free-fall parachute jump. In free-fall, the parachutist jumps out of a plane without opening the chute. After falling several hundred feet at more than 100 miles an hour, the cord is pulled to open the chute. Then, if all goes well, the parachutist floats safely to the ground.\
 (paragraph 4) Her father wouldn’t hear of it. “Absolutely not,” he said. “No free-fall!”\
 (paragraph 5) But Janet persisted. Finally, her father gave in. “Just one time,” he said, “but you have to be careful and do it the right way.”\
 (paragraph 6) He would allow her to jump only on two conditions: He would fly the plane and she would receive parachuting lessons before the jump.\
 (paragraph 7) Since there were no parachuting schools in South Florida at the time, Janet’s father hired a pro to give her private lessons. In her autobiography, Janet Guthrie—A Life at Full Throttle, Janet said the pro taught her how to pull the rip cord that opened the chute, how to absorb the shock after landing, and how to fasten the helmet so it wouldn’t fly off.\
 ♦ ♦ ♦\
 (paragraph 8) By the time she was 21, she had earned a commercial pilot’s license. She flew whenever she could break away from her classes at the University of Michigan.\
 (paragraph 9) After graduating, Guthrie got a job as a physicist in the aerospace industry. She saved her money for an entire year and bought a car. Guthrie wasn’t satisfied with just any car. She chose a Jaguar XK 120—the sleek and popular sports car that she had dreamed about since she was a teenager.\
 aerospace = a business involved with space flight\
 (paragraph 10) At first, Guthrie enjoyed just driving the car around Long Island, outside New York City. Then she heard about a local sports car club where members could compete. She loved her car and wanted to see how it would do on a track. Soon she was entering races—and winning them.\
 (paragraph 11) Excited by her success, Guthrie attended a driving school in Connecticut. She was a natural. Her instructor, veteran driver Gordon McKenzie, liked the way she handled her car. He suggested she try auto racing.\
 (paragraph 12) A thrill shot through Guthrie. What a great idea. Off she went to enroll in a racing car drivers’ school sponsored by the Sports Car Club of America. Guthrie swapped her Jaguar for a higher-priced model built especially for racing—the XK 140. Before long she taught herself how to take apart and rebuild its engine like a pro.\
 ♦ ♦ ♦\
 (paragraph 13) Guthrie’s career started to pick up speed.\
 (paragraph 14) She entered races all over the United States, finishing in some of the country’s most celebrated long-distance competitions. In 1973, she won the North Atlantic Road Racing Championship. A champion, yes, but a tired champion. By then she had been racing for 13 years. She was exhausted, broke, and thinking of leaving the sport.\
 (paragraph 15) That’s when she got the phone call. Someone named Vollstedt was asking her to drive his car in the 1976 Indy 500. No woman had ever driven in that race. This has to be a prank, thought Guthrie. But Vollstedt, an auto designer and builder from Oregon, wasn’t kidding. Could she drive a “championship” car? That was the big question.\
 (paragraph 16) With their open cockpits, wide wheelbases, and rear engines, championship cars were much different than the closed sports cars Guthrie had been accustomed to driving for many years.\
 (paragraph 17) “Before she would agree to drive for me,” Vollstedt said, “she wanted to see if she could handle the car.”\
 (paragraph 18) Vollstedt was wondering the same thing, too. He arranged for a secret test at the Ontario Motor Speedway near Los Angeles.\
 (paragraph 19) To get into top physical shape for Vollstedt’s test, Guthrie did exercises in front of her TV. One day she lost her balance, landed hard on her left foot, and fell to the floor. The doctors told her she had broken a bone and they put her foot in a heavy cast. How am I going to drive a racing car? she worried. Will I miss my big chance?\
 ♦ ♦ ♦\
 (paragraph 20) Broken ankle and all, Guthrie stepped into an unfamiliar car. She hit the accelerator. When her car got up to speed, Guthrie couldn’t believe the feeling. “What a thrill,” she said. “It was like going to the moon.”\
 (paragraph 21) Vollstedt was impressed with her time—an average speed of 178.52 miles per hour and a top speed of 196 mph.\
 (paragraph 22) Test passed.\
 (paragraph 23) She had showed Vollstedt she could drive the car. Now she had to show the rest of the world.\
Which detail from the article best represents Janet Guthrie?\
(A) “She had always loved adventure and daring new experiences.” (paragraph 1)\
 (B) “Excited by her success, Guthrie attended a driving school in Connecticut.” (paragraph 11)\
 (C) “In 1973, she won the North Atlantic Road Racing Championship.” (paragraph 14)\
 (D) “Broken ankle and all, Guthrie stepped into an unfamiliar car.” (paragraph 20)\

In West Africa, the Harmattan is a dry, dust-filled wind.\
 Excerpt from A Scrap and a Robe\
 by Myrina D. McCullough\
 \
 (paragraph 1) The West African Harmattan whipped up a billow of dust. Suddenly Sali spied a scrap of glorious orange damask cloth turning in the hot wind like a flame. She followed as it danced down a street she didn’t know very well. She skipped over holes and skirted people on chairs.\
 damask = woven cloth\
 skirted = went around\
 (paragraph 2) All at once the wind died down, and the scrap settled gently on the scratchy, sandy road.\
 (paragraph 3) Sali picked up the cloth and gazed at it with admiring eyes. She turned it this way and that in the sun and imagined herself in a flowing dlokibani made of such cloth. This was a treasure, and she would take it home for her little wooden doll. It would surely make a lovely headpiece for that lucky one.\
 dlokibani or dloki = a long dress\
 (paragraph 4) Sali wandered back the way she had come, slowly now. At the corner of the street, she passed the table vendor, who was selling his dusty packets of tea and two-pill packs of aspirin. She passed Ami’s mother, roasting peanuts and selling them by the handful. She turned onto the larger street and passed a plastic-goods store that displayed rows and rows of brightly colored plastic plates, bowls, and teapots. She glanced into the next shop and then stopped short. It was a fabric shop! There on the high counter was an entire bolt of the same wondrous cloth she held in her hand!\
 (paragraph 5) The next day Sali went back to the cloth shop. She stood near the door and watched the storekeeper. He measured and cut, as one person after another bought pieces of cloth. Her prized orange damask was back on a high shelf to the rear of the store.\
 (paragraph 6) After a while the shopkeeper looked at Sali. “Why do you stand so long at the door?” he asked.\
 (paragraph 7) Sali took a deep breath and said, “I would like to help you in the store till I could earn enough of that orange cloth to make a dlokibani for myself.”\
 (paragraph 8) The orange fabric glowed in a shaft of light from the uncovered bulb at the back of the store.\
 (paragraph 9) “That is very special and expensive cloth, little one,” the shopkeeper told her.\
 (paragraph 10) So she swept the courtyard and threw away scraps. She pushed big rolls of cloth back and forth. She ran to buy cough drops and peanuts and kola nuts for the shopkeeper. For days and days she worked.\
 (paragraph 11) Finally, one day the store owner lifted down the lustrous roll of orange damask and measured out several yards. “You’ve worked well for this cloth, Sali,” he said. “I thank you.”\
 (paragraph 12) Sali rushed straight home with her treasure. Carefully she placed the cloth in her trunk.\
 (paragraph 13) But how was she to get the dloki made? Sali did not know how to sew. Her mother always had their clothes made by a tailor who sat in a tiny shop several blocks from their house.\
 (paragraph 14) Sali went and stood under a tree near the tailor’s shop. She watched the people come and go. The tailor would whip out his measuring tape and see how tall the people were, how fat they were, how long their arms, how short their necks. He measured every part of them.\
 (paragraph 15) After almost a whole day the tailor noticed Sali.\
 (paragraph 16) “What are you doing there, little girl?” he asked.\
 (paragraph 17) “I have some beautiful cloth,” she said, “and I want it sewn into a dlokibani. Could I work for you to pay for sewing it into a robe for me?”\
 (paragraph 18) The tailor agreed. Once again Sali worked for days and days. She swept and fanned the tea coals and held scissors and brought thread. At last, the tailor said, “Bring me the cloth, Sali.”\
 (paragraph 19) Sali rushed home and brought back the satiny, shining cloth. She also brought her doll, its small head still neatly wrapped in the swatch of orange. The tailor took his tape and measured Sali, shoulder to ankle, shoulder to elbow, left shoulder to right shoulder. Then he started cutting the billows of orange fabric.\
 (paragraph 20) The next day was an important holiday called Tabaski. Drums were beating in many neighborhoods. Relatives and friends came to visit Sali’s family. Sali slipped quietly away. Soon her mother missed her. “Now where has Sali gone?” she exclaimed.\
 (paragraph 21) Just then, Sali walked in, proudly wearing a beautiful orange dloki with a matching headdress. In her arms she carried her doll, dressed exactly as she was!\
What can the reader infer about the shopkeeper and the tailor?\
(A) They are clever and proud.\
 (B) They are tense and distracted.\
 (C) They are silly and foolish.\
 (D) They are fair and generous.\

Three Types of British Colonies in North America\
  | Colony Governed by Corporate Charter | Royal Colony | Proprietary Colony\
 King’s Relationship to the Colony | The king granted land to a company. The company governed this land. The charter companies were usually selfgoverned and the people\
 retained their English rights. | The king and his ministers ruled the land. | The king granted land to a family, person, or group of people. These people (proprietors) had as much governing power as the king over their lands.\
 How the Governor is Chosen | The governor was elected by those qualified to vote. | The king appointed a governor and a council of assistants. The governor had veto power. | The proprietor usually appointed a governor and a council of assistants.\
 How the Legislature is Chosen | The two-house legislature (upper and lower houses) was elected by the voters. | The governor and the council acted as the upper house. The lower house was elected by voters. | The governor and the council were the upper house. The lower house was elected by voters.\

 \
 Excerpt from River of Dreams\
 by Hudson Talbott\
 \
 (paragraph 1) By the twentieth century, New York City had long since reached its destiny of\
 becoming the most powerful city in America. In less than 300 years it had grown from\
 a tiny Dutch outpost in the wilderness to the business capital of the world. It was a city\
 built on dreams.\
 (paragraph 2) But it was made out of bricks and cement that had come from the banks of the\
 Hudson. The river which had fed all those dreams was now fading into the background.\
 New York didn’t seem to need the river anymore, except as a sewer. And that’s what it\
 became.\
 (paragraph 3) Industry on the river had made some New Yorkers filthy rich. But it had just made\
 the river filthy. Garbage, factory waste, plant chemicals and the raw sewage of the cities\
 and towns along its banks were dumped directly into the river. The water turned\
 greenish brown, except by the GM plant, where it turned red or yellow or whatever\
 color they were painting the cars that day.\
 (paragraph 4) The fishing industry collapsed. The few fish that survived were too poisonous to eat.\
 Smog from the factory smoke and dust from the cement plants blanketed the valley.\
 And it was all legal.\
 (paragraph 5) Most people don’t start out with dreams of polluting a river. But it was often the\
 result of people chasing their dreams of wealth with little care of how they reached it.\
 The Hudson Valley had always drawn them.\
 (paragraph 6) But now there were other dreamers in the valley, with their own dreams of wealth.\
 They dreamed of the wealth of wildlife in a healthy forest, the abundance of fish in\
 oxygen-rich water, and the great fortune of living in a beautiful river valley.\
 (paragraph 7) So perhaps it was a matter of time before the two types of dreamers would meet each\
 other—in court.\
 (paragraph 8) In 1963, Con Edison, New York City’s power company, proposed a plan for\
 constructing the largest hydroelectric pumping station ever built. The plan called for\
 carving out a gigantic hole in the side of majestic Storm King Mountain on the Hudson\
 River.\
 (paragraph 9) But then they met Franny Reese. Franny was a longtime valley resident with a simple\
 point to make: the mountain could not speak for itself. If she didn’t speak for it, who\
 would?\
 (paragraph 10) Franny and a group of like-minded people founded Scenic Hudson and took on the\
 power company in a landmark court case. Con Ed challenged the right of private\
 citizens to participate, but the court sided with the citizens, in the ruling now known as\
 the Scenic Hudson Decision.\
 (paragraph 11) After dragging out the case for seventeen years, Con Ed finally gave up and Storm\
 King survived unblemished. It was the beginning of the environmental movement in\
 this country, and once again, the Hudson Valley was the birthplace.\
 (paragraph 12) More and more people joined the movement as they realized how much difference\
 each of us can make.\
 (paragraph 13) The love of their land was still alive in the hearts of Americans, and now that it was\
 aroused again, things began to change.\
 (paragraph 14) Many new laws and new citizens’ groups have been inspired by those early heroes of\
 the environment, and their work has begun to bring the Hudson back to life.\
 (paragraph 15) The Mahicans called it “The River That Flows Both Ways.” Slowly we are learning\
 that taking care of the river is the only way that the river can take care of us.\
 (paragraph 16) Fifty years have passed since I dreamed of going to New York to see the river that\
 shares my name, and thirty-five years since that dream came true. I live in the Hudson\
 Valley now, grateful to all those who came before me, following their dreams to this\
 river, building this nation, sharing its beauty, securing its future.\
 (paragraph 17) It’s now my turn to help in keeping the river of dreams flowing, for all those\
 dreamers yet to come.\
As used in paragraph 2, what does the phrase “fading into the background” mean?\
(A) disappearing from view\
 (B) losing its importance in people’s minds\
 (C) moving farther and farther from the city\
 (D) remaining important only to those who value nature\

Base your answers to questions 7 and 8 on the passage below and on your knowledge of social studies.\
 \
 . . . Owing to the extensive use of machinery and to division of labor, the work of the proletarians has lost all individual character, and, consequently, all charm for the workman. He becomes an appendage [accessory] of the machine, and it is only the most simple, most monotonous, and most easily acquired knack [skill] that is required of him. Hence, the cost of production of a workman is restricted, almost entirely, to the means of subsistence that he requires for his maintenance, and for the propagation [reproduction] of his race. But the price of a commodity, and also of labor, is equal to its cost of production. In proportion, therefore, as the repulsiveness of the work increases, the wage decreases. Nay more, in proportion as the use of machinery and division of labor increases, in the same proportion the burden of toil also increases, whether by prolongation [stretching] of the working hours, by increase of the work exacted in a given time, or by increased speed of machinery, etc. . . .\

 Excerpt from The Woolly-Puff Rescue\
 \
 by Sue Mozena\
 \
 (paragraph 1) Wendy and Alex stared at the strange ﬂower at their feet. Dozens of them bloomed in this remote corner of the ﬁeld.\
 \
 (paragraph 2) Wendy bent down for a closer look. “We shouldn’t name them until we’re sure we can keep them,” she warned. “But I like Woolly-Puffs. They look just like ﬂeecy rainbows.”\
 \
 (paragraph 3) As tempting as it was to pet the feathery yellow-orange-red-purple-blue petals, neither of them did. Instead, Wendy pulled protective gloves from her belt pack.\
 \
 (paragraph 4) On the asteroid-based colony of New Harmony, even twelve-year-old pioneers knew the number one rule for living in outer space: don’t touch or taste or sniff anything that hasn’t been tested.\
 \
 (paragraph 5) “Where do you think they came from?” Wendy asked. With a gentle tug, she freed a Woolly-Puff from the thin layer of soil, sealed it in a clear bag.\
 \
 (paragraph 6) “They were probably in the compost shipment that brought these naggers,” Alex muttered. He slapped at one of the whining insects that swarmed around him looking for exposed skin to bite.\
 \
 compost = a mixture of decaying plants used to improve the soil in a garden\
 \
 (paragraph 7) New Harmony depended on shipments of rich compost from nearby planets to build up its soil. Usually the compost was treated before it arrived, but one shipment had been accidentally overlooked. The whining gnat-like insects the colonists called “naggers” had hatched from the compost. Without any natural enemies in this new world, the insects had multiplied, becoming a constant torment to the colonists.\
 \
 (paragraph 8) After turning in their discovery, Wendy settled on a stone bench in front of the New Harmony laboratory. Alex paced, then sat. “Poor Woolly-Puff,” Wendy said. “What if it’s just a weedy ﬂower?”\
 \
 (paragraph 9) “Then one living plant and a packet of seeds will be sent to the Botany Preserve on Mars,” Alex answered, rubbing a hot-pink nagger welt just above his elbow.\
 \
 (paragraph 10) Wendy gingerly held the extra bouquet she had picked, in case the Woolly-Puffs proved keepers. “And the rest of the plants—”\
 \
 (paragraph 11) “The rest will be pulled up and destroyed to make room for ‘useful’ plants,” Alex said.\
 \
 (paragraph 12) The colony of New Harmony did have ﬂowers. It just didn’t have a lot of room. Woolly-Puffs would have to be more than pretty if they wanted to grow here.\
 \
 (paragraph 13) The two friends scrambled to attention as the lab door opened.\
 \
 (paragraph 14) “Your Woolly-Puff isn’t toxic,” Professor Raglin said. His smile faded as he went on. “The sap is thick and sticky, but we already have a good glue. The stems are too woody and the leaves too bristly to eat. And the petals, well, they smell funny. Not ﬂowery at all. More like moldy lemons. I’m sorry, but I’ll have to make my report to the council this afternoon. The good news is that they seem to grow only in the soil where you found them, so it won’t be hard to get rid of them.”\
 \
 (paragraph 15) “At least they’re not poison,” Wendy said after Professor Raglin had left. She hugged her colorful, fuzzy bouquet. She had to admit they did smell funny. “Mayor Murphy will probably send a reclaim crew out after the council meeting.” She sighed. “I wish the council would let us adopt one, like a pet.”\
 \
 (paragraph 16) “Fat chance,” Alex said. He blew at a pair of naggers trying to land on his knee. “Shoo! For harmless gnats, these bugs sure are pests.”\
 \
 (paragraph 17) “Yeah.” Wendy reached up to scratch the end of her nose. Then she realized something. The end of her nose itched simply because that’s what the ends of noses do sometimes. The naggers weren’t biting her. They weren’t even landing on her.\
 \
 (paragraph 18) “We’re going to the council meeting,” she announced.\
 \
 (paragraph 19) That afternoon, when the council members emerged from the community center, Alex and Wendy were waiting.\
 \
 (paragraph 20) “What is the meaning of this?” Mayor Murphy demanded as Alex and Wendy presented each member of the council with a Woolly-Puff garland.\
 \
 (paragraph 21) Glancing at Alex for courage, Wendy said, “Woolly-Puffs are bug chasers.”\
 \
 (paragraph 22) “Sorry,” Mayor Murphy said ﬁrmly. “We have already made our decision.”\
 \
 (paragraph 23) “Just watch,” Wendy pleaded. “Watch the naggers.”\
 \
 (paragraph 24) Then someone said, “What naggers? I don’t see any.”\
 \
 (paragraph 25) “Where are the naggers?” asked Professor Raglin. “It’s as if they’re avoiding us.”\
 \
 (paragraph 26) Wendy smiled. “They are. Naggers don’t like Woolly-Puffs.”\
 \
 (paragraph 27) So the Woolly-Puffs stayed in the vases and ﬂower boxes and gardens of New Harmony because, of course, they weren’t just pretty. They smelled like moldy lemons. And luckily, naggers couldn’t stand the smell of moldy lemons.\
In paragraph 2, what does the sentence “They look just like ﬂeecy rainbows” suggest about the ﬂowers?\
(A) The ﬂowers are colorful and fuzzy.\
 (B) The ﬂowers are wet and ﬂuffy.\
 (C) The ﬂowers are striped and shaggy.\
 (D) The ﬂowers are transparent and puffy.\

The First Public Park\
 by Marcia Amidon Lusted\
 \
 It was just an idea for more than a decade, but by 1857, New Yorkers were serious\
 about building a grand public park. New York was the largest metropolis in the nation,\
 and its citizens wanted to show the world that Americans were not just concerned about\
 industry, wealth, and materialism but that they also appreciated natural landscapes.\
 (line 5) Using eminent domain, the city took more than 840 acres of land in the center of\
 Manhattan for the new park. The area was considered to lack any real estate value—it\
 included swamps, bluffs, and rock outcroppings as well as two reservoirs that supplied city\
 water. It was home to about 1,600 poor residents, however. This population of pig farmers,\
 gardeners, and an African American settlement called Seneca Village was displaced by the\
 (line 10) park’s construction.\
 The Central Park Commission held a competition to choose someone to design the\
 park. Among the professional and amateur designers who entered the contest was a team\
 consisting of an American agriculturalist and a British-born architect: Frederick Law\
 Olmsted and Calvert Vaux.\
 (line 15) It was Vaux’s idea for the two men to join forces. A talented draftsman, Vaux used his\
 detailed drawings to show how their idea for the park would look. An accomplished\
 writer, Olmsted wrote the report that described their plan and included lists of proposed\
 plants and an estimated budget. They submitted their plan, called “Greensward,” a day\
 after the commission’s deadline.\
 (line 20) Greensward included pastoral views and rolling meadows, just like those in traditional\
 English parks. The plan offered beautiful vistas of green lawns and natural rocky ridges as\
 well as more formal locations for public gatherings.\
 It also included four roads that cut through the park to carry carriage traffic from one\
 side to the other. Olmsted and Vaux designed these major thoroughfares to run eight feet\
 (line 25) below the park’s surface so they would not disrupt the park’s views and rural feeling.\
 Pedestrian paths, equestrian roads, and carriage drives were all kept separate from one\
 another. Vaux designed more than 40 bridges so that these various paths would never have\
 to cross on the same level.\
 Unlike some of the other submissions that included grand, elaborate buildings,\
 (line 30) Olmsted and Vaux kept structures to a minimum, with only four in the original plan. The\
 design and materials for the buildings were also specifically selected to blend in with the\
 natural environment.\
 Greensward was announced the winner in the spring of 1858. The selection committee\
 debated over certain design points—some of the members wanted a wide grand avenue in\
 (line 35) the park, similar to those found in European parks. Olmsted argued against it by saying\
 that stately roads would “destroy scenery at great cost” and that “straight lines of trees or\
 stately architecture . . . belong not to parks for the people but to palatial gardens.” Olmsted\
 and Vaux had created their design for the recreation of all people, not just the wealthy.\
 The park was to be a place where all New Yorkers could enjoy nature. Its ultimate design\
 (line 40) would retain this feeling.\
 The construction of Central Park was one of the most massive public works projects\
 to take place in 19th-century New York. It required about 20,000 workers to reshape the\
 natural features of the land according to Olmsted and Vaux’s plan. Three hundred\
 thousand cubic yards of rock were blasted into rubble, and the resulting stone was crushed\
 (line 45) to use as paving material. Nearly three million cubic yards of soil were moved, and more\
 than 270,000 trees and shrubs were planted. Swamps were transformed into scenic lakes,\
 and extensive drainage work was done to get rid of small streams and pools. By 1866,\
 more than $5 million had been spent on construction. The park’s final price tag was more\
 than $10 million. In the end, this entirely planned park, stretching from 59th Street to\
 (line 50) 110th Street and from Fifth to Eighth avenues, had a completely natural, unplanned\
 feeling to it.\
 The process of overseeing the park’s construction and accounting for its expenditures\
 exhausted Olmsted. He required a six-week rest cure in Europe in 1859 and suffered a\
 severe broken leg in 1860 that laid him up, but he had the plans for the park spread out in\
 (line 55) his bedroom so he could continue to work. When he tried to resign from the project in\
 1861, however, the commission knew that it could not afford to lose him. Ultimately,\
 Olmsted’s duties and responsibilities were decreased, and when he departed the project to\
 serve in the U.S. Sanitary Commission during the Civil War (1861–1865), the park’s\
 construction was completed under park commission president Andrew Green and Vaux.\
 (line 60) Olmsted’s involvement in Central Park spanned nearly 20 years. It was not the only\
 site he worked or consulted on, and, for a couple of years, other projects demanded his\
 full attention. But from the time their plan was selected until the mid-1870s, Olmsted and\
 Vaux were associated with the park on and off. Sometimes, their titles as landscape\
 architect advisors required little on-site work. At other times, such as when Olmsted filled\
 (line 65) in as acting president of the Department of Public Parks, he looked into establishing lights\
 in the park at night and assessing the park’s safety. By 1878, however, Olmsted’s role with\
 the park officially ended.\
 Today, Central Park stands as one of Olmsted’s greatest legacies. It contains numerous\
 playgrounds and athletic fields. Runners and bicyclists make use of the wide, rolling paths.\
 (line 70) There are places to skate in the winter and boat in the summer. Concerts, plays, and rallies\
 take place there. Sculptures by famous artists can be found throughout the park. There are\
 also quiet places to walk, sit and read a book, or watch birds. Central Park has become a\
 world-famous site that attracts more than 25 million visitors each year. It also is a shining\
 example of Olmsted’s desire to create and preserve public green spaces in urban places for\
 (line 75) generations of people to enjoy.\

. . . When women in the Third World are raised to higher status, they do more than limit the size of their families; they also are the group most likely to take action to increase the food supply and control disease. Grassroots humanitarian organizations believe that investment in women’s enterprises is the best intervention they can make in developing nations where women do most of the farming. And UNICEF discovered during the 1970s that women were the key to implementing public health measures. Educated women support vaccination programs, understand the need for clean water supplies, and persuade family members to seek professional medical aid before an entire village becomes infected. . . .\

 \
 Sir: If you were to offer a Nation of the Year award, my vote would go to Israel. For the past 19 years, this bastion [stronghold] of democracy has survived in spite of the Arab commandment “harass thy neighbor.” This tiny nation may yet fulfill the Biblical prophecy of being a “light unto all nations.” Let’s hope the U.A.R. [United Arab Republic] is one of the first to see the light. \

 \
 Sir: TIME’S lavish contribution, in the form of a cover story, to the Israeli cause is exceeded only by the distorted, sketchy coverage afforded the plight of the Arabs. Neither eloquent oratory [moving speeches] nor military victories can decide the rights of people. Win or lose, the underlying principle for the Arab struggle is no less justified. Where was indignant [angry] world opinion in 1947 when “third parties” paid off political debts with land that they did not own? Where were those who now call for justice when these parties permitted the Arab to be ejected from land he has owned for generations? Perhaps only history will vindicate [justify] the Arab cause, but what of today?\

 (2) The survival of Israel is threatened by distorted and sketchy reporting.\

In this excerpt, the author talks about introducing her chickens to her yard.\
 \
 Excerpt from Birdology\
 by Sy Montgomery\
 \
 At first I was afraid they’d run away or become lost. We had a cozy, secure home for\
 them prepared in the bottom storey of our barn, with wood shavings scattered over the\
 dirt floor, a dispenser for fresh water, a trough for chick feed, some low perches made\
 from dowels, and a hay-lined nest box made from an old rabbit hutch left over from one\
 (line 5) of the barn’s previous denizens, in which they could lay future eggs. Chickens need to be\
 closed in safe at night to protect them from predators, but by day we didn’t want to\
 confine them; we wanted to give them free run of the yard. But how could they possibly\
 understand that they lived here now? Once we let them out, would they even recognize\
 their space in the barn and go back in it? When I was in seventh grade, my family had\
 (line 10) moved, once again, to a new house; my first afternoon there I literally got lost in my own\
 backyard. Could these six-week-old chicks be expected to know better?\
 Gretchen assured me there would be no problem. “Leave them in the pen for\
 twenty-four hours,” she told me. “Then you can let them out and they’ll stick around.\
 They’ll go back in again when it starts to get dark.”\
 (line 15) “But how do they know?” I asked.\
 “They just do,” she said. “Chickens just know these things.”\
 When before dusk, I found them all perched calmly back in their coop, I saw that\
 Gretchen was right.\
 In fact, chickens know many things, some from the moment they are born. Like all\
 (line 20) members of the order in which they are classified, the Galliformes, or game birds,\
 just-hatched baby chickens are astonishingly mature and mobile, able to walk, peck, and\
 run only hours after leaving the egg.\
 This developmental strategy is called precocial. Like its opposite, the altricial strategy\
 (employed by creatures such as humans and songbirds, who are born naked and helpless),\
 (line 25) the precocial strategy was sculpted by eons of adaptation to food and predators. If your\
 nest is on the ground, as most game birds’ are, it’s a good idea to get your babies out of\
 there as quickly as possible before someone comes to eat them. So newborn game birds\
 hatch covered in down, eyes open, and leave the nest within twenty-four hours. (An\
 Australian game bird known as the malleefowl begins its life by digging its way out of\
 (line 30) its nest of decaying vegetation and walks off into the bush without ever even meeting\
 either parent.)\
 That chickens hatch from the egg knowing how to walk, run, peck, and scratch has an\
 odd consequence: many people take this as further evidence they are stupid. But instinct is\
 not stupidity. (After all, Einstein was born knowing how to suckle.) Nor does instinct\
 (line 35) preclude learning. Unlike my disoriented seventh-grade self (and I have not improved\
 much since), young chickens have a great capacity for spatial learning. In scientific\
 experiments, researchers have trained days-old chicks to find hidden food using both\
 distant and nearby landmarks as cues. Italian researchers demonstrated that at the tender\
 age of fifteen days, after just a week’s training to find hidden food in the middle of their\
 (line 40) cage, chicks can correctly calculate the center of a given environment—even in the\
 absence of distinctive landmarks. Even more astonishing, they can do it in spaces they\
 have never seen before, whether the area be circular, square, or triangular. How? The\
 chicks “probably relied on a visual estimate of these distances from their actual positions,”\
 wrote University of Padova researcher L. Tommasi and co-authors in the Journal of\
 (line 45) Comparative Physiology, ”. . . [but] it remains to be determined how the chicks actually\
 measure distances in the task.”\
 We never determined how our first chickens knew their new home was theirs, either.\
 We never knew how they managed to discern the boundaries of our property. But they\
 did. At first, they liked to stay near the coop. But as they grew, they took to following me\
 (line 50) everywhere, first cheeping like the tinkling of little bells, later clucking in animated adult\
 discussion. If I was hanging out the laundry, they would check what was in the laundry\
 basket. If I was weeding a flower bed, they would join me, raking the soil with their\
 strong, scaly feet, then stepping backward to see what was revealed. (Whenever I worked\
 with soil, I suspect they assumed I was digging for worms.) When my husband, Howard,\
 (line 55) and I would eat at the picnic table under the big silver maple, the Ladies would\
 accompany us. When my father-in-law came to help my husband build a pen for\
 Christopher Hogwood, then still a piglet, the Ladies milled underfoot to supervise every\
 move. The hens were clearly interested in the project, pecking at the shiny nails, standing\
 tall to better observe the use of tools, clucking a running commentary all the while. Before\
 (line 60) this experience, Howard’s dad would have been the first to say that he didn’t think\
 chickens were that smart. But they changed his mind. After a few hours I noticed he\
 began to address them. Picking up a hammer they were examining, he might say, directly\
 and respectfully, “Pardon me, Ladies”—as if he were speaking to my mother-in-law and\
 me when we got in the way.\
 (line 65) But when their human friends are inside, and this is much of the time, the Ladies\
 explore on their own. A chicken can move as fast as nine miles an hour, which can take\
 you pretty far, and ours are free to go anywhere they like. But ours have intuited our\
 property lines and confine their travels to its boundaries. They have never crossed the\
 street. And for years, they never hopped across the low stone wall separating our land\
 (line 70) from that of our closest neighbor. That came later—and it was not the result of any\
 physical change in the landscape, but the outcome of a change in social relationships\
 among their human friends.\
Lines 49 through 59 develop the key idea that chickens raised by humans\
(A) are curious about the activities of their caregivers\
 (B) become a nuisance to the other projects of their owners\
 (C) grow to prefer the company of people over other chickens\
 (D) develop their intelligence more than chickens raised by hens\

This excerpt is from a book about the history of the Hudson River.\
 \
 Excerpt from River of Dreams\
 \
 by Hudson Talbott\
 \
 (paragraph 1) By the twentieth century, New York City had long since reached its destiny of becoming the most powerful city in America. In less than 300 years it had grown from a tiny Dutch outpost in the wilderness to the business capital of the world. It was a city built on dreams.\
 \
 (paragraph 2) But it was made out of bricks and cement that had come from the banks of the Hudson. The river which had fed all those dreams was now fading into the background. New York didn’t seem to need the river anymore, except as a sewer. And that’s what it became.\
 \
 (paragraph 3) Industry on the river had made some New Yorkers filthy rich. But it had just made the river filthy. Garbage, factory waste, plant chemicals and the raw sewage of the cities and towns along its banks were dumped directly into the river. The water turned greenish brown, except by the GM plant, where it turned red or yellow or whatever color they were painting the cars that day.\
 \
 (paragraph 4) The fishing industry collapsed. The few fish that survived were too poisonous to eat. Smog from the factory smoke and dust from the cement plants blanketed the valley. And it was all legal.\
 \
 (paragraph 5) Most people don’t start out with dreams of polluting a river. But it was often the result of people chasing their dreams of wealth with little care of how they reached it. The Hudson Valley had always drawn them.\
 \
 (paragraph 6) But now there were other dreamers in the valley, with their own dreams of wealth. They dreamed of the wealth of wildlife in a healthy forest, the abundance of fish in oxygen-rich water, and the great fortune of living in a beautiful river valley.\
 \
 (paragraph 7) So perhaps it was a matter of time before the two types of dreamers would meet each other—in court.\
 \
 (paragraph 8) In 1963, Con Edison, New York City’s power company, proposed a plan for constructing the largest hydroelectric pumping station ever built. The plan called for carving out a gigantic hole in the side of majestic Storm King Mountain on the Hudson River.\
 \
 (paragraph 9) But then they met Franny Reese. Franny was a longtime valley resident with a simple point to make: the mountain could not speak for itself. If she didn’t speak for it, who would?\
 \
 (paragraph 10) Franny and a group of like-minded people founded Scenic Hudson and took on the power company in a landmark court case. Con Ed challenged the right of private citizens to participate, but the court sided with the citizens, in the ruling now known as the Scenic Hudson Decision.\
 \
 (paragraph 11) After dragging out the case for seventeen years, Con Ed finally gave up and Storm King survived unblemished. It was the beginning of the environmental movement in this country, and once again, the Hudson Valley was the birthplace.\
 \
 (paragraph 12) More and more people joined the movement as they realized how much difference each of us can make.\
 \
 (paragraph 13) The love of their land was still alive in the hearts of Americans, and now that it was aroused again, things began to change.\
 \
 (paragraph 14) Many new laws and new citizens’ groups have been inspired by those early heroes of the environment, and their work has begun to bring the Hudson back to life.\
 \
 (paragraph 15) The Mahicans called it “The River That Flows Both Ways.” Slowly we are learning that taking care of the river is the only way that the river can take care of us.\
 \
 (paragraph 16) Fifty years have passed since I dreamed of going to New York to see the river that shares my name, and thirty-five years since that dream came true. I live in the Hudson Valley now, grateful to all those who came before me, following their dreams to this river, building this nation, sharing its beauty, securing its future.\
 \
 (paragraph 17) It’s now my turn to help in keeping the river of dreams flowing, for all those dreamers yet to come.\
Which claim from the article is least supported?\
(A) “New York didn’t seem to need the river anymore, except as a sewer. And that’s what it became.” (paragraph 2)\
 (B) “Industry on the river had made some New Yorkers filthy rich.” (paragraph 3)\
 (C) “But it had just made the river filthy.” (paragraph 3)\
 (D) “But now there were other dreamers in the valley, with their own dreams of wealth.” (paragraph 6)\

 Reading Comprehension Passage A\
 \
 The Count and the Wedding Guest\
 \
    Miss Maggie Conway and Mr. Andy Donovan are staying at the same boarding house in New York City.\
 \
    …Just coming out the door was Miss Conway. She wore a night-black dress of\
 crêpe de—crêpe de—oh, this thin black goods.(goods - fabric) Her hat was black, and from it drooped and\
 fluttered an ebon veil, filmy as a spider’s web. She stood on the top step and drew on black\
 silk gloves. Not a speck of white or a spot of color about her dress anywhere. Her rich\
 (line 5) golden hair was drawn, with scarcely a ripple, into a shining, smooth knot low on her neck.\
 Her face was plain rather than pretty, but it was now illuminated and made almost beautiful\
 by her large gray eyes that gazed above the houses across the street into the sky with an\
 expression of the most appealing sadness and melancholy. …\
    “It’s a fine, clear evening, Miss Conway,” he [Andy Donovan] said; and if the Weather\
 (line 10) Bureau could have heard the confident emphasis of his tones it would have hoisted the\
 square white signal, (square white signal - a sign of good weather) and nailed it to the mast.\
    “To them that has the heart to enjoy it, it is, Mr. Donovan,” said Miss Conway, with\
 a sigh. …\
    “I hope none of your relatives—I hope you haven’t sustained a loss?” ventured\
 (line 15) Mr. Donovan.\
    “Death has claimed,” said Miss Conway, hesitating—“not a relative, but one who—but\
 I will not intrude my grief upon you, Mr. Donovan.”\
    “Intrude?” protested Mr. Donovan. “Why, say, Miss Conway, I’d be delighted, that is,\
 I’d be sorry—I mean I’m sure nobody could sympathize with you truer than I would.”\
 (line 20)   Miss Conway smiled a little smile. And oh, it was sadder than her expression in repose. (repose - at rest) …\
    “It’s tough to be alone in New York—that’s a cinch,” said Mr. Donovan. “But, say—\
 whenever this little old town does loosen up and get friendly it goes the limit. Say you took\
 a little stroll in the park, Miss Conway—don’t you think it might chase away some of your\
 mullygrubs? And if you’d allow me—”\
 (line 25)   “Thanks, Mr. Donovan. I’d be pleased to accept of your escort if you think the company\
 of one whose heart is filled with gloom could be anyways agreeable to you.”\
    Through the open gates of the iron-railed, old, downtown park, where the elect once\
 took the air, they strolled, and found a quiet bench. …\
    “He was my fiancé,” confided Miss Conway, at the end of an hour. “We were going to\
 (line 30) be married next spring. I don’t want you to think that I am stringing you, Mr. Donovan, but\
 he was a real Count. He had an estate and a castle in Italy. Count Fernando Mazzini was\
 his name. I never saw the beat of him for elegance. Papa objected, of course, and once \
 we eloped, but papa overtook us, and took us back. I thought sure papa and Fernando \
 would fight a duel. Papa has a livery business—in P’kipsee [Poughkeepsie], you know.” … \
 (line 35)    “Three days ago I got a letter from Italy, forwarded from P’kipsee, saying that Fernando \
 had been killed in a gondola accident.” … \
    “I’ve got his picture here in my locket,” said Miss Conway, after wiping her eyes with \
 her handkerchief. “I never showed it to anybody; but I will to you, Mr. Donovan, because \
 I believe you to be a true friend.” \
 (line 40)   Mr. Donovan gazed long and with much interest at the photograph in the locket that \
 Miss Conway opened for him. The face of Count Mazzini was one to command interest. \
 It was a smooth, intelligent, bright, almost a handsome face—the face of a strong, cheerful \
 man who might well be a leader among his fellows. \
    “I have a larger one, framed, in my room,” said Miss Conway. “When we return I will\
 (line 45) show you that. They are all I have to remind me of Fernando. But he ever will be present \
 in my heart, that’s a sure thing.” \
    A subtle task confronted Mr. Donovan,—that of supplanting (supplanting - replacing) the unfortunate Count in \
 the heart of Miss Conway. This his admiration for her determined him to do. But the \
 magnitude of the undertaking did not seem to weigh upon his spirits. The sympathetic but\
 (line 50) cheerful friend was the role he essayed; (essayed - attempted) and he played it so successfully that the next \
 half-hour found them conversing pensively across two plates of ice-cream, though yet there \
 was no diminution of the sadness in Miss Conway’s large gray eyes. \
    Before they parted in the hall that evening she ran upstairs and brought down the \
 framed photograph wrapped lovingly in a white silk scarf. Mr. Donovan surveyed it with\
 (line 55) inscrutable (inscrutable - unreadable) eyes. … \
    “A fine-looking man,” said Mr. Donovan, heartily. “How would it suit you, Miss Conway, \
 to give me the pleasure of your company to Coney [Island] next Sunday afternoon?” \
    A month later they announced their engagement to Mrs. Scott and the other boarders. \
 Miss Conway continued to wear black.\
 (line 60)   A week after the announcement the two sat on the same bench in the downtown park, \
 while the fluttering leaves of the trees made a dim kinetoscopic (kinetoscopic - flickering) picture of them in the \
 moonlight. But Donovan had worn a look of abstracted gloom all day. He was so silent \
 to-night that love’s lips could not keep back any longer the questions that love’s heart \
 propounded. (propounded - put forward)\
 (line 65)   “What’s the matter, Andy, you are so solemn and grouchy to-night?”\
    “Nothing, Maggie.”\
    “I know better. Can’t I tell? You never acted this way before. What is it?” … \
    “I’ll tell you then,” said Andy, wisely, “but I guess you won’t understand it exactly. \
 You’ve heard of Mike Sullivan, haven’t you? ‘Big Mike’ Sullivan, everybody calls him.”\
 (line 70)   “No, I haven’t,” said Maggie. “And I don’t want to, if he makes you act like this. Who is \
 he?” …\
    “Well, Big Mike’s a friend of mine. I ain’t more than deuce-high in the district as far as \
 influence goes, but Mike’s as good a friend to a little man, or a poor man as he is to a big \
 one. I met him to-day on the Bowery [Street], and what do you think he does? Comes up\
 (line 75) and shakes hands. ‘Andy,’ says he, ‘I’ve been keeping cases on you. You’ve been putting in \
 some good licks over on your side of the street, and I’m proud of you. What’ll you take to \
 drink?’ He takes a cigar, and I take a highball. I told him I was going to get married in two \
 weeks. ‘Andy,’ says he, ‘send me an invitation, so I’ll keep in mind of it, and I’ll come to the \
 wedding.’ That’s what Big Mike says to me; and he always does what he says. \
 (line 80)   “You don’t understand it, Maggie, but I’d have one of my hands cut off to have Big Mike \
 Sullivan at our wedding. It would be the proudest day of my life. When he goes to a man’s \
 wedding, there’s a guy being married that’s made for life. Now, that’s why I’m maybe looking \
 sore to-night.”\
    “Why don’t you invite him, then, if he’s so much to the mustard?” (to the mustard - successful) said Maggie, lightly. …\
 (line 85)   “Maggie,” said Andy, presently, “do you think as much of me as you did of your—as you \
 did of the Count Mazzini?”\
    He waited a long time, but Maggie did not reply. And then, suddenly she leaned against \
 his shoulder and began to cry—to cry and shake with sobs, holding his arm tightly, and \
 wetting the crêpe de Chine with tears. …\
 (line 90)   But instead of being pushed away, she found Andy’s arm folding her closer. She looked \
 up and saw his face cleared and smiling. …\
    “Andy,” said Maggie, with a somewhat shy smile, after she had been thoroughly assured \
 of forgiveness, “did you believe all that story about the Count?” \
    “Well, not to any large extent,” said Andy, reaching for his cigar case, “because it’s\
 (line 95) Big Mike Sullivan’s picture you’ve got in that locket of yours.” \

Excerpt from The Call of Coney Island\
 \
 by Cynthia Overbeck Bix\
 \
 (paragraph 1) Salty ocean smells mingle with the aromas of sweet cotton candy and Nathan’s Famous hot dogs. The legendary Cyclone roller coaster lurches along its tracks—then takes a heart-stopping plunge. Riders whoop and scream with excitement. Farther down the boardwalk, the sound of a carousel starts. Patrons pitch balls at moving targets, hoping to win a prize. Welcome to Coney Island, the nation’s first truly modern amusement area.\
 \
 (paragraph 2) Located on the southern tip of Brooklyn, New York, Coney Island has been the place to go for fun for more than a century. The inspiration for amusement parks such as Coney Island sprang from an exciting event in 1893—the World’s Columbian Exposition in Chicago. It was one of the first venues where people experienced a variety of attractions in one large space. \
 \
 (paragraph 3) Visitors to Chicago gasped in wonder when they saw the fair’s “White City” spread out before them. Beautiful all-white exhibition buildings and large classical statues framed a lagoon of shimmering water. Designed to educate and inform, about a dozen grand buildings housed displays on the latest developments in transportation, machinery, agriculture, art, horticulture, and more. Most visitors had never seen the things they saw there, such as electric lights, a moving sidewalk, world-famous artwork, and moving pictures.\
 \
 (paragraph 4) While the World’s Columbian Exposition awed people with new innovations and ideas, its most popular attraction was the Midway Plaisance. Located in a separate section of the exhibition grounds, the Midway was filled with entertainment: rides, food stands, and sideshows. People could get a taste of international cultures, for example, by riding a camel through the Streets of Cairo or strolling among the thatched huts of a South Sea village. Best of all, they could ride George Ferris’s giant spinning wheel. Rising 264 feet above the Midway, this engineering marvel became the star of the fair. It was a spectacular example of what the new age of machines made possible.\
 \
 (paragraph 5) One visitor, New York showman George C. Tilyou, immediately saw potential for this new form of entertainment. Tilyou owned property on Coney Island, which already was an established beach resort with hotels, bathhouses, and restaurants. It also featured an odd collection of sideshows, food vendors, fortunetellers, and more. Tilyou decided to build an enclosed amusement park there.\
 \
 (paragraph 6) In 1897, Tilyou opened Steeplechase Park. When he was unable to buy Ferris’s wheel, he had his own version built. For 25 cents, visitors could ride Tilyou’s wheel, enjoy the Scenic Railway, or climb into a “spaceship” for a Trip to the Moon. On the Steeplechase, wooden horses carried riders along a metal racetrack from a starting gate to a finish line.\
 \
 (paragraph 7) Steeplechase Park’s huge success was partly due to another invention—electric railways. The first electric trolley line had connected Manhattan Island and Coney Island in the mid-1800s. By the turn of the 20th century, an electric train offered an even faster way to carry more people wanting to escape from the hot, crowded city.\
 \
 (paragraph 8) In the late 1800s and early 1900s, most people worked long hours and six days a week in urban factories and shops. But for a nickel fare, a city worker could afford a day’s outing to a nearby park on Sundays. Recognizing the value of giving the working class access to day trips, trolley and train companies established parks that were located at the end of a line. Travelers disembarked to enjoy simple outdoor pleasures in picnic groves and swimming pools or beaches. Eventually, merry-go-rounds, penny arcades, (penny arcades - indoor area with amusements such as games and photo booths operated by placing a coin in a slot) and even small roller coasters were added. . . .\
 \
 (paragraph 9) Part sideshow, part circus, part theme park, Coney Island set an example for amusement parks. Attractions that are so familiar today—roller coasters, water rides, fun houses, Tunnels of Love—all got their start there.\
 \
 (paragraph 10) Many amusement parks closed during the Great Depression in the 1930s or during World War II (1939–1945). Coney Island has had its ups and downs, too. Over the decades, fires and age destroyed some of the original attractions. In 2012, Superstorm Sandy wrecked the boardwalk and many of the attractions.\
 \
 (paragraph 11) In spite of all that, Coney Island has survived, and it is still operating today. It continues to offer each new generation of kids (and their parents) a chance to escape to a special world of entertainment and thrills. And from New Jersey’s Wildwood Park to California’s Pacific Park and Florida’s Walt Disney World, other amusement and theme parks have taken their cues from Coney Island. They have grown to epic proportions in their efforts to offer a world full of fun.\
Why was George Ferris’s wheel considered an “engineering marvel” (paragraph 4)?\
(A) It became the most popular attraction at the exposition.\
 (B) It was the fastest ride in the Midway section of the exposition.\
 (C) It gave people the opportunity to see the capabilities of new technology.\
 (D) It was something that other amusement park owners tried to bring to their parks.\

This story takes place in Japan. The narrator has just rented a new home on a small street named Lightning Alley.\
 \
 Excerpt from The Guest Cat\
 \
 by Takashi Hiraide\
 \
 (paragraph 1) The cat’s name was Chibi, which means “little one.” We could hear the boy’s particularly high-pitched voice calling the cat: “Chibi!” Then we’d hear the sound of the boy’s shoes running around outside, followed by the tinkling of the little bell announcing the cat’s arrival.\
 \
 (paragraph 2) Chibi was a jewel of a cat. Her pure white fur was mottled with several lampblack blotches containing just a bit of light brown. The sort of cat you might see just about anywhere in Japan, except she was especially slim and tiny.\
 \
 (paragraph 3) These were her individual characteristics—slim and small, with ears that stood out, tapering off beautifully at the tips, and often twitching. She would approach silently and undetected to rub up against one’s legs. At first I thought Chibi avoided me because I was not used to cats, but this seems not to have been the case. When a girl who often passed along Lightning Alley stopped and crouched to gaze at the cat, it did not run away. But as soon as she attempted to touch it, the cat quickly slipped off, avoiding contact at all costs. The cat’s manner of rejection was like cold, white light.\
 \
 (paragraph 4) Moreover, the cat rarely made a sound. As far as I remember, when it first appeared in the alley it made some sort of sound, but since then it had never let out a meow. It looked as if no matter how much time passed the cat was not going to let us hear its\
 voice. This seemed to be the message the cat was giving us.\
 \
 (paragraph 5) Another one of Chibi’s characteristics was that she changed the direction of her cautious attention frequently. This active behavior wasn’t limited to her kittenhood. Perhaps because she played alone most of the time in the expansive garden, she reacted strongly to insects and reptiles. And there were times when I could only conclude that she must be reacting to subtle changes in the wind and light, not detectable by humans. It may be that most cats share the same quickness, but even so, in Chibi’s case, it was acute—she was, after all, the cat of Lightning Alley. My wife got into the habit of pointing to the cat whenever it went by, extolling (extolling - praising) its virtues. . . .\
 \
 (paragraph 6) Chibi, who loved to play ball, gradually began to visit us on her own and would try and get us to play with her. She would step gingerly into the room and gaze intently at its occupants, then purposefully turn around and walk back out, as if to lead us to the garden. This process would be repeated until she got a response. Most of the time my wife would put down whatever she was doing, slip happily into her sandals and head outside.\
 \
 (paragraph 7) Having played to her heart’s content, Chibi would come inside and rest for a while. When she began to sleep on the sofa—like a talisman (talisman - an object thought to bring good luck) curled gently in the shape of a comma and dug up from a prehistoric archaeological site—a deep sense of happiness arrived, as if the house itself had dreamed this scene.\
 \
 (paragraph 8) Avoiding the prying eyes of the landlady, we began leaving it up to Chibi to come inside the house whenever she wanted—and with this new development I had begun little by little to understand cat lovers. Whether on TV or in all of the ubiquitous (ubiquitous - present everywhere) cat calendars, it seemed as if there was no cat comparable to her. But, though I had started to think of her as the best cat around, she was not really our cat.\
 \
 (paragraph 9) First we would hear the tinkling of the bell, and then she would appear, so we began to call her by the nickname “Tinkerbell.” Whenever we wanted her to come over, this name seemed to find itself on our lips.\
 \
 (paragraph 10) “I wonder where Tinkerbell is.” By the time my wife had gotten the words out of her mouth we’d hear the tinkling of Chibi’s bell. We’d realize that she was near at the point where, exiting the foyer next door (located at the second corner of Lightning Alley), Chibi would leap through the tear in the wire-mesh boundary of the property, dash along the side of the building, turn at the far end of the veranda, leap up onto the open area of the deck, and then, placing her front paws on the window frame at about the height of a human adult’s knee, stretch out her neck to peek inside.\
 \
 (paragraph 11) In winter she came inside. Little by little, through the crack in the partially opened window, her tendency to visit subtly developed; her appearances were repeated until, as if a silken opening in a fabric had been continuously moistened and stretched, Chibi had entered our lives. But at the same time—call it fate if you will—something else was closing in and pressing itself against that tendency.\
In paragraph 8, why does the narrator say he “had begun little by little to understand cat lovers”?\
(A) He realizes that most cats are probably like Chibi.\
 (B) He decides to buy a cat calendar to celebrate Chibi.\
 (C) He feels a sense of contentment when Chibi visits.\
 (D) He is in awe of the boy who runs around outside with Chibi.\

“Janet Guthrie: Lady in the Fast\
 Lane” from Profifiles in Sports Courage\
 by Ken Rappoport\
 \
 (paragraph 1) It was no surprise that Janet Guthrie excelled at one of the most dangerous sports on Earth. She had always loved adventure and daring new experiences.\
 (paragraph 2) Janet was born on March 7, 1938, in Iowa City, Iowa, and lived on a farm for the first few years of her life. Her father, an airline pilot, later moved the family to South Florida, where Janet took up flying.\
 (paragraph 3) At 13, she had already flown an airplane. At age 16, Janet decided she wanted to try a free-fall parachute jump. In free-fall, the parachutist jumps out of a plane without opening the chute. After falling several hundred feet at more than 100 miles an hour, the cord is pulled to open the chute. Then, if all goes well, the parachutist floats safely to the ground.\
 (paragraph 4) Her father wouldn’t hear of it. “Absolutely not,” he said. “No free-fall!”\
 (paragraph 5) But Janet persisted. Finally, her father gave in. “Just one time,” he said, “but you have to be careful and do it the right way.”\
 (paragraph 6) He would allow her to jump only on two conditions: He would fly the plane and she would receive parachuting lessons before the jump.\
 (paragraph 7) Since there were no parachuting schools in South Florida at the time, Janet’s father hired a pro to give her private lessons. In her autobiography, Janet Guthrie—A Life at Full Throttle, Janet said the pro taught her how to pull the rip cord that opened the chute, how to absorb the shock after landing, and how to fasten the helmet so it wouldn’t fly off.\
 ♦ ♦ ♦\
 (paragraph 8) By the time she was 21, she had earned a commercial pilot’s license. She flew whenever she could break away from her classes at the University of Michigan.\
 (paragraph 9) After graduating, Guthrie got a job as a physicist in the aerospace industry. She saved her money for an entire year and bought a car. Guthrie wasn’t satisfied with just any car. She chose a Jaguar XK 120—the sleek and popular sports car that she had dreamed about since she was a teenager.\
 aerospace = a business involved with space flight\
 (paragraph 10) At first, Guthrie enjoyed just driving the car around Long Island, outside New York City. Then she heard about a local sports car club where members could compete. She loved her car and wanted to see how it would do on a track. Soon she was entering races—and winning them.\
 (paragraph 11) Excited by her success, Guthrie attended a driving school in Connecticut. She was a natural. Her instructor, veteran driver Gordon McKenzie, liked the way she handled her car. He suggested she try auto racing.\
 (paragraph 12) A thrill shot through Guthrie. What a great idea. Off she went to enroll in a racing car drivers’ school sponsored by the Sports Car Club of America. Guthrie swapped her Jaguar for a higher-priced model built especially for racing—the XK 140. Before long she taught herself how to take apart and rebuild its engine like a pro.\
 ♦ ♦ ♦\
 (paragraph 13) Guthrie’s career started to pick up speed.\
 (paragraph 14) She entered races all over the United States, finishing in some of the country’s most celebrated long-distance competitions. In 1973, she won the North Atlantic Road Racing Championship. A champion, yes, but a tired champion. By then she had been racing for 13 years. She was exhausted, broke, and thinking of leaving the sport.\
 (paragraph 15) That’s when she got the phone call. Someone named Vollstedt was asking her to drive his car in the 1976 Indy 500. No woman had ever driven in that race. This has to be a prank, thought Guthrie. But Vollstedt, an auto designer and builder from Oregon, wasn’t kidding. Could she drive a “championship” car? That was the big question.\
 (paragraph 16) With their open cockpits, wide wheelbases, and rear engines, championship cars were much different than the closed sports cars Guthrie had been accustomed to driving for many years.\
 (paragraph 17) “Before she would agree to drive for me,” Vollstedt said, “she wanted to see if she could handle the car.”\
 (paragraph 18) Vollstedt was wondering the same thing, too. He arranged for a secret test at the Ontario Motor Speedway near Los Angeles.\
 (paragraph 19) To get into top physical shape for Vollstedt’s test, Guthrie did exercises in front of her TV. One day she lost her balance, landed hard on her left foot, and fell to the floor. The doctors told her she had broken a bone and they put her foot in a heavy cast. How am I going to drive a racing car? she worried. Will I miss my big chance?\
 ♦ ♦ ♦\
 (paragraph 20) Broken ankle and all, Guthrie stepped into an unfamiliar car. She hit the accelerator. When her car got up to speed, Guthrie couldn’t believe the feeling. “What a thrill,” she said. “It was like going to the moon.”\
 (paragraph 21) Vollstedt was impressed with her time—an average speed of 178.52 miles per hour and a top speed of 196 mph.\
 (paragraph 22) Test passed.\
 (paragraph 23) She had showed Vollstedt she could drive the car. Now she had to show the rest of the world.\
Which detail from the article represents Guthrie’s biggest challenge?\
(A) “Before long she taught herself how to take apart and rebuild its engine . . .” (paragraph 12)\
 (B) “. . . finishing in some of the country’s most celebrated long-distance competitions.” (paragraph 14)\
 (C) “. . . a secret test at the Ontario Motor Speedway near Los Angeles.” (paragraph 18)\

Barley Gene Lowers Emissions From Rice\
 Over half the people on the planet eat rice as a staple food. Growing rice emits methane, a potent greenhouse gas—to the tune of 25 million to 100 million tons of methane every year, a notable contribution to human-caused greenhouse gas emissions…\
 …When rice paddies are flooded, methane-producing bacteria thrive on the carbohydrates secreted by rice roots in the oxygen-free soils. The rice plant itself acts as a conduit [pathway], transmitting methane from the soil into the atmosphere…\
 Source: Times Tribune 7/23/15\
 \
 Scientists have incorporated a barley gene into a type of rice and produced rice plants that have much lower methane emissions. It is most likely that the scientists incorporated the barley gene into the rice, producing a new variety, using the process of\
(1) selective breeding\
 (2) meiosis, followed by recombination\
 (3) genetic engineering\
 (4) sexual reproduction, followed by mitosis\

Reading Comprehension Passage A\
 \
 Screeno\
 In the following passage, Cornelius Schmidt seeks refuge from a gloomy, rainy night by going to a movie. \
 \
 …At the door [of the theater] the uniformed ticket taker gave him a card on which was \
 printed a kind of checkerboard, having in each box a number. It was obviously the old game \
 of Lotto, the object being to get five numbers which were successive either horizontally or\
 vertically or in a diagonal. In the center, amid numbered boxes, was a box entitled\
 (line 5) GRATIS; (GRATIS - free, a space that could count as any number called) the management gave this box to the audience. …\
    The theatre fell into a semi-darkness, not the movie darkness, but one in which discreet\
 lights shone on both sides of the theatre and both sides of the stage. A white and pink\
 clockface flashed on the screen. It was, in fact, like a roulette wheel, and had numbers\
 running from 1 to 100. In the center was a pointer, which suddenly began to whirl furiously \
 (line 10) about the clockface, and then slowed down, and then stopped.\
    \"Ninety-nine!\" said the businesslike yet airy young man in an authoritative voice.\
 An usher wrote down the number upon a blackboard to the right of the screen. The pointer \
 spun again, at a tremendous pace, so that it was almost a moving blur for a moment, and\
 then clarified into its arrow-like straightness. The actual wheel was, of course, in the\
 (line 15) projection room.\
    \"Fifty-four!\" said the young master of ceremonies, simulating a dramatic tone.\
    \"SCREENO!\" cried a voice from the balcony in a mocking voice, while everyone\
 laughed, for obviously no one could have SCREENO as yet.\
    \"I am sorry, ladies and gentlemen,\" said the young man in an affable (affable - friendly) voice,\" but we will \
 (line 20) have to ask you not to be humorous about this. After all, money is involved, and there has\
 been much confusion in the past because various people insisted upon trying to be\
 funny.\"…\
    The pointer was revolving again. \"Thirty-nine!\" announced the young man. The\
 audience was not yet warmed up, because too few numbers had been called for anyone to \
 (line 25) be on the verge of winning. Cornelius, however, also had this third number and was pleased \
 no little by the course of events.\
    \"Forty-nine!\" announced the young man. …\
    \"Fourteen!\" cried the young man into the microphone which made his voice even more\
 official than otherwise. Cornelius did not have the number. He assured himself that the\
 (line 30) game was a fraud, that the management was obviously not going to permit anyone to win so \
 much money and that the whole business would obviously be controlled in the projection \
 room or by arranging the numbers on the cards. There was only one more chance, a drop\
 in the ocean. He slouched back in his seat, chiding himself for his great excitement. …\
    \"Twenty-five!\" the master of ceremonies called out.\
 (line 35)    \"Twenty-five! Twenty-five!\" said Cornelius to himself, and then, finding the number on\
 his card as the fifth consecutive horizontal number, he rose in his seat and shouted:\
    \"SCREENO!\" in a too loud voice which broke, and began to issue (to issue - to exit) from his aisle,\
 tripping over the feet of the people seated near him, some of whom were solicitous (solicitous - helpful) of his\
 walk, and eager to provide good advice as he passed. The attractiveness of the winner shone\
 (line 40) in him. …\
    An usher took his card, and checked it with the numbers on the blackboard. The young\
 man came over to oversee the usher. It seemed as if something was wrong, someone\
 had miscalculated, to look at the young man. The checking was done several times.\
 Very bureaucratic, said Cornelius to himself. Recovering, as the checkup proved that\
 (line 45) Cornelius had indeed won, he shook Cornelius’s hand and the whole theatre lighted up.\
    \"Lucky fellow,\" cried the balcony voice, amusing the audience again, by the envious\
 tone in his voice. …\
    The usher arrived with the money just as the persistent balcony voice called out,\
 \"Let’s go on with the show,\" and the audience began to clap again, wishing to have its\
 (line 50) chance at the other prizes.\
    But then, as the money was delivered to the young assistant manager, and he began\
 officiously to count it out, shuffle it, and arrange it, before paying Cornelius, a hoarse and \
 disused voice cried from the balcony:\
    \"SCREENO! SCREENO!\" …\
 (line 55)   \"SCREENO!\" came the voice again, this time nearer, as the new winner approached\
 the stairs from the balcony to the orchestra. The young assistant manager and the ushers \
 looked at each other in dismay. Something had obviously gone wrong, for usually no one\
 won the jackpot; two winners was inconceivable and would lead to bankruptcy. Someone\
 was going to lose his job because of this. …\
 (line 60)   \"My name is Casper Weingarten,\" said the old man, unasked, intruding himself upon\
 the huddle of the assistant manager and the ushers. He was very nervous, very excited.\
 \"I am a musician,\" he said, but no one paid any attention to him, except Cornelius.\
    And then the young assistant manager came over to the old man and, holding the card\
 up, showed him that he had not won, that he had mistaken a 7 for a 1 because the print had\
 (line 65) been on the left-hand side. \"Perhaps you’ll win one of the other prizes,\" he said,\
 courteously, \"since you already have four numbers in a row.\" …\
    Cornelius came over to look into the matter for himself. He took the card in his hand\
 and looked at the number in question. The old man looked at him, and then turned to the\
 assistant manager, saying:\
 (line 70)   \"Give me my money! I have won!\" …\
    \"Look here,\" said Cornelius tactfully to the assistant manager, \"it seems to me that you\
 can only assume that this is a 1. The blur is too faint to make it a seven.\"\
    \"I know it is a 7,\" said the assistant manager angrily, and when he said that, Cornelius\
 recognized immediately that he was so sure because the cards had been prepared in\
 (line 75) advance to obviate the possibility of two winners of the jackpot, or even one. Seeing this,\
 Cornelius began to feel sick and angry, as he always did when confronted with fraud or\
 cheating.\
    \"All my life I’ve been cheated,\" said the old man, wringing his hands. \"Give me my\
 money.\" An usher took his arm, as if to lead him from the stage, but the assistant manager\
 (line 80) deterred him, unwilling as yet to resort to force. …\
    \"My good man,\" said the assistant manager, \"Your hard luck is not my fault, nor this\
 theatre’s responsibility. Please do not cause a disturbance. Now if both of you will leave the\
 stage, we can go on with the other prizes and with the show.\"\
    In answer, the old man sat down upon the stage, looking grotesque there, with his head\
 (line 85) turned up. \"I will sit here until I am paid,\" he said tearfully. …\
    But the audience was won over, for no one wished to lose his chance at the remaining\
 $50. There was a murmuring of voices and someone cried out:\
    \"Go home and give us a chance.\" …\
    \"Call a cop,\" said another. …\
 (line 90)   Cornelius meditated with himself for a moment and then said: \"Listen, I will give you\
 half of the jackpot. Come on before you’re arrested.\" …\
    \"No,\" said Weingarten, \"I don’t want your money. I want mine. Give me my money,\"\
 he said towards the assistant manager.\
    Cornelius considered matters with himself again and came to a decision. Easy come,\
 (line 95) easy go, he said to himself, and then he told the old musician that he could have the whole\
 jackpot. The manager protested immediately, but Cornelius took the bills from his pocket\
 and began to count them out and give them to the musician, who accepted them with\
 a guilty look and trembling hands.\
    The audience saw what was happening and applauded vigorously, not because it was\
 (line 100) genuinely moved, but because it felt that it ought to applaud. Such applause is heard at\
 public gatherings when an abstraction too vacuous (vacuous - insincere) is mentioned or tribute is paid to a man\
 long dead. The assistant manager, trying to move in on Cornelius’s credit, came over to\
 shake hands with Cornelius. Cornelius, tempted to reject the proffered hand, accepted it\
 because he wished to cause no further disturbance.\
 (line 105)   The old man had risen and come over to Cornelius.\
    \"Thank you very much for your kindness,\" he said in the estranged voice of those who\
 have been weeping or overexcited.\
    \"Not at all,\" said Cornelius formally. Both descended from the stage together. …\

 \
 This is the true story of a Kenyan woman named Wangari Maathai.\
 Excerpt from Seeds of Change:\
 Planting a Path to Peace\
 by Jen Cullerton Johnson\
 \
 (paragraph 1) “Come,” Wangari’s mother called. She beckoned her young daughter over to a tall tree with a wide, smooth trunk and a crown of green, oval leaves.\
 \
 (paragraph 2) “Feel,” her mother whispered.\
 \
 (paragraph 3) Wangari spread her small hands over the tree’s trunk. She smoothed her fingers over the rough bark.\
 \
 (paragraph 4) “This is the mugumo,” her mother said. “It is home to many. It feeds many too.”\
 \
 (paragraph 5) She snapped off a wild fig from a low branch, and gave it to her daughter. Wangari ate the delicious fruit, just as geckos and elephants did. High in the tree, birds chirped in their nests. The branches bounced with jumping monkeys.\
 \
 (paragraph 6) “Our people, the Kikuyu of Kenya, believe that our ancestors rest in the tree’s shade,” her mother explained.\
 \
 (paragraph 7) Wangari wrapped her arms around the trunk as if hugging her great-grandmother’s spirit. She promised never to cut down the tree. . . .\
 \
 ((paragraph 8) When Wangari finished elementary school, she was eleven years old. Her mind was like a seed rooted in rich soil, ready to grow. Wangari wanted to continue her education, but to do so she would have to leave her village and move to the capital city of Nairobi. Wangari had never been farther than her valley’s ridge. She was scared.\
 \
 (paragraph 9) “Go,” her mother said. She picked up a handful of earth and placed it gently into her daughter’s hand. “Where you go, we go.” . . .\
 \
 (paragraph 10) As graduation neared, Wangari told her friends she wanted to become a biologist.\
 \
 (paragraph 11) “Not many native women become biologists,” they told her.\
 \
 (paragraph 12) “I will,” she said.\
 \
 (paragraph 13) Wangari watched sadly as her government sold more and more land to big companies that cut down forests for timber and to clear land for coffee plantations. Native trees such as cedar and acacia vanished. Without trees, birds had no place to nest. Monkeys lost their swings. Tired mothers walked miles for firewood. . . .\
 \
 (paragraph 14) When Wangari visited her village she saw that the Kikuyu custom of not chopping down the mugumo trees had been lost. No longer held in place by tree roots, the soil streamed into the rivers. The water that had been used to grow maize, bananas, and sweet potatoes turned to mud and dried up. Many families went hungry.\
 \
 (paragraph 15) Wangari could not bear to think of the land being destroyed. Now married and the mother of three children, she worried about what would happen to the mothers and children who depended on the land.\
 \
 (paragraph 16) “We must do something,” Wangari said.\
 \
 (paragraph 17) Wangari had an idea as small as a seed but as tall as a tree that reaches for the sky. “Harabee! Let’s work together!” she said to her countrywomen—mothers like her. Wangari dug deep into the soil, a seedling by her side. “We must plant trees.” . . .\
 \
 (paragraph 18) Wangari traveled to villages, towns, and cities with saplings and seeds, shovels and hoes. At each place she went, women planted rows of trees that looked like green belts across the land. Because of this they started calling themselves the Green Belt Movement.\
 \
 (paragraph 19) “We might not change the big world but we can change the landscape of the forest,” she said.\
 \
 (paragraph 20) One tree turned to ten, ten to one hundred, one hundred to one million, all the way up to thirty million planted trees. Kenya grew green again. Birds nested in new trees. Monkeys swung on branches. Rivers filled with clean water. Wild figs grew heavy in mugumo branches.\
 \
 (paragraph 21) Mothers fed their children maize, bananas, and sweet potatoes until they could eat no more.\
What idea is developed in paragraphs 4 through 7?\
(A) Wangari and her mother want to plant more trees.\
 (B) Mugumo trees are important to people and animals.\
 (C) Mugumo trees can provide shade to many people.\
 (D) Wangari and her mother think education is important.\

 assemble in conference to appraise the perils that have arisen as a result of the development\
 of weapons of mass destruction, and to discuss a resolution in the spirit of the appended\
 draft.\
 \
 (line 5) We are speaking on this occasion, not as members of this or that nation, continent, or\
 creed, but as human beings, members of the species Man, whose continued existence is in\
 doubt. The world is full of conflicts; and, overshadowing all minor conflicts, the titanic\
 struggle between Communism and anti-Communism. …\
 \
 We have to learn to think in a new way. We have to learn to ask ourselves, not what steps\
 (line 10) can be taken to give military victory to whatever group we prefer, for there no longer are\
 such steps; the question we have to ask ourselves is: what steps can be taken to prevent a\
 military contest of which the issue must be disastrous to all parties? …\
 \
 No doubt in an H-bomb (H-bomb — hydrogen bomb) war great cities would be obliterated. But this is one of the\
 minor disasters that would have to be faced. If everybody in London, New York, and\
 (line 15) Moscow were exterminated, the world might, in the course of a few centuries, recover from\
 the blow. But we now know, especially since the Bikini test, (Bikini test — reference to an American test of a hydrogen bomb conducted at the Bikini Atoll in the Pacific Ocean on March 1st, 1954. The bomb sent radioactive debris across the globe) that nuclear bombs can\
 gradually spread destruction over a very much wider area than had been supposed. …\
 \
 Many warnings have been uttered by eminent men of science and by authorities in\
 military strategy. None of them will say that the worst results are certain. What they do say\
 (line 20) is that these results are possible, and no one can be sure that they will not be realized. We\
 have not yet found that the views of experts on this question depend in any degree upon\
 their politics or prejudices. They depend only, so far as our researches have revealed, upon\
 the extent of the particular expert’s knowledge. We have found that the men who know most\
 are the most gloomy.\
 \
 (line 25) Here, then, is the problem which we present to you, stark and dreadful and inescapable:\
 Shall we put an end to the human race; or shall mankind renounce war? People will not face\
 this alternative because it is so difficult to abolish war.\
 \
 The abolition of war will demand distasteful limitations of national sovereignty. But\
 what perhaps impedes understanding of the situation more than anything else is that the\
 (line 30) term “mankind” feels vague and abstract. People scarcely realize in imagination that the\
 danger is to themselves and their children and their grandchildren, and not only to a dimly\
 apprehended humanity. They can scarcely bring themselves to grasp that they, individually,\
 and those whom they love are in imminent (imminent — about to take place) danger of perishing agonizingly. And so they\
 hope that perhaps war may be allowed to continue provided modern weapons are\
 (line 35) prohibited.\
 \
 This hope is illusory. Whatever agreements not to use H-bombs had been reached in\
 time of peace, they would no longer be considered binding in time of war, and both sides\
 would set to work to manufacture H-bombs as soon as war broke out, for, if one side\
 manufactured the bombs and the other did not, the side that manufactured them would\
 (line 40) inevitably be victorious.\
 \
 Although an agreement to renounce nuclear weapons as part of a general reduction of\
 armaments would not afford an ultimate solution, it would serve certain important purposes.\
 First: any agreement between East and West is to the good in so far as it tends to diminish\
 tension. Second: the abolition of thermo-nuclear weapons, if each side believed that the\
 (line 45) other had carried it out sincerely, would lessen the fear of a sudden attack in the style of\
 Pearl Harbour, which at present keeps both sides in a state of nervous apprehension. We\
 should, therefore, welcome such an agreement, though only as a first step.\
 \
 Most of us are not neutral in feeling, but, as human beings, we have to remember that,\
 if the issues between East and West are to be decided in any manner that can give any\
 (line 50) possible satisfaction to anybody, whether Communist or anti-Communist, whether Asian or\
 European or American, whether White or Black, then these issues must not be decided by\
 war. We should wish this to be understood, both in the East and in the West.\
 \
 There lies before us, if we choose, continual progress in happiness, knowledge, and\
 wisdom. Shall we, instead, choose death, because we cannot forget our quarrels? We\
 (line 55) appeal, as human beings, to human beings: Remember your humanity, and forget the rest.\
 If you can do so, the way lies open to a new Paradise; if you cannot, there lies before you\
 the risk of universal death.\
 \
 Resolution\
 \
 We invite this Congress, (Congress — the group of scientists who signed the Manifesto) and through it the scientists of the world and the general\
 public, to subscribe to the following resolution:\
 \
 (line 60) “In view of the fact that in any future world war nuclear weapons will certainly be\
 employed, and that such weapons threaten the continued existence of mankind, we urge\
 the Governments of the world to realize, and to acknowledge publicly, that their\
 purpose cannot be furthered by a world war, and we urge them, consequently, to find\
 peaceful means for the settlement of all matters of dispute between them.”\
 \
 —Bertrand Russell\
 excerpted from “The Russell–Einstein Manifesto”\
 July 9, 1955\
Lines 41 through 47 suggest that a potential agreement on weaponry would be\
(1) successful\
 (2) controversial\
 (3) unpopular\
 (4) helpful\

Excerpt from The Call of Coney Island\
 \
 by Cynthia Overbeck Bix\
 \
 (paragraph 1) Salty ocean smells mingle with the aromas of sweet cotton candy and Nathan’s Famous hot dogs. The legendary Cyclone roller coaster lurches along its tracks—then takes a heart-stopping plunge. Riders whoop and scream with excitement. Farther down the boardwalk, the sound of a carousel starts. Patrons pitch balls at moving targets, hoping to win a prize. Welcome to Coney Island, the nation’s first truly modern amusement area.\
 \
 (paragraph 2) Located on the southern tip of Brooklyn, New York, Coney Island has been the place to go for fun for more than a century. The inspiration for amusement parks such as Coney Island sprang from an exciting event in 1893—the World’s Columbian Exposition in Chicago. It was one of the first venues where people experienced a variety of attractions in one large space. \
 \
 (paragraph 3) Visitors to Chicago gasped in wonder when they saw the fair’s “White City” spread out before them. Beautiful all-white exhibition buildings and large classical statues framed a lagoon of shimmering water. Designed to educate and inform, about a dozen grand buildings housed displays on the latest developments in transportation, machinery, agriculture, art, horticulture, and more. Most visitors had never seen the things they saw there, such as electric lights, a moving sidewalk, world-famous artwork, and moving pictures.\
 \
 (paragraph 4) While the World’s Columbian Exposition awed people with new innovations and ideas, its most popular attraction was the Midway Plaisance. Located in a separate section of the exhibition grounds, the Midway was filled with entertainment: rides, food stands, and sideshows. People could get a taste of international cultures, for example, by riding a camel through the Streets of Cairo or strolling among the thatched huts of a South Sea village. Best of all, they could ride George Ferris’s giant spinning wheel. Rising 264 feet above the Midway, this engineering marvel became the star of the fair. It was a spectacular example of what the new age of machines made possible.\
 \
 (paragraph 5) One visitor, New York showman George C. Tilyou, immediately saw potential for this new form of entertainment. Tilyou owned property on Coney Island, which already was an established beach resort with hotels, bathhouses, and restaurants. It also featured an odd collection of sideshows, food vendors, fortunetellers, and more. Tilyou decided to build an enclosed amusement park there.\
 \
 (paragraph 6) In 1897, Tilyou opened Steeplechase Park. When he was unable to buy Ferris’s wheel, he had his own version built. For 25 cents, visitors could ride Tilyou’s wheel, enjoy the Scenic Railway, or climb into a “spaceship” for a Trip to the Moon. On the Steeplechase, wooden horses carried riders along a metal racetrack from a starting gate to a finish line.\
 \
 (paragraph 7) Steeplechase Park’s huge success was partly due to another invention—electric railways. The first electric trolley line had connected Manhattan Island and Coney Island in the mid-1800s. By the turn of the 20th century, an electric train offered an even faster way to carry more people wanting to escape from the hot, crowded city.\
 \
 (paragraph 8) In the late 1800s and early 1900s, most people worked long hours and six days a week in urban factories and shops. But for a nickel fare, a city worker could afford a day’s outing to a nearby park on Sundays. Recognizing the value of giving the working class access to day trips, trolley and train companies established parks that were located at the end of a line. Travelers disembarked to enjoy simple outdoor pleasures in picnic groves and swimming pools or beaches. Eventually, merry-go-rounds, penny arcades, (penny arcades - indoor area with amusements such as games and photo booths operated by placing a coin in a slot) and even small roller coasters were added. . . .\
 \
 (paragraph 9) Part sideshow, part circus, part theme park, Coney Island set an example for amusement parks. Attractions that are so familiar today—roller coasters, water rides, fun houses, Tunnels of Love—all got their start there.\
 \
 (paragraph 10) Many amusement parks closed during the Great Depression in the 1930s or during World War II (1939–1945). Coney Island has had its ups and downs, too. Over the decades, fires and age destroyed some of the original attractions. In 2012, Superstorm Sandy wrecked the boardwalk and many of the attractions.\
 \
 (paragraph 11) In spite of all that, Coney Island has survived, and it is still operating today. It continues to offer each new generation of kids (and their parents) a chance to escape to a special world of entertainment and thrills. And from New Jersey’s Wildwood Park to California’s Pacific Park and Florida’s Walt Disney World, other amusement and theme parks have taken their cues from Coney Island. They have grown to epic proportions in their efforts to offer a world full of fun.\
In paragraph 1, what does the phrase “lurches along its tracks—then takes a heart-stopping plunge” suggest about the Cyclone roller coaster?\
(A) It moves at an unexpected rate of speed.\
 (B) It provides a thrilling experience for riders.\
 (C) It appeals to some visitors but not others.\
 (D) It presents a safety hazard for riders.\

 Amazement Awaits\
 \
 Written on the occasion of the 2008 Olympics at the request of the Olympic Committee\
 \
 Sheer amazement awaits\
 Amazement luxuriant in promise\
 Abundant in wonder\
 Our beautiful children arrive at this Universal stadium.\
 \
 (line 5) They have bathed in the waters of the world\
 And carry the soft silt of the Amazon, the Nile,\
 The Danube, the Rhine, the Yangtze and the Mississippi\
 In the palms of their right hands.\
 A wild tiger nestles in each armpit\
 (line 10) And a meadowlark perches on each shoulder.\
 \
 We, the world audience, stand, arms akimbo, (akimbo — with hands on hips and elbows turned outward)\
 Longing for the passion of the animal:\
 The melody of the lark\
 And the tigers’ passion\
 (line 15) Attend the opening bells,\
 The birds sing of the amazement which awaits\
 \
 The miracle of joy that comes out of the gathering of our best,\
 bringing their best,\
 Displaying the splendor of their bodies and the radiance of their\
 (line 20) agile minds to the cosmos.\
 \
 Encouragement to those other youth caught in the maws (maws — jaws) of poverty,\
 Crippled by the terror of ignorance.\
 \
 They say,\
 Brothers and Sisters,\
 (line 25) Yes, try.\
 Then try harder.\
 Lunge forward, press eagerly for release.\
 The amazement which awaits is for you.\
 \
 We are here at the portal of the world we had wished for\
 (line 30) At the lintel (lintel — a horizontal support above a door or window) of the world we most need.\
 We are here roaring and singing.\
 We prove that we can not only make peace, we can bring it with us.\
 \
 With respect for the world and its people,\
 We can compete passionately without hatred.\
 (line 35) With respect for the world and its people,\
 We can take pride in the achievement of strangers.\
 With respect for the world and its people,\
 We can share openly in the success of friends.\
 \
 Here then is the Amazement:\
 (line 40) Against the odds of impending war,\
 In the mouth of bloody greed,\
 Human grace and human spirit can still conquer.\
 \
 Ah…\
 We discover, we ourselves\
 (line 45) Are the Amazement which awaits\
 We are ourselves Amazement.\

 . . . Climate change is not equally felt across the globe, and neither are its longer term consequences. . . . Climate change is a threat multiplier: It contributes to economic and political instability and also worsens the effects. It propels sudden onset disasters like floods and storms and slow-onset disasters like drought and desertification; those disasters contribute to failed crops, famine and overcrowded urban centers; those crises inflame political unrest and worsen the impacts of war, which leads to even more displacement. There is no internationally recognized legal definition for “environmental migrants” or “climate refugees,” so there is no formal reckoning of how many have left their homes because climate change has made their lives or livelihoods untenable [unsustainable]. In a 2010 Gallup World Poll, though, about 12 percent of respondents — representing a total of 500 million adults — said severe environmental problems would require them to move within the next five years. . . .\

 …Equally important to English agriculture was the development of new ways of raising crops and animals. About the same time that Townshend was experimenting with turnips and clover, an English farmer, Jethro Tull, introduced a new way of planting seed. In the past, farmers had scattered seed over the surface of a plowed field. Much of this seed was eaten by birds or did not take root.\
    Tull instead proposed planting each seed deeply into the ground and then hoeing around it. The result was a heavy crop yield because more seeds survived and flourished. Tull increased the efficiency of this process by doing the planting with horse-drawn seed drills and hoes.…\
    This agrarian revolution, as it has been called, was every bit as important as the industrial revolution. The availability of good food, combined with improved infant survival and the disappearance of epidemics, helped more young live to adulthood and allowed adults to live longer. This meant that, by the middle of the eighteenth century, more people were having more children, and the population grew quickly thereafter.…\

Reading Comprehension Passage A\
 \
 The factory made the best centrifugal pumps in the world, and Merle Waggoner owned\
 it. He’d started it. He’d just been offered two million dollars for it by the General Forge and\
 Foundry Company. He didn’t have any stockholders and he didn’t owe a dime. He was\
 fifty-one, a widower, and he had one heir—a son. The boy’s name was Franklin. The boy\
 (line 5) was named after Benjamin Franklin.\
 \
 One Friday afternoon father and son came out of Merle’s office and into the factory.\
 They went down a factory aisle to Rudy Linberg’s lathe. (lathe — a machine on which a piece of material, such as wood or metal, is spun and shaped against a fixed\
 cutting tool)\
 \
 “Rudy,” said Merle, “the boy here’s home from college for three days, and I thought\
 maybe you and him and your boy and me might go out to the farm and shoot some clay\
 (line 10) pigeons tomorrow.”\
 \
 Rudy turned his sky-blue eyes to Merle and young Franklin. He was Merle’s age, and\
 he had the deep and narrow dignity of a man who had learned his limitations early—who\
 had never tried to go beyond them. His limitations were those of his tools, his flute and his\
 shotgun. …\
 \
 (line 15) “Let’s go ask my boy what he’s got on tomorrow,” said Rudy. It was a formality. Karl\
 always did what his father wanted him to do—did it with profound love. …\
 \
 Karl was a carbon copy of his father. He was such a good mimic of Rudy that his joints\
 seemed to ache a little with age. He seemed sobered by fifty-one years of life, though he’d\
 lived only twenty. He seemed instinctively wary of safety hazards that had been eliminated\
 (line 20) from the factory by the time he’d learned to walk. Karl stood at attention without humility,\
 just as his father had done.\
 \
 “Want to go shooting tomorrow?” said Rudy.\
 “Shoot what?” said Karl.\
 “Crows. Clay pigeons,” said Rudy. “Maybe a woodchuck.”\
 \
 (line 25)“Don’t mind,” said Karl. He nodded briefly to Merle and Franklin. “Glad to.” …\
 Rudy nodded. He examined the work in Karl’s lathe and tapped his own temple. The\
 tapping was a signal that Franklin had seen many times on hunts. It meant that Karl was\
 doing fine.\
 \
 Rudy touched Karl’s elbow lightly. It was the signal for Karl to get back to work. Rudy\
 (line 30) and Karl each held up a crooked finger and saluted with it. Franklin knew what that meant\
 too. It meant, “Good-by, I love you.” …\
 \
 Merle was sitting at his desk, his head down, when Franklin came in. He held a steel\
 plate about six inches square in his left hand. In the middle of the plate was a hole two inches\
 square. In his right hand he held a steel cube that fitted the hole exactly. …\
 \
 (line 35) Franklin sat down gingerly on a hard chair by the wall. The office hadn’t changed much\
 in the years he’d known it. It was one more factory room, with naked pipes overhead—the\
 cold ones sweaty, the hot ones dry. Wires snaked from steel box to steel box. The green walls\
 and cream trim were as rough as elephant hide in some places, with alternating coats of\
 paint and grime, paint and grime.\
 \
 (line 40) There had never been time to scrape away the layers, and barely enough time,\
 overnight, to slap on new paint. And there had never been time in which to finish the rough\
 shelves that lined the room. …\
 \
 Merle slipped the cube through the square hole once more. “Know what these are?” he\
 said.\
 \
 (line 45) “Yes, sir,” said Franklin. “They’re what Rudy Linberg had to make when he was an\
 apprentice in Sweden.”\
 The cube could be slipped through the hole in twenty-four different ways, without\
 letting the tiniest ray of light pass through with it.\
 \
 “Unbelievable skill,” said Franklin respectfully. “There aren’t craftsmen like that\
 (line 50) coming along any more.” He didn’t really feel much respect. He was simply saying what he\
 knew his father wanted to hear. The cube and the hole struck him as criminal wastes of time\
 and great bores. “Unbelievable,” he said again.\
 \
 “It’s utterly unbelievable, when you realize that Rudy didn’t make them,” said Merle\
 gravely, “when you realize what generation the man who made them belongs to.”\
 \
 (line 55) “Oh?” said Franklin. “Who did make them?”\
 \
 “Rudy’s boy, Karl,” said Merle. “A member of your generation.” He ground out his cigar\
 sadly. “He gave them to me on my last birthday. They were on my desk, boy, waiting for me\
 when I came in—right beside the ones Rudy gave me thirty-one years before.” …\
 \
 “I could have cried, boy, when I saw those two plates and those two cubes side by side,”\
 (line 60) said Merle. “Can you understand that?” he asked beseechingly. “Can you understand why\
 I’d feel like crying?” …\
 \
 “The cube of Karl’s fitted through the hole of Rudy’s!” said Merle. “They were\
 interchangeable!”\
 \
 “Gosh!” said Franklin. “I’ll be darned. Really?”\
 \
 (line 65) And now he felt like crying, because he didn’t care, couldn’t care—and would have\
 given his right arm to care. The factory whanged and banged and screeched in monstrous\
 irrelevance—Franklin’s, all Franklin’s, if he just said the word.\
 \
 “What’ll you do with it—buy a theater in New York?” said Merle abruptly.\
 \
 “Do with what, sir?” said Franklin.\
 \
 (line 70) “The money I’ll get for the factory when I sell it—the money I’ll leave to you when I’m\
 dead,” said Merle. He hit the word “dead” hard. “What’s Waggoner Pump going to be\
 converted into? Waggoner Theaters? Waggoner School of Acting? The Waggoner Home for\
 Broken-Down Actors?”\
 \
 “I—I hadn’t thought about it,” said Franklin. The idea of converting Waggoner Pump\
 (line 75) into something equally complicated hadn’t occurred to him, and appalled him now. He was\
 being asked to match his father’s passion for the factory with an equal passion for something\
 else. And Franklin had no such passion—for the theater or anything else. …\
 \
 “Don’t sell on my account,” said Franklin wretchedly.\
 \
 “On whose account would I keep it?” said Merle.\
 \
 (line 80) “Do you have to sell it today?” said Franklin, horrified.\
 \
 “Strike while the iron’s hot, I always say,” said Merle. “Today’s the day you decided to\
 be an actor, and, as luck would have it, we have an excellent offer for what I did with my\
 life.”\
 \
 “Couldn’t we wait?”\
 \
 (line 85) “For what?” said Merle. He was having a good time now.\
 \
 “Father!” cried Franklin. “For the love of heaven, father, please!” He hung his head and\
 shook it. “I don’t know what I’m doing,” he said brokenly. “I don’t know for sure what I want\
 to do yet. I’m just playing with ideas, trying to find myself. Please, father, don’t sell what\
 you’ve done with your life, don’t just throw it away because I’m not sure I want to do that\
 (line 90) with my life too! Please!” Franklin looked up. “I’m not Karl Linberg,” he said. “I can’t help\
 it. I’m sorry, but I’m not Karl Linberg.” …\

Reading Comprehension Passage B\
 \
 Amazement Awaits\
 \
 Written on the occasion of the 2008 Olympics at the request of the Olympic Committee\
 \
 Sheer amazement awaits\
 Amazement luxuriant in promise\
 Abundant in wonder\
 Our beautiful children arrive at this Universal stadium.\
 \
 (line 5) They have bathed in the waters of the world\
 And carry the soft silt of the Amazon, the Nile,\
 The Danube, the Rhine, the Yangtze and the Mississippi\
 In the palms of their right hands.\
 A wild tiger nestles in each armpit\
 (line 10) And a meadowlark perches on each shoulder.\
 \
 We, the world audience, stand, arms akimbo, (akimbo — with hands on hips and elbows turned outward)\
 Longing for the passion of the animal:\
 The melody of the lark\
 And the tigers’ passion\
 (line 15) Attend the opening bells,\
 The birds sing of the amazement which awaits\
 \
 The miracle of joy that comes out of the gathering of our best,\
 bringing their best,\
 Displaying the splendor of their bodies and the radiance of their\
 (line 20) agile minds to the cosmos.\
 \
 Encouragement to those other youth caught in the maws (maws — jaws) of poverty,\
 Crippled by the terror of ignorance.\
 \
 They say,\
 Brothers and Sisters,\
 (line 25) Yes, try.\
 Then try harder.\
 Lunge forward, press eagerly for release.\
 The amazement which awaits is for you.\
 \
 We are here at the portal of the world we had wished for\
 (line 30) At the lintel (lintel — a horizontal support above a door or window) of the world we most need.\
 We are here roaring and singing.\
 We prove that we can not only make peace, we can bring it with us.\
 \
 With respect for the world and its people,\
 We can compete passionately without hatred.\
 (line 35) With respect for the world and its people,\
 We can take pride in the achievement of strangers.\
 With respect for the world and its people,\
 We can share openly in the success of friends.\
 \
 Here then is the Amazement:\
 (line 40) Against the odds of impending war,\
 In the mouth of bloody greed,\
 Human grace and human spirit can still conquer.\
 \
 Ah…\
 We discover, we ourselves\
 (line 45) Are the Amazement which awaits\
 We are ourselves Amazement.\

This is the true story of a Kenyan woman named Wangari Maathai.\
 \
 Excerpt from Seeds of Change:\
 Planting a Path to Peace\
 \
 by Jen Cullerton Johnson\
 \
 (paragraph 1) “Come,” Wangari’s mother called. She beckoned her young daughter over to a tall tree with a wide, smooth trunk and a crown of green, oval leaves.\
 \
 (paragraph 2) “Feel,” her mother whispered.\
 \
 (paragraph 3) Wangari spread her small hands over the tree’s trunk. She smoothed her fingers over the rough bark.\
 \
 (paragraph 4) “This is the mugumo,” her mother said. “It is home to many. It feeds many too.”\
 \
 (paragraph 5) She snapped off a wild fig from a low branch, and gave it to her daughter. Wangari ate the delicious fruit, just as geckos and elephants did. High in the tree, birds chirped in their nests. The branches bounced with jumping monkeys.\
 \
 (paragraph 6) “Our people, the Kikuyu of Kenya, believe that our ancestors rest in the tree’s shade,” her mother explained.\
 \
 (paragraph 7) Wangari wrapped her arms around the trunk as if hugging her great-grandmother’s spirit. She promised never to cut down the tree. . . .\
 \
 ((paragraph 8) When Wangari finished elementary school, she was eleven years old. Her mind was like a seed rooted in rich soil, ready to grow. Wangari wanted to continue her education, but to do so she would have to leave her village and move to the capital city of Nairobi. Wangari had never been farther than her valley’s ridge. She was scared.\
 \
 (paragraph 9) “Go,” her mother said. She picked up a handful of earth and placed it gently into her daughter’s hand. “Where you go, we go.” . . .\
 \
 (paragraph 10) As graduation neared, Wangari told her friends she wanted to become a biologist.\
 \
 (paragraph 11) “Not many native women become biologists,” they told her.\
 \
 (paragraph 12) “I will,” she said.\
 \
 (paragraph 13) Wangari watched sadly as her government sold more and more land to big companies that cut down forests for timber and to clear land for coffee plantations. Native trees such as cedar and acacia vanished. Without trees, birds had no place to nest. Monkeys lost their swings. Tired mothers walked miles for firewood. . . .\
 \
 (paragraph 14) When Wangari visited her village she saw that the Kikuyu custom of not chopping down the mugumo trees had been lost. No longer held in place by tree roots, the soil streamed into the rivers. The water that had been used to grow maize, bananas, and sweet potatoes turned to mud and dried up. Many families went hungry.\
 \
 (paragraph 15) Wangari could not bear to think of the land being destroyed. Now married and the mother of three children, she worried about what would happen to the mothers and children who depended on the land.\
 \
 (paragraph 16) “We must do something,” Wangari said.\
 \
 (paragraph 17) Wangari had an idea as small as a seed but as tall as a tree that reaches for the sky. “Harabee! Let’s work together!” she said to her countrywomen—mothers like her. Wangari dug deep into the soil, a seedling by her side. “We must plant trees.” . . .\
 \
 (paragraph 18) Wangari traveled to villages, towns, and cities with saplings and seeds, shovels and hoes. At each place she went, women planted rows of trees that looked like green belts across the land. Because of this they started calling themselves the Green Belt Movement.\
 \
 (paragraph 19) “We might not change the big world but we can change the landscape of the forest,” she said.\
 \
 (paragraph 20) One tree turned to ten, ten to one hundred, one hundred to one million, all the way up to thirty million planted trees. Kenya grew green again. Birds nested in new trees. Monkeys swung on branches. Rivers filled with clean water. Wild figs grew heavy in mugumo branches.\
 \
 (paragraph 21) Mothers fed their children maize, bananas, and sweet potatoes until they could eat no more.\

(A) as a description of how animal habitats changed\
 (B) as an explanation of the solution to a problem in the environment\

This story takes place in Japan. The narrator has just rented a new home on a small street named Lightning Alley.\
 \
 Excerpt from The Guest Cat\
 \
 by Takashi Hiraide\
 \
 (paragraph 1) The cat’s name was Chibi, which means “little one.” We could hear the boy’s particularly high-pitched voice calling the cat: “Chibi!” Then we’d hear the sound of the boy’s shoes running around outside, followed by the tinkling of the little bell announcing the cat’s arrival.\
 \
 (paragraph 2) Chibi was a jewel of a cat. Her pure white fur was mottled with several lampblack blotches containing just a bit of light brown. The sort of cat you might see just about anywhere in Japan, except she was especially slim and tiny.\
 \
 (paragraph 3) These were her individual characteristics—slim and small, with ears that stood out, tapering off beautifully at the tips, and often twitching. She would approach silently and undetected to rub up against one’s legs. At first I thought Chibi avoided me because I was not used to cats, but this seems not to have been the case. When a girl who often passed along Lightning Alley stopped and crouched to gaze at the cat, it did not run away. But as soon as she attempted to touch it, the cat quickly slipped off, avoiding contact at all costs. The cat’s manner of rejection was like cold, white light.\
 \
 (paragraph 4) Moreover, the cat rarely made a sound. As far as I remember, when it first appeared in the alley it made some sort of sound, but since then it had never let out a meow. It looked as if no matter how much time passed the cat was not going to let us hear its\
 voice. This seemed to be the message the cat was giving us.\
 \
 (paragraph 5) Another one of Chibi’s characteristics was that she changed the direction of her cautious attention frequently. This active behavior wasn’t limited to her kittenhood. Perhaps because she played alone most of the time in the expansive garden, she reacted strongly to insects and reptiles. And there were times when I could only conclude that she must be reacting to subtle changes in the wind and light, not detectable by humans. It may be that most cats share the same quickness, but even so, in Chibi’s case, it was acute—she was, after all, the cat of Lightning Alley. My wife got into the habit of pointing to the cat whenever it went by, extolling (extolling - praising) its virtues. . . .\
 \
 (paragraph 6) Chibi, who loved to play ball, gradually began to visit us on her own and would try and get us to play with her. She would step gingerly into the room and gaze intently at its occupants, then purposefully turn around and walk back out, as if to lead us to the garden. This process would be repeated until she got a response. Most of the time my wife would put down whatever she was doing, slip happily into her sandals and head outside.\
 \
 (paragraph 7) Having played to her heart’s content, Chibi would come inside and rest for a while. When she began to sleep on the sofa—like a talisman (talisman - an object thought to bring good luck) curled gently in the shape of a comma and dug up from a prehistoric archaeological site—a deep sense of happiness arrived, as if the house itself had dreamed this scene.\
 \
 (paragraph 8) Avoiding the prying eyes of the landlady, we began leaving it up to Chibi to come inside the house whenever she wanted—and with this new development I had begun little by little to understand cat lovers. Whether on TV or in all of the ubiquitous (ubiquitous - present everywhere) cat calendars, it seemed as if there was no cat comparable to her. But, though I had started to think of her as the best cat around, she was not really our cat.\
 \
 (paragraph 9) First we would hear the tinkling of the bell, and then she would appear, so we began to call her by the nickname “Tinkerbell.” Whenever we wanted her to come over, this name seemed to find itself on our lips.\
 \
 (paragraph 10) “I wonder where Tinkerbell is.” By the time my wife had gotten the words out of her mouth we’d hear the tinkling of Chibi’s bell. We’d realize that she was near at the point where, exiting the foyer next door (located at the second corner of Lightning Alley), Chibi would leap through the tear in the wire-mesh boundary of the property, dash along the side of the building, turn at the far end of the veranda, leap up onto the open area of the deck, and then, placing her front paws on the window frame at about the height of a human adult’s knee, stretch out her neck to peek inside.\
 \
 (paragraph 11) In winter she came inside. Little by little, through the crack in the partially opened window, her tendency to visit subtly developed; her appearances were repeated until, as if a silken opening in a fabric had been continuously moistened and stretched, Chibi had entered our lives. But at the same time—call it fate if you will—something else was closing in and pressing itself against that tendency.\
Which statement would be most important to include in a summary of the story?\
(A) Chibi looks especially slim and tiny for a cat.\
 (B) Chibi grows comfortable with the narrator and his wife.\
 (C) Chibi avoids being touched by humans.\
 (D) Chibi rarely makes a sound except for the tinkling of her bell.\

Reading Comprehension Passage C\
 Many Animals Can Count, Some Better Than You\
 \
 Every night during breeding season, the male túngara frog of Central America will stake\
 out a performance patch in the local pond and spend unbroken hours broadcasting\
 his splendor to the world.\
 The mud-brown frog is barely the size of a shelled pecan, but his call is large and\
 (line 5) dynamic, a long downward sweep that sounds remarkably like a phaser weapon on\
 \"Star Trek,\" followed by a brief, twangy, harmonically dense chuck.(chuck - a clucking sound)\
 Unless, that is, a competing male starts calling nearby, in which case the first frog is\
 likely to add two chucks to the tail of his sweep. And should his rival respond likewise,\
 Male A will tack on three chucks.\
 (line 10) Back and forth they go, call and raise, until the frogs hit their respiratory limit at six\
 to seven rapid-fire chucks.\
 The acoustic one-upfrogship is energetically draining and risks attracting predators like\
 bats. Yet the male frogs have no choice but to keep count of the competition, for the simple\
 reason that female túngaras are doing the same: listening, counting and ultimately mating\
 (line 15) with the male of maximum chucks.\
 Behind the frog’s surprisingly sophisticated number sense, scientists have found, are\
 specialized cells in the amphibian midbrain that tally up sound signals and the intervals\
 between them.\
 \"The neurons are counting the number of appropriate pulses, and they’re highly\
 (line 20) selective,\" said Gary Rose, a biologist at the University of Utah. If the timing between\
 pulses is off by just a fraction of a second, the neurons don’t fire and the counting process\
 breaks down. …\
 Scientists have found that animals across the evolutionary spectrum have a keen sense\
 of quantity, able to distinguish not just bigger from smaller or more from less, but two from\
 (line 25) four, four from ten, forty from sixty.\
 Orb-weaving spiders, for example, keep a tally of how many silk-wrapped prey items are\
 stashed in the \"larder\" segment of their web. When scientists experimentally remove the\
 cache, the spiders will spend time searching for the stolen goods in proportion to how many\
 separate items had been taken, rather than how big the total prey mass might have been.\
 (line 30) Small fish benefit from living in schools, and the more numerous the group, the\
 statistically better a fish’s odds of escaping predation. As a result, many shoaling (shoaling - shallow water) fish are\
 excellent appraisers of relative head counts.\
 Guppies, for example, have a so-called contrast ratio of .8, which means they can\
 distinguish at a glance between four guppies and five, or eight guppies and ten, and if given\
 (line 35) the chance will swim toward the slightly fishier crowd.\
 Three-spined sticklebacks (sticklebacks - carnivorous fish) are more discriminating still: with a contrast ratio of .86,\
 they’re able to tell six fellow fish from seven, or 18 from 21 — a comparative power that\
 many birds, mammals and even humans might find hard to beat.\
 Despite the prevalence of math phobia, people too are born with a strong innate\
 (line 40) number sense, and numerosity is deeply embedded in many aspects of our minds and\
 culture.\
 Researchers have determined that number words for small quantities — less than five —\
 are strikingly similar across virtually every language studied, and the words are among the\
 most stable, unchanging utterances in any lexicon. (lexicon - language)\
 (line 45) They are more conserved through time and across cultures than words for other\
 presumably bedrock concepts like mother, father and most body parts, with a few puzzling\
 exceptions like the words for tongue and eye.\
 \"The sounds that you and I use to say ‘two’ or ‘three’ are the sounds that have been used\
 for tens of thousands of years,\" said Mark Pagel, a biologist who studies the evolution of\
 (line 50) language at the University of Reading.\
 \"It’s not out of the question that you could have been wandering around 15,000 years\
 ago and encountered a few of the last remaining Neanderthals, pointed to yourself and said,\
 ‘one,’ and pointed to them and said, ‘three,’ and those words, in an odd, coarse way, would\
 have been understood.\"\
 (line 55) That continuity, Dr. Pagel added, \"should astonish us.\" …\
 Attitudes about animal numerosity have changed dramatically since the mid-twentieth\
 century when many researchers believed only humans had enough gray matter to think\
 quantitatively. They cited as an object lesson the 1907 case of Clever Hans, the horse that\
 supposedly could solve arithmetic problems and would tap out his answers by hoof; as it\
 (line 60) turned out, he was responding to unconscious cues from the people around him.\
 Since then, researchers have approached the field with caution and rigor, seeking to\
 identify the specific evolutionary pressures that might spur the need for numeric judgments\
 in any given species.\
 Social carnivores like spotted hyenas, for example, live in fission-fusion societies, (fission-fusion societies - animals whose social group composition and size change as they move throughout their environment)\
 (line 65) collectively defending their territories against rivals but in ever-shifting groups of widely\
 roaming members. \"You can never predict who you’ll find in which group,\" said Sarah\
 Benson-Amram, an assistant professor of zoology and physiology at the University of\
 Wyoming. \"You might be alone or in a group of ten.\"\
 Because hyena jaws can pulverize zebra bones, encounters between [rival hyena]\
 (line 70) competitors can prove deadly; every spotted hyena must have a good sense from moment\
 to moment of how many there are of us versus how many of them. Dr. Benson-Amram and\
 her colleagues tested hyena numerosity skills in the field, playing back the recorded whoops\
 of spotted hyenas living in South Africa and Namibia to hyenas in Kenya.\
 The Kenyan carnivores reacted to the whoops of strangers as predicted, approaching\
 (line 75)\
 the hidden source of the sound when they had a home team advantage, retreating when\
 they heard a few too many distinctive voices in a row. Or sometimes, when the local hyenas\
 were outnumbered, they’d call for backup. …\
 Chimpanzees are social scorekeepers, episodic (episodic - periodic) warriors and number ninjas, too.\
 They can be taught to associate groups of objects with corresponding Arabic numerals up\
 (line 80) to the number 9 and sometimes beyond — three squares on a computer screen with the\
 number 3, five squares with 5, and so on. They can put those numerals in order.\
 The numeric working memory of young chimpanzees is astonishing: Flash a random\
 scattering of numerals on a screen for just 210 milliseconds — half an eye blink — and then\
 cover the numbers with white squares, and a numerically schooled young chimpanzee will\
 (line 85) touch the squares sequentially to indicate the ascending order of the numbers hidden\
 beneath.\
 Don’t bother trying to do this yourself, Tetsuro Matsuzawa, a primatologist at Kyoto\
 University, said at the scientific meeting in London on which the themed journal (the themed journal - a publication where animal numerosity studies were discussed) was based.\
 \"You can’t.\" …\
 (line 90) Stanislas Dehaene, a psychologist at the University of Paris, and his colleagues\
 presented evidence from brain scans of professional mathematicians that the neural\
 circuitry (neural circuitry - nerve cells) for advanced mathematical thinking is an elaboration on the archaic (archaic - primitive) number sense\
 we share with other animals. …\
 We hear that the price of something rose by 50 percent and then fell by 50 percent, and\
 (line 95) we reflexively, mistakenly conclude, \"Oh good, we’re back to where we started.\" Our natural\
 number sense adds and subtracts whole numbers, whole chucks, guppies and hyenas.\
 But it really abhors a fraction, and so has led us astray.\

Reading Comprehension Passage A\
 \
 The factory made the best centrifugal pumps in the world, and Merle Waggoner owned\
 it. He’d started it. He’d just been offered two million dollars for it by the General Forge and\
 Foundry Company. He didn’t have any stockholders and he didn’t owe a dime. He was\
 fifty-one, a widower, and he had one heir—a son. The boy’s name was Franklin. The boy\
 (line 5) was named after Benjamin Franklin.\
 \
 One Friday afternoon father and son came out of Merle’s office and into the factory.\
 They went down a factory aisle to Rudy Linberg’s lathe. (lathe — a machine on which a piece of material, such as wood or metal, is spun and shaped against a fixed\
 cutting tool)\
 \
 “Rudy,” said Merle, “the boy here’s home from college for three days, and I thought\
 maybe you and him and your boy and me might go out to the farm and shoot some clay\
 (line 10) pigeons tomorrow.”\
 \
 Rudy turned his sky-blue eyes to Merle and young Franklin. He was Merle’s age, and\
 he had the deep and narrow dignity of a man who had learned his limitations early—who\
 had never tried to go beyond them. His limitations were those of his tools, his flute and his\
 shotgun. …\
 \
 (line 15) “Let’s go ask my boy what he’s got on tomorrow,” said Rudy. It was a formality. Karl\
 always did what his father wanted him to do—did it with profound love. …\
 \
 Karl was a carbon copy of his father. He was such a good mimic of Rudy that his joints\
 seemed to ache a little with age. He seemed sobered by fifty-one years of life, though he’d\
 lived only twenty. He seemed instinctively wary of safety hazards that had been eliminated\
 (line 20) from the factory by the time he’d learned to walk. Karl stood at attention without humility,\
 just as his father had done.\
 \
 “Want to go shooting tomorrow?” said Rudy.\
 “Shoot what?” said Karl.\
 “Crows. Clay pigeons,” said Rudy. “Maybe a woodchuck.”\
 \
 (line 25)“Don’t mind,” said Karl. He nodded briefly to Merle and Franklin. “Glad to.” …\
 Rudy nodded. He examined the work in Karl’s lathe and tapped his own temple. The\
 tapping was a signal that Franklin had seen many times on hunts. It meant that Karl was\
 doing fine.\
 \
 Rudy touched Karl’s elbow lightly. It was the signal for Karl to get back to work. Rudy\
 (line 30) and Karl each held up a crooked finger and saluted with it. Franklin knew what that meant\
 too. It meant, “Good-by, I love you.” …\
 \
 Merle was sitting at his desk, his head down, when Franklin came in. He held a steel\
 plate about six inches square in his left hand. In the middle of the plate was a hole two inches\
 square. In his right hand he held a steel cube that fitted the hole exactly. …\
 \
 (line 35) Franklin sat down gingerly on a hard chair by the wall. The office hadn’t changed much\
 in the years he’d known it. It was one more factory room, with naked pipes overhead—the\
 cold ones sweaty, the hot ones dry. Wires snaked from steel box to steel box. The green walls\
 and cream trim were as rough as elephant hide in some places, with alternating coats of\
 paint and grime, paint and grime.\
 \
 (line 40) There had never been time to scrape away the layers, and barely enough time,\
 overnight, to slap on new paint. And there had never been time in which to finish the rough\
 shelves that lined the room. …\
 \
 Merle slipped the cube through the square hole once more. “Know what these are?” he\
 said.\
 \
 (line 45) “Yes, sir,” said Franklin. “They’re what Rudy Linberg had to make when he was an\
 apprentice in Sweden.”\
 The cube could be slipped through the hole in twenty-four different ways, without\
 letting the tiniest ray of light pass through with it.\
 \
 “Unbelievable skill,” said Franklin respectfully. “There aren’t craftsmen like that\
 (line 50) coming along any more.” He didn’t really feel much respect. He was simply saying what he\
 knew his father wanted to hear. The cube and the hole struck him as criminal wastes of time\
 and great bores. “Unbelievable,” he said again.\
 \
 “It’s utterly unbelievable, when you realize that Rudy didn’t make them,” said Merle\
 gravely, “when you realize what generation the man who made them belongs to.”\
 \
 (line 55) “Oh?” said Franklin. “Who did make them?”\
 \
 “Rudy’s boy, Karl,” said Merle. “A member of your generation.” He ground out his cigar\
 sadly. “He gave them to me on my last birthday. They were on my desk, boy, waiting for me\
 when I came in—right beside the ones Rudy gave me thirty-one years before.” …\
 \
 “I could have cried, boy, when I saw those two plates and those two cubes side by side,”\
 (line 60) said Merle. “Can you understand that?” he asked beseechingly. “Can you understand why\
 I’d feel like crying?” …\
 \
 “The cube of Karl’s fitted through the hole of Rudy’s!” said Merle. “They were\
 interchangeable!”\
 \
 “Gosh!” said Franklin. “I’ll be darned. Really?”\
 \
 (line 65) And now he felt like crying, because he didn’t care, couldn’t care—and would have\
 given his right arm to care. The factory whanged and banged and screeched in monstrous\
 irrelevance—Franklin’s, all Franklin’s, if he just said the word.\
 \
 “What’ll you do with it—buy a theater in New York?” said Merle abruptly.\
 \
 “Do with what, sir?” said Franklin.\
 \
 (line 70) “The money I’ll get for the factory when I sell it—the money I’ll leave to you when I’m\
 dead,” said Merle. He hit the word “dead” hard. “What’s Waggoner Pump going to be\
 converted into? Waggoner Theaters? Waggoner School of Acting? The Waggoner Home for\
 Broken-Down Actors?”\
 \
 “I—I hadn’t thought about it,” said Franklin. The idea of converting Waggoner Pump\
 (line 75) into something equally complicated hadn’t occurred to him, and appalled him now. He was\
 being asked to match his father’s passion for the factory with an equal passion for something\
 else. And Franklin had no such passion—for the theater or anything else. …\
 \
 “Don’t sell on my account,” said Franklin wretchedly.\
 \
 “On whose account would I keep it?” said Merle.\
 \
 (line 80) “Do you have to sell it today?” said Franklin, horrified.\
 \
 “Strike while the iron’s hot, I always say,” said Merle. “Today’s the day you decided to\
 be an actor, and, as luck would have it, we have an excellent offer for what I did with my\
 life.”\
 \
 “Couldn’t we wait?”\
 \
 (line 85) “For what?” said Merle. He was having a good time now.\
 \
 “Father!” cried Franklin. “For the love of heaven, father, please!” He hung his head and\
 shook it. “I don’t know what I’m doing,” he said brokenly. “I don’t know for sure what I want\
 to do yet. I’m just playing with ideas, trying to find myself. Please, father, don’t sell what\
 you’ve done with your life, don’t just throw it away because I’m not sure I want to do that\
 (line 90) with my life too! Please!” Franklin looked up. “I’m not Karl Linberg,” he said. “I can’t help\
 it. I’m sorry, but I’m not Karl Linberg.” …\

Reading Comprehension Passage C\
 Many Animals Can Count, Some Better Than You\
 \
 Every night during breeding season, the male túngara frog of Central America will stake\
 out a performance patch in the local pond and spend unbroken hours broadcasting\
 his splendor to the world.\
 The mud-brown frog is barely the size of a shelled pecan, but his call is large and\
 (line 5) dynamic, a long downward sweep that sounds remarkably like a phaser weapon on\
 \"Star Trek,\" followed by a brief, twangy, harmonically dense chuck.(chuck - a clucking sound)\
 Unless, that is, a competing male starts calling nearby, in which case the first frog is\
 likely to add two chucks to the tail of his sweep. And should his rival respond likewise,\
 Male A will tack on three chucks.\
 (line 10) Back and forth they go, call and raise, until the frogs hit their respiratory limit at six\
 to seven rapid-fire chucks.\
 The acoustic one-upfrogship is energetically draining and risks attracting predators like\
 bats. Yet the male frogs have no choice but to keep count of the competition, for the simple\
 reason that female túngaras are doing the same: listening, counting and ultimately mating\
 (line 15) with the male of maximum chucks.\
 Behind the frog’s surprisingly sophisticated number sense, scientists have found, are\
 specialized cells in the amphibian midbrain that tally up sound signals and the intervals\
 between them.\
 \"The neurons are counting the number of appropriate pulses, and they’re highly\
 (line 20) selective,\" said Gary Rose, a biologist at the University of Utah. If the timing between\
 pulses is off by just a fraction of a second, the neurons don’t fire and the counting process\
 breaks down. …\
 Scientists have found that animals across the evolutionary spectrum have a keen sense\
 of quantity, able to distinguish not just bigger from smaller or more from less, but two from\
 (line 25) four, four from ten, forty from sixty.\
 Orb-weaving spiders, for example, keep a tally of how many silk-wrapped prey items are\
 stashed in the \"larder\" segment of their web. When scientists experimentally remove the\
 cache, the spiders will spend time searching for the stolen goods in proportion to how many\
 separate items had been taken, rather than how big the total prey mass might have been.\
 (line 30) Small fish benefit from living in schools, and the more numerous the group, the\
 statistically better a fish’s odds of escaping predation. As a result, many shoaling (shoaling - shallow water) fish are\
 excellent appraisers of relative head counts.\
 Guppies, for example, have a so-called contrast ratio of .8, which means they can\
 distinguish at a glance between four guppies and five, or eight guppies and ten, and if given\
 (line 35) the chance will swim toward the slightly fishier crowd.\
 Three-spined sticklebacks (sticklebacks - carnivorous fish) are more discriminating still: with a contrast ratio of .86,\
 they’re able to tell six fellow fish from seven, or 18 from 21 — a comparative power that\
 many birds, mammals and even humans might find hard to beat.\
 Despite the prevalence of math phobia, people too are born with a strong innate\
 (line 40) number sense, and numerosity is deeply embedded in many aspects of our minds and\
 culture.\
 Researchers have determined that number words for small quantities — less than five —\
 are strikingly similar across virtually every language studied, and the words are among the\
 most stable, unchanging utterances in any lexicon. (lexicon - language)\
 (line 45) They are more conserved through time and across cultures than words for other\
 presumably bedrock concepts like mother, father and most body parts, with a few puzzling\
 exceptions like the words for tongue and eye.\
 \"The sounds that you and I use to say ‘two’ or ‘three’ are the sounds that have been used\
 for tens of thousands of years,\" said Mark Pagel, a biologist who studies the evolution of\
 (line 50) language at the University of Reading.\
 \"It’s not out of the question that you could have been wandering around 15,000 years\
 ago and encountered a few of the last remaining Neanderthals, pointed to yourself and said,\
 ‘one,’ and pointed to them and said, ‘three,’ and those words, in an odd, coarse way, would\
 have been understood.\"\
 (line 55) That continuity, Dr. Pagel added, \"should astonish us.\" …\
 Attitudes about animal numerosity have changed dramatically since the mid-twentieth\
 century when many researchers believed only humans had enough gray matter to think\
 quantitatively. They cited as an object lesson the 1907 case of Clever Hans, the horse that\
 supposedly could solve arithmetic problems and would tap out his answers by hoof; as it\
 (line 60) turned out, he was responding to unconscious cues from the people around him.\
 Since then, researchers have approached the field with caution and rigor, seeking to\
 identify the specific evolutionary pressures that might spur the need for numeric judgments\
 in any given species.\
 Social carnivores like spotted hyenas, for example, live in fission-fusion societies, (fission-fusion societies - animals whose social group composition and size change as they move throughout their environment)\
 (line 65) collectively defending their territories against rivals but in ever-shifting groups of widely\
 roaming members. \"You can never predict who you’ll find in which group,\" said Sarah\
 Benson-Amram, an assistant professor of zoology and physiology at the University of\
 Wyoming. \"You might be alone or in a group of ten.\"\
 Because hyena jaws can pulverize zebra bones, encounters between [rival hyena]\
 (line 70) competitors can prove deadly; every spotted hyena must have a good sense from moment\
 to moment of how many there are of us versus how many of them. Dr. Benson-Amram and\
 her colleagues tested hyena numerosity skills in the field, playing back the recorded whoops\
 of spotted hyenas living in South Africa and Namibia to hyenas in Kenya.\
 The Kenyan carnivores reacted to the whoops of strangers as predicted, approaching\
 (line 75)\
 the hidden source of the sound when they had a home team advantage, retreating when\
 they heard a few too many distinctive voices in a row. Or sometimes, when the local hyenas\
 were outnumbered, they’d call for backup. …\
 Chimpanzees are social scorekeepers, episodic (episodic - periodic) warriors and number ninjas, too.\
 They can be taught to associate groups of objects with corresponding Arabic numerals up\
 (line 80) to the number 9 and sometimes beyond — three squares on a computer screen with the\
 number 3, five squares with 5, and so on. They can put those numerals in order.\
 The numeric working memory of young chimpanzees is astonishing: Flash a random\
 scattering of numerals on a screen for just 210 milliseconds — half an eye blink — and then\
 cover the numbers with white squares, and a numerically schooled young chimpanzee will\
 (line 85) touch the squares sequentially to indicate the ascending order of the numbers hidden\
 beneath.\
 Don’t bother trying to do this yourself, Tetsuro Matsuzawa, a primatologist at Kyoto\
 University, said at the scientific meeting in London on which the themed journal (the themed journal - a publication where animal numerosity studies were discussed) was based.\
 \"You can’t.\" …\
 (line 90) Stanislas Dehaene, a psychologist at the University of Paris, and his colleagues\
 presented evidence from brain scans of professional mathematicians that the neural\
 circuitry (neural circuitry - nerve cells) for advanced mathematical thinking is an elaboration on the archaic (archaic - primitive) number sense\
 we share with other animals. …\
 We hear that the price of something rose by 50 percent and then fell by 50 percent, and\
 (line 95) we reflexively, mistakenly conclude, \"Oh good, we’re back to where we started.\" Our natural\
 number sense adds and subtracts whole numbers, whole chucks, guppies and hyenas.\
 But it really abhors a fraction, and so has led us astray.\

Base your answers to questions 13 and 14 on the passage below and on your knowledge of social studies.\
 \
 …Lives were indeed about to be sacrificed for the sake of the hat. As for the veiling of women, it was officially discouraged, but not banned. In any case, veiling had been largely a middle-class custom, and the middle classes discarded it. The generality of women wore long headscarves, which they drew across their faces in the presence of male strangers. The government of the republic banned headscarves in official premises, including schools, under civil service regulations. Elsewhere they were tolerated and they have remained a feature of the Turkish scene to this day, while the ban on women’s headscarves in official premises is challenged every time that official pressure is relaxed.…\

 \
 This is the true story of a Kenyan woman named Wangari Maathai.\
 Excerpt from Seeds of Change:\
 Planting a Path to Peace\
 by Jen Cullerton Johnson\
 \
 (paragraph 1) “Come,” Wangari’s mother called. She beckoned her young daughter over to a tall tree with a wide, smooth trunk and a crown of green, oval leaves.\
 \
 (paragraph 2) “Feel,” her mother whispered.\
 \
 (paragraph 3) Wangari spread her small hands over the tree’s trunk. She smoothed her fingers over the rough bark.\
 \
 (paragraph 4) “This is the mugumo,” her mother said. “It is home to many. It feeds many too.”\
 \
 (paragraph 5) She snapped off a wild fig from a low branch, and gave it to her daughter. Wangari ate the delicious fruit, just as geckos and elephants did. High in the tree, birds chirped in their nests. The branches bounced with jumping monkeys.\
 \
 (paragraph 6) “Our people, the Kikuyu of Kenya, believe that our ancestors rest in the tree’s shade,” her mother explained.\
 \
 (paragraph 7) Wangari wrapped her arms around the trunk as if hugging her great-grandmother’s spirit. She promised never to cut down the tree. . . .\
 \
 ((paragraph 8) When Wangari finished elementary school, she was eleven years old. Her mind was like a seed rooted in rich soil, ready to grow. Wangari wanted to continue her education, but to do so she would have to leave her village and move to the capital city of Nairobi. Wangari had never been farther than her valley’s ridge. She was scared.\
 \
 (paragraph 9) “Go,” her mother said. She picked up a handful of earth and placed it gently into her daughter’s hand. “Where you go, we go.” . . .\
 \
 (paragraph 10) As graduation neared, Wangari told her friends she wanted to become a biologist.\
 \
 (paragraph 11) “Not many native women become biologists,” they told her.\
 \
 (paragraph 12) “I will,” she said.\
 \
 (paragraph 13) Wangari watched sadly as her government sold more and more land to big companies that cut down forests for timber and to clear land for coffee plantations. Native trees such as cedar and acacia vanished. Without trees, birds had no place to nest. Monkeys lost their swings. Tired mothers walked miles for firewood. . . .\
 \
 (paragraph 14) When Wangari visited her village she saw that the Kikuyu custom of not chopping down the mugumo trees had been lost. No longer held in place by tree roots, the soil streamed into the rivers. The water that had been used to grow maize, bananas, and sweet potatoes turned to mud and dried up. Many families went hungry.\
 \
 (paragraph 15) Wangari could not bear to think of the land being destroyed. Now married and the mother of three children, she worried about what would happen to the mothers and children who depended on the land.\
 \
 (paragraph 16) “We must do something,” Wangari said.\
 \
 (paragraph 17) Wangari had an idea as small as a seed but as tall as a tree that reaches for the sky. “Harabee! Let’s work together!” she said to her countrywomen—mothers like her. Wangari dug deep into the soil, a seedling by her side. “We must plant trees.” . . .\
 \
 (paragraph 18) Wangari traveled to villages, towns, and cities with saplings and seeds, shovels and hoes. At each place she went, women planted rows of trees that looked like green belts across the land. Because of this they started calling themselves the Green Belt Movement.\
 \

Reading Comprehension Passage C\
 \
 “The Russell-Einstein Manifesto,” signed by a group of eleven intellectuals and scientists including Bertrand Russell and Albert Einstein, was written at the height of the Cold War.\
 \
 In the tragic situation which confronts humanity, we feel that scientists should\
 assemble in conference to appraise the perils that have arisen as a result of the development\
 of weapons of mass destruction, and to discuss a resolution in the spirit of the appended\
 draft.\
 \
 (line 5) We are speaking on this occasion, not as members of this or that nation, continent, or\
 creed, but as human beings, members of the species Man, whose continued existence is in\
 doubt. The world is full of conflicts; and, overshadowing all minor conflicts, the titanic\
 struggle between Communism and anti-Communism. …\
 \
 We have to learn to think in a new way. We have to learn to ask ourselves, not what steps\
 (line 10) can be taken to give military victory to whatever group we prefer, for there no longer are\
 such steps; the question we have to ask ourselves is: what steps can be taken to prevent a\
 military contest of which the issue must be disastrous to all parties? …\
 \
 No doubt in an H-bomb (H-bomb — hydrogen bomb) war great cities would be obliterated. But this is one of the\
 minor disasters that would have to be faced. If everybody in London, New York, and\
 (line 15) Moscow were exterminated, the world might, in the course of a few centuries, recover from\
 the blow. But we now know, especially since the Bikini test, (Bikini test — reference to an American test of a hydrogen bomb conducted at the Bikini Atoll in the Pacific Ocean on March 1st, 1954. The bomb sent radioactive debris across the globe) that nuclear bombs can\
 gradually spread destruction over a very much wider area than had been supposed. …\
 \
 Many warnings have been uttered by eminent men of science and by authorities in\
 military strategy. None of them will say that the worst results are certain. What they do say\
 (line 20) is that these results are possible, and no one can be sure that they will not be realized. We\
 have not yet found that the views of experts on this question depend in any degree upon\
 their politics or prejudices. They depend only, so far as our researches have revealed, upon\
 the extent of the particular expert’s knowledge. We have found that the men who know most\
 are the most gloomy.\
 \
 (line 25) Here, then, is the problem which we present to you, stark and dreadful and inescapable:\
 Shall we put an end to the human race; or shall mankind renounce war? People will not face\
 this alternative because it is so difficult to abolish war.\
 \
 The abolition of war will demand distasteful limitations of national sovereignty. But\
 what perhaps impedes understanding of the situation more than anything else is that the\
 (line 30) term “mankind” feels vague and abstract. People scarcely realize in imagination that the\
 danger is to themselves and their children and their grandchildren, and not only to a dimly\
 apprehended humanity. They can scarcely bring themselves to grasp that they, individually,\
 and those whom they love are in imminent (imminent — about to take place) danger of perishing agonizingly. And so they\
 hope that perhaps war may be allowed to continue provided modern weapons are\
 (line 35) prohibited.\
 \
 This hope is illusory. Whatever agreements not to use H-bombs had been reached in\
 time of peace, they would no longer be considered binding in time of war, and both sides\
 would set to work to manufacture H-bombs as soon as war broke out, for, if one side\
 manufactured the bombs and the other did not, the side that manufactured them would\
 (line 40) inevitably be victorious.\
 \
 Although an agreement to renounce nuclear weapons as part of a general reduction of\
 armaments would not afford an ultimate solution, it would serve certain important purposes.\
 First: any agreement between East and West is to the good in so far as it tends to diminish\
 tension. Second: the abolition of thermo-nuclear weapons, if each side believed that the\
 (line 45) other had carried it out sincerely, would lessen the fear of a sudden attack in the style of\
 Pearl Harbour, which at present keeps both sides in a state of nervous apprehension. We\
 should, therefore, welcome such an agreement, though only as a first step.\
 \
 Most of us are not neutral in feeling, but, as human beings, we have to remember that,\
 if the issues between East and West are to be decided in any manner that can give any\
 (line 50) possible satisfaction to anybody, whether Communist or anti-Communist, whether Asian or\
 European or American, whether White or Black, then these issues must not be decided by\
 war. We should wish this to be understood, both in the East and in the West.\
 \
 There lies before us, if we choose, continual progress in happiness, knowledge, and\
 wisdom. Shall we, instead, choose death, because we cannot forget our quarrels? We\
 (line 55) appeal, as human beings, to human beings: Remember your humanity, and forget the rest.\
 If you can do so, the way lies open to a new Paradise; if you cannot, there lies before you\
 the risk of universal death.\
 \
 Resolution\
 \
 We invite this Congress, (Congress — the group of scientists who signed the Manifesto) and through it the scientists of the world and the general\
 public, to subscribe to the following resolution:\
 \
 (line 60) “In view of the fact that in any future world war nuclear weapons will certainly be\
 employed, and that such weapons threaten the continued existence of mankind, we urge\
 the Governments of the world to realize, and to acknowledge publicly, that their\
 purpose cannot be furthered by a world war, and we urge them, consequently, to find\
 peaceful means for the settlement of all matters of dispute between them.”\
 \
 —Bertrand Russell\
 excerpted from “The Russell–Einstein Manifesto”\
 July 9, 1955\
The rhetorical question posed in line 26 emphasizes the\
(1) unavoidable nature of the problem\
 (2) important issue of national sovereignty\
 (3) likely elimination of weapons of mass destruction\
 (4) probable establishment of a new world power\

Reading Comprehension Passage C\
 \
 Get That Song Outta My Head!\
 \
    The nightmare began when my husband walked into our kitchen and said, “I’ve had this\
 song stuck in my head all day …”\
    No! I thought. Don’t say it!\
    “Remember that song from the original Karate Kid movie?” he continued.\
 (line 5)   For the love of God, no!\
    “You know how it goes. ‘You’re the best around … na na na na na, na na na na. You’re\
 the best around …”\
    It was too late. Now I had an earworm — a song, melody or jingle that gets stuck in your\
 head.\
 (line 10)   The worst part? I only knew that same line. I walked around humming it for days. I tried\
 to shake it by singing along with tunes playing on my car radio while I was out running\
 errands. For a brief time, Van Halen’s “Runnin’ With the Devil” replaced it.\
    But in no time at all, that one line from “You’re the Best,” sung by Joe Esposito on the\
 The Karate Kid soundtrack, was back.\
 (line 15)   Perhaps if I heard more of the song in my head, it wouldn’t be as annoying. But just this\
 one line? Over and over and over again? It was pure torture. I needed to do something\
 drastic. I busted out that 1980s hit, “The Safety Dance” by Men Without Hats. After singing\
 it a few times, the earworm was gone.\
    I knew I’d get another one, though. About 90 percent of people experience earworms\
 (line 20) at least once a week, according to the Earworm Project run by the Music, Mind and Brain\
 group at Goldsmiths, University of London.\
    “Music lovers, specifically people who ascribe (ascribe - credit) more importance to music or people\
 who spend more time listening to music, have more frequent and longer earworm\
 episodes,” says Kelly Jakubowski, a researcher with the Earworm Project. …\
 (line 25)   To find out what causes earworms and how to get rid of them, I contacted the man\
 known as “Dr. Earworm,” James Kellaris, a marketing professor at the University of\
 Cincinnati. Certainly with a nickname like that, he would know something.\
    Kellaris began studying earworms in 1999. A former professional musician prone to\
 getting earworms himself, he eventually became a marketing professor “interested in how\
 (line 30) marketers use music to achieve various commercial goals,” he says. “It was a perfect storm\
 to create an earworms researcher.”\
    He explained to me that when we get an earworm, the tune seems to repeat itself\
 involuntarily, which is why experts consider earworms involuntary musical imagery (INMI).\
 This was exactly what “You’re the Best” had done to me.\
 (line 35)   So what, precisely, was happening in my brain when I couldn’t shake that tune?\
 Jakubowski contributed to a May 2015 study led by Nicolas Farrugia, a postdoctoral\
 researcher with the Earworm Project, that demonstrated auditory and inhibitory-related\
 areas play a role in earworms as well.\
    The researchers examined 44 healthy subjects, all between 25 and 70 years old and all\
 (line 40) participants of a past neuroimaging study run by the Cambridge Medical Research\
 Council’s Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit. These subjects took an online survey that\
 measured both the extent of their musical training and how strongly INMIs impacted them.\
 For example, the survey wanted to know how strong of a negative impact INMIs had on\
 them or if INMIs were actually helpful while they went about their everyday activities.\
 (line 45)   When they examined these participants’ brain images, one pattern in particular stuck\
 out: People who got earworms more often had a thinner right frontal cortex, which is\
 involved in inhibition, (inhibition -restraining behavior) and a thinner temporal cortex, which processes sensory stimuli like\
 sound. In other words, these people’s brains just weren’t as good at suppressing the random\
 song that might pop into their heads.\
 (line 50)   Why we get earworms, unfortunately, remains a scientific mystery. “We know that songs\
 that are ‘catchy’ — short, simple, repetitive and contain some incongruity — are most likely\
 to get stuck,” Kellaris says. Most people are more likely to get a song like “Don’t Worry, Be\
 Happy” stuck in their heads than, say, a Mahler symphony. And some things exacerbate\
 them: frequency and duration of exposure to music, worry, stress, fatigue and idleness.\
 (line 55)   Considering that my husband kept singing the snippet (snippet - short piece) while I was tired and stressed,\
 I can see why it got stuck. But my earworms have been relatively innocuous. (innocuous - harmless) Even though\
 they’re annoying, I can eventually get rid of them. Some people can’t, though.\
    Part of Kellaris’ earliest research involved mailing a questionnaire to about 1,000\
 respondents at four U.S. universities. He asked them if they’d ever had an earworm, for how\
 (line 60) long, how often it happened, how it made them feel, etc.\
    One respondent claimed to have had a song stuck in his head since 1978. This is known\
 as intrusive musical imagery (IMI), a musical obsession that’s chronic and highly distracting\
 to a person’s everyday life and work. According to Dean McKay, a psychology professor at\
 Fordham University, my short-lived earworm was nothing compared to an IMI.\
 (line 65)   But now I was concerned. Could my future earworms turn into these IMIs? Is there a\
 way to prevent this from happening?\
    McKay co-authored a June 2014 study titled “Musical obsessions: A comprehensive\
 review of neglected clinical phenomena.” For this study, McKay and other international\
 colleagues, all of whom treat obsessive-compulsive disorder, created the first\
 (line 70) comprehensive review of musical obsessions. They compiled a database of 96 case study\
 descriptions of people with severe musical obsessions — the largest compilation (compilation - collection) assembled\
 on this topic. They determined the characteristics of musical obsessions such as IMIs and\
 compared them with earworms, musical hallucinations and visual obsessional imagery.\
    The group’s research showed that IMIs can be treated by using a method known as\
 (line 75) distraction — coming up with a competing melody to think about that would get rid of the\
 IMI. That’s exactly what I had done, albeit unknowingly, when I used “The Safety Dance”\
 to stop my earworm.\
    McKay says my earworm was pesky because I knew only that one part of the song. He\
 suggests if I have just a portion of a song looping in my brain in the future, I can try another\
 (line 80) method called exposure — simply listening to the entire song. “It’s like a completion task,”\
 he says. “Once you know the whole song, then there’s no need for it to be stuck in your\
 head.”\
    Another form of distraction is to sing the song out loud, but change some of the words\
 or slightly throw off the melody. One of McKay’s patients had an IMI based on a Taylor\
 (line 85) Swift song. “We made up some other words for it,” he explains. “We messed up the melody\
 a bit, but not so much that it wasn’t recognizable as still being that song, and then it faded.”\
 McKay stresses that this is the only case he’s tried this in, so it’s not a forgone conclusion\
 this kind of distraction would work in other instances.\
    What I wanted to know was if the earworm I get today could become the IMI of\
 (line 90) tomorrow.\
    “Highly improbable,” he says.\
    “You’re the best,” I reply.\
    Oh no.\

 crêpe de—crêpe de—oh, this thin black goods.(goods - fabric) Her hat was black, and from it drooped and\
 fluttered an ebon veil, filmy as a spider’s web. She stood on the top step and drew on black\
 silk gloves. Not a speck of white or a spot of color about her dress anywhere. Her rich\
 (line 5) golden hair was drawn, with scarcely a ripple, into a shining, smooth knot low on her neck.\
 Her face was plain rather than pretty, but it was now illuminated and made almost beautiful\
 by her large gray eyes that gazed above the houses across the street into the sky with an\
 expression of the most appealing sadness and melancholy. …\
    “It’s a fine, clear evening, Miss Conway,” he [Andy Donovan] said; and if the Weather\
 (line 10) Bureau could have heard the confident emphasis of his tones it would have hoisted the\
 square white signal, (square white signal - a sign of good weather) and nailed it to the mast.\
    “To them that has the heart to enjoy it, it is, Mr. Donovan,” said Miss Conway, with\
 a sigh. …\
    “I hope none of your relatives—I hope you haven’t sustained a loss?” ventured\
 (line 15) Mr. Donovan.\
    “Death has claimed,” said Miss Conway, hesitating—“not a relative, but one who—but\
 I will not intrude my grief upon you, Mr. Donovan.”\
    “Intrude?” protested Mr. Donovan. “Why, say, Miss Conway, I’d be delighted, that is,\
 I’d be sorry—I mean I’m sure nobody could sympathize with you truer than I would.”\
 (line 20)   Miss Conway smiled a little smile. And oh, it was sadder than her expression in repose. (repose - at rest) …\
    “It’s tough to be alone in New York—that’s a cinch,” said Mr. Donovan. “But, say—\
 whenever this little old town does loosen up and get friendly it goes the limit. Say you took\
 a little stroll in the park, Miss Conway—don’t you think it might chase away some of your\
 mullygrubs? And if you’d allow me—”\
 (line 25)   “Thanks, Mr. Donovan. I’d be pleased to accept of your escort if you think the company\
 of one whose heart is filled with gloom could be anyways agreeable to you.”\
    Through the open gates of the iron-railed, old, downtown park, where the elect once\
 took the air, they strolled, and found a quiet bench. …\
    “He was my fiancé,” confided Miss Conway, at the end of an hour. “We were going to\
 (line 30) be married next spring. I don’t want you to think that I am stringing you, Mr. Donovan, but\
 he was a real Count. He had an estate and a castle in Italy. Count Fernando Mazzini was\
 his name. I never saw the beat of him for elegance. Papa objected, of course, and once \
 we eloped, but papa overtook us, and took us back. I thought sure papa and Fernando \
 would fight a duel. Papa has a livery business—in P’kipsee [Poughkeepsie], you know.” … \
 (line 35)    “Three days ago I got a letter from Italy, forwarded from P’kipsee, saying that Fernando \
 had been killed in a gondola accident.” … \
    “I’ve got his picture here in my locket,” said Miss Conway, after wiping her eyes with \
 her handkerchief. “I never showed it to anybody; but I will to you, Mr. Donovan, because \
 I believe you to be a true friend.” \
 (line 40)   Mr. Donovan gazed long and with much interest at the photograph in the locket that \
 Miss Conway opened for him. The face of Count Mazzini was one to command interest. \
 It was a smooth, intelligent, bright, almost a handsome face—the face of a strong, cheerful \
 man who might well be a leader among his fellows. \
    “I have a larger one, framed, in my room,” said Miss Conway. “When we return I will\
 (line 45) show you that. They are all I have to remind me of Fernando. But he ever will be present \
 in my heart, that’s a sure thing.” \
    A subtle task confronted Mr. Donovan,—that of supplanting (supplanting - replacing) the unfortunate Count in \
 the heart of Miss Conway. This his admiration for her determined him to do. But the \
 magnitude of the undertaking did not seem to weigh upon his spirits. The sympathetic but\
 (line 50) cheerful friend was the role he essayed; (essayed - attempted) and he played it so successfully that the next \
 half-hour found them conversing pensively across two plates of ice-cream, though yet there \
 was no diminution of the sadness in Miss Conway’s large gray eyes. \
    Before they parted in the hall that evening she ran upstairs and brought down the \
 framed photograph wrapped lovingly in a white silk scarf. Mr. Donovan surveyed it with\
 (line 55) inscrutable (inscrutable - unreadable) eyes. … \
    “A fine-looking man,” said Mr. Donovan, heartily. “How would it suit you, Miss Conway, \
 to give me the pleasure of your company to Coney [Island] next Sunday afternoon?” \
    A month later they announced their engagement to Mrs. Scott and the other boarders. \
 Miss Conway continued to wear black.\
 (line 60)   A week after the announcement the two sat on the same bench in the downtown park, \
 while the fluttering leaves of the trees made a dim kinetoscopic (kinetoscopic - flickering) picture of them in the \
 moonlight. But Donovan had worn a look of abstracted gloom all day. He was so silent \
 to-night that love’s lips could not keep back any longer the questions that love’s heart \
 propounded. (propounded - put forward)\
 (line 65)   “What’s the matter, Andy, you are so solemn and grouchy to-night?”\
    “Nothing, Maggie.”\
    “I know better. Can’t I tell? You never acted this way before. What is it?” … \
    “I’ll tell you then,” said Andy, wisely, “but I guess you won’t understand it exactly. \
 You’ve heard of Mike Sullivan, haven’t you? ‘Big Mike’ Sullivan, everybody calls him.”\
 (line 70)   “No, I haven’t,” said Maggie. “And I don’t want to, if he makes you act like this. Who is \
 he?” …\
    “Well, Big Mike’s a friend of mine. I ain’t more than deuce-high in the district as far as \
 influence goes, but Mike’s as good a friend to a little man, or a poor man as he is to a big \
 one. I met him to-day on the Bowery [Street], and what do you think he does? Comes up\
 (line 75) and shakes hands. ‘Andy,’ says he, ‘I’ve been keeping cases on you. You’ve been putting in \
 some good licks over on your side of the street, and I’m proud of you. What’ll you take to \
 drink?’ He takes a cigar, and I take a highball. I told him I was going to get married in two \
 weeks. ‘Andy,’ says he, ‘send me an invitation, so I’ll keep in mind of it, and I’ll come to the \
 wedding.’ That’s what Big Mike says to me; and he always does what he says. \
 (line 80)   “You don’t understand it, Maggie, but I’d have one of my hands cut off to have Big Mike \
 Sullivan at our wedding. It would be the proudest day of my life. When he goes to a man’s \
 wedding, there’s a guy being married that’s made for life. Now, that’s why I’m maybe looking \
 sore to-night.”\
    “Why don’t you invite him, then, if he’s so much to the mustard?” (to the mustard - successful) said Maggie, lightly. …\
 (line 85)   “Maggie,” said Andy, presently, “do you think as much of me as you did of your—as you \
 did of the Count Mazzini?”\
    He waited a long time, but Maggie did not reply. And then, suddenly she leaned against \
 his shoulder and began to cry—to cry and shake with sobs, holding his arm tightly, and \
 wetting the crêpe de Chine with tears. …\
 (line 90)   But instead of being pushed away, she found Andy’s arm folding her closer. She looked \
 up and saw his face cleared and smiling. …\
    “Andy,” said Maggie, with a somewhat shy smile, after she had been thoroughly assured \
 of forgiveness, “did you believe all that story about the Count?” \
    “Well, not to any large extent,” said Andy, reaching for his cigar case, “because it’s\
 (line 95) Big Mike Sullivan’s picture you’ve got in that locket of yours.” \

Excerpt from Humans With Amazing Senses\
 \
 When bats go out to hunt, they send out sonar signals at such high frequencies and in\
 such rapid bursts that they can hear the signals bounce off mosquitoes in midair. They\
 then zero in on the insects like laser-guided missiles. Dolphins use the same technique to\
 find their dinners. It’s called echolocation, a technique that uses sound to identify objects\
 (line 5) by the echoes they produce.\
 Fourteen-year-old Ben Underwood of Sacramento, Calif., is one of the few people\
 known to use echolocation as a primary means of navigating the world on land. There’s\
 not even a hint of light reaching his brain. His eyes are artificial, but his brain has adapted\
 to allow him to appraise his environment. He makes a “clicking” sound to communicate\
 (line 10) with objects and people around him.\
 Scientists have discovered that in the brains of the blind, the visual cortex has not\
 become useless, as they once believed. When blind people use another sense—touch or\
 hearing, for example—to substitute for sight, the brain’s visual cortex becomes active, even\
 though no images reach it from the optic nerve. Echolocation creates its own images.\
 (line 15) “I can hear that wall behind you over there. I can hear right there—the radio, and the\
 fan,” Ben says.\
 Ben says every object in his life talks to him in ways that no one else can hear\
 or understand.\
 Forty-year-old Daniel Kish of Long Beach, Calif., also uses echolocation, and has\
 (line 20) become an expert on it, founding the World Access for the Blind, an organization that\
 teaches others how to echolocate. Kish leads other blind people on mountain biking tours\
 and hikes in the wilderness, visualizing and describing the picturesque sights around him\
 through echolocating.\
 Clicking to Do Anything\
 If you listen closely to Ben or Kish, you can hear how they find their way. Ben says he\
 (line 25) can distinguish where the curbs are as he cruises his neighborhood streets.\
 He can find the pole and the backboard on a basketball goal, and tell which is which\
 by the distinctive echo each makes. Even though he can’t see the goal he’s aiming for, he\
 can sink a basket. Ben doesn’t remember how or when he began clicking, but he’s\
 developed his abilities to such an extent that aside from echolocation, he can rapidly\
 (line 30) discriminate the sounds in video games.\
 Ben lost his sight when he was 2. He was diagnosed with cancer in both eyes, and\
 when chemotherapy failed, his mother, Aquanetta Gordon, was left with one option: For\
 her son to live, both his eyes had to be surgically removed.\
 Gordon remembers her son after the operation.\
 (line 35) “He woke up and he said, ‘Mom, I can’t see anymore, I can’t see anymore.’ And I took\
 his hands and I put them on my face and I said, ‘Baby, yes, you can see.’ I said, ‘You can\
 see with your hands.’ And then I put my hand on his nose and I said, ‘You smell me? You\
 can see with your nose and your ears. . . . You can’t use your eyes anymore, but you have\
 your hands and your nose and your ears.’ ”\
 (line 40) In a house already filled with three other children, Ben’s mother decided not to treat\
 his blindness as a handicap. In school, Ben recognizes his classmates by their voices. With\
 the help of Braille books and a talking laptop computer, Ben attends the same classes as\
 sighted students.\
 Rich Mental Images, Without Visual Elements\
 Like Ben, Kish also lost his eyesight to cancer at age 1. He was raised to believe he\
 (line 45) could do pretty much anything, and he discovered clicking by accident as a child.\
 “I have mental images that are very rich, very complex. They simply do not possess\
 the visual element,” Kish says.\
 In retrieving those pictures, Kish varies the pace and volume of his clicks as he\
 walks along; and what he can tell you about an object’s qualities is sometimes\
 (line 50) astonishingly thorough.\
 If bats can distinguish prey as small as mosquitoes with echolocation, and some\
 dolphins can detect small targets a hundred yards away, what are the ultimate capabilities\
 of human beings like Ben and Kish?\
 Peter Scheifele, who studies hearing and sound production in animals and people at\
 (line 55) the University of Connecticut, analyzed samples of the clicks that Ben and Kish make.\
 “Ben clicks, looks to me like once every half second, whereas a dolphin is actually\
 making 900 clicks per second. And the bat is even faster than that,” Scheifele says.\
 The bottom line: Human beings send out sounds at much slower rates and lower\
 frequencies, so the objects people can picture with echolocation must be much larger than\
 (line 60) the ones bats and dolphins can find.\
In people who are blind, the visual cortex seems to help\
(A) activate the optic nerve where images are formed\
 (B) increase the amount of light reaching the brain\
 (C) create images in the brain based on sounds\
 (D) make echoes of sounds from clicks\

Description of the experiences of Deng Yingchao, a young Chinese woman during the protests of 1919\
 \
 When the May Fourth Movement took place in 1919, I was only sixteen years old, a student at the Tianjin Women’s Normal College. . . . On May 4, 1919, students in Beijing held a demonstration asking the government to refuse to sign the Versailles Peace Treaty and to punish the traitors at home. In their indignation [displeasure], they burned the house at Zhaojialou and beat up Lu Zhongxiang, then Chinese envoy to Japan. The following day, when the news reached Tianjin, it aroused the indignation of students there who staged their own demonstration on May 7th. Theybegan by organizing such patriotic societies as the Tianjin  Student Union, the Tianjin Women’s Patriotic Society, and the Tianjin Association of National Salvation. We had no political theory to guide us at that time, only our strong patriotic enthusiasm. In addition to the Beijing students’ requests, we demanded, “Abrogate [reject] the Twenty-One Demands!” “Boycott Japanese Goods!” and “Buy Chinese-made goods!” Furthermore, we emphatically refused to become slaves to foreign powers!. . .\

 Excerpt from Waste Not, Want Not\
 by Teresa Bateman\
 \
 (paragraph 1) My mother believed in using things up. We always squeezed the toothpaste tube until it was as sharp as a razor, and we cleaned our plates, even when it was liver-andonions\
 night. . . .\
 \
 (paragraph 2) Mom’s frugality was legendary. She could make one chicken come back in a dozen meals as variously disguised leftovers. Her favorite saying was “waste not, want not.” Josh and I weren’t sure what that meant, but it probably explained why Mom was into recycling long before it became popular. It also explained why the “Affair of the Hat,” as it later became known, was so strange.\
 \
 (paragraph 3) The Hat deserved capital letters. It was about three feet across, made of green straw and covered with big plastic daisies, two red peonies, and an orange bow. I might have said it was “dog ugly,” except that wouldn’t sit well with our dog, Mutt.\
 \
 (paragraph 4) Great-aunt Marjorie had given The Hat to Mother on one of her visits to our farm. It was supposed to keep the sun off Mother’s delicate complexion while enhancing her rural beauty (whatever that meant). . . .\
 \
 (paragraph 5) When Aunt Marjorie returned to the city, Josh and I held our breath to see what would happen to The Hat. We could see that Mom’s thrifty nature and fashion sense were in pitched battle. She couldn’t justify throwing The Hat away—it was nearly new and had a lot of use left in it—but neither could she stomach wearing it. She tried pulling off the daisies and peonies, but they were stuck on tight, as were the perky orange ribbons that held The Hat in place. She’d have to find some other solution.\
 \
 (paragraph 6) One day Josh and I came down to breakfast and noticed that The Hat was missing from the hook by the door. We looked at each other, then scouted the house. It wasn’t hard to spot. Mother had installed it in the parlor as a lampshade.\
 \
 (paragraph 7) Our parakeet, Pete, chirped inquiringly from his cage as Josh and I decided to see how The Hat looked in full lampshade glory. We pulled the chain.\
 \
 (paragraph 8 ) Pete tweeted once, then dropped like a stone from his perch. We ran to his cage, and Josh suggested mouth-to-beak resuscitation. Then we glanced over at the lamp. The light shining through the peonies made them look like two big red eyes glaring at you. No wonder Pete had fainted. We plucked The Hat from the lamp and went to tell Mom. Reluctantly she hung it back up on the hook by the door. . . .\
 \
 (paragraph 9) The next morning she headed out the door, The Hat filled to the brim with turkey feed. Josh and I watched as Mother approached the turkeys scavenging in the barnyard. The minute those turkeys sighted The Hat, they ran gobbling toward the barn door and dived in a panic into the haystack. Mom dumped the turkey feed in the barnyard and\
 walked back to the house, her shoulders drooping. . . .\
 \
 (paragraph 10) She threw The Hat to the floor, raised her foot, and screamed, “THIS HAT IS FOR THE BIRDS!” Josh and I stepped back, waiting for her foot to come crashing down.\
 \
 (paragraph 11) “It is not for the birds,” Josh blurted. \"They hate it!”\
 \
 (paragraph 12) It was as though time stood still. Then we heard a strange sound. Mother was laughing!\
 \
 (paragraph 13) We shook our heads. She’d finally gone over the edge—there she stood, one foot in the air, laughing like a hysterical flamingo.\
 \
 (paragraph 14) Then she put her foot down . . . on the floor. She picked up The Hat and headed upstairs where we heard boxes being shuffled around in the attic. . .\
 \
 (paragraph 15) When she came down, she was dragging a body. It was wearing Grandpa’s old overalls, Uncle Paul’s flannel shirt, and the shoes Josh had outgrown last year. Its head was a flour sack, stuffed full of straw from an old tick, and on that head perched The Hat.\
 \
 tick = mattress\
 \
 (paragraph 16) Mom hauled the stuffed body outside and set it up on a post in the middle of the cornfield. And that’s where it stayed.\
 \
 (paragraph 17) Our corn crop that year was particularly good. For some reason the birds steered clear of our fields and raided the neighbors’ instead. Maybe it had something to do with our scarecrow, I don’t know. All I do know is that from then on, we rarely saw crows on our property except during the month of June.\
 \
 (paragraph 16) That’s when Great-aunt Marjorie comes to visit.\
What can the reader infer from the details in paragraphs 17 and 18 of the story?\
(A) Mother worries that the crows will stop being afraid of The Hat and changes to a new hat every June.\
 (B) Mother is concerned about the crows and gives them one month each year\
 to eat what is in the cornfield.\
 (C) Mother spends each June enjoying time with Aunt Marjorie and does not do much work in the cornfield.\
 (D) Mother removes The Hat from the cornfield in June so that Aunt Marjorie’s feelings will not be hurt.\

 \
 Address Given by President Harry Truman to a Joint Session of Congress on March 12, 1947\
 \
 . . The peoples of a number of countries of the world have recently had totalitarian regimes forced upon them against their will. The Government of the United States has made frequent protests against coercion [persuasion] and intimidation, in violation of the Yalta agreement, in Poland, Rumania, and Bulgaria. I must also state that in a number of other countries there have been similar developments.\
    At the present moment in world history nearly every nation must choose between alternative ways of life. The choice is too often not a free one. . . .\
    I believe that it must be the policy of the United States to support free peoples who are resisting attempted subjugation [oppression] by armed minorities or by outside pressures.\
    I believe that we must assist free peoples to work out their own destinies in their own way. . . .\

Excerpt from One-Eyed Cat\
 by Paula Fox\
 \
 Ned loved snow, the whisper when he walked through it, a sound like candles being\
 blown out, the coming indoors out of it into the warmth, and standing on the register in\
 the big hall through which the dusty, metal-smelling heat blew up, and the going back out\
 again, shivering, cold, stooping and scooping up a handful to make a snowball, packing it\
 (line 5) hard with wet mittens, hefting it, tossing it as far as he could, and the runners of his sled\
 whispering across it as he sleighed down the slopes which were smooth and glittering and\
 hard, like great jewels.\
 On the first of December, there was a heavy snowfall. When Ned looked out of his\
 window the next morning, the river glowed like a snake made out of light as it wound\
 (line 10) among the snow-covered mountains.\
 He ate breakfast hastily, too preoccupied to read the story on the cereal box.\
 Mrs. Scallop (Mrs. Scallop: Ned’s family’s housekeeper) was broody this morning and left him a lone, her glance passing over him as\
 it passed over the kitchen chairs.\
 On the porch, he paused to take deep breaths of air which tasted, he imagined, like\
 (line 15) water from the center of the ocean, then he waded into the snow, passing the Packard (Packard: a brand of car that is no longer manufactured), its\
 windows white and hidden, the crabapple tree with its weighted branches, down the long\
 hill trying to guess if he was anywhere near the buried driveway. By the time he reached\
 Mr. Scully’s house, his galoshes were topped with snow and his feet were wet. Mr. Scully’s\
 shades were drawn; the house had a pinched look as though it felt the cold.\
 (line 20) Ned went around to the back until he could see the shed. There were boot tracks in\
 the snow leading to it and returning to the back door. He guessed the old man had taken\
 in the cat’s bowl; it was nowhere to be seen. You couldn’t leave anything out in this\
 weather, it would freeze. Mr. Scully had told him that finding water in the winter was a\
 big problem for animals. Licking the snow or ice could make them sick.\
 (line 25) Ned stared hard at the shed. Perhaps the cat was inside, squeezed in behind logs in a\
 tight space where its own breath would keep it warm. He was going to be late to school if\
 he didn’t get a move on, but he kept looking hard all over the yard as though he could\
 make the cat appear out of snow and gray sky. Twice, his glance passed over the icebox.\
 The third time, he saw that the motionless mound on top of it was not only the quilt but\
 (line 30) the cat, joined into one shape by a dusting of snow.\
 Ned held his breath for a moment, then put his own feet in Mr. Scully’s tracks and\
 went toward the shed. The tracks had frozen and they crunched under Ned’s weight, but\
 the cat didn’t raise its head. Ned halted a few feet away from it—but of course, he realized,\
 it wouldn’t hear him because of its deaf ear. He could have gone closer to it than he’d ever\
 (line 35) been but he had a sudden vision of the cat exploding into fear when it finally did\
 hear him.\
 When he got back to the front of the house, he saw fresh footsteps on the road. He\
 could tell it was the road because of the deep ditches which fell away to either side. He\
 guessed they were Billy’s tracks. It was odd to think that Billy, huffing and puffing, had\
 (line 40) gone past Mr. Scully’s place, thinking his own thoughts, while he, Ned, only a few yards\
 away, had been searching for the cat. He found Evelyn’s tracks, too, and later on, Janet’s,\
 the smallest of all. He felt ghostly as if he’d been left alone on a white, silent globe.\
 Somewhere in the evergreen woods, snow must have slid off a bough, for he heard the\
 loud plop, then the fainter sound of the bough springing up, relieved of the weight. He\
 (line 45) thought about the cat, visualizing how it had looked on the quilt. How still it had been!\
 Why hadn’t he gone right up to it, looked at it close, touched its fur? Why had it been so\
 motionless—still as death, still as a dead vole he’d seen last summer in the grass near the\
 well? He came to the snow-covered blacktop road upon which a few cars had left their\
 ridged tire tracks. He had a strong impulse to turn back, to play hooky for the first time in\
 (line 50) his life. Mr. Scully, with his poor eyesight, might not spot the cat on top of the icebox,\
 might not, then, set food out for it. Fretting and shivering, his feet numb, Ned went on\
 to school.\
 He tried very hard to concentrate on his lessons, to watch Miss Jefferson’s plump, even\
 handwriting on the blackboard as she wrote out the lines from a poem by Thomas Gray\
 (line 55) that the class was to memorize that week, but try as he might, the image of the unmoving\
 animal on the ragged old quilt persisted. Last week, on a rainy afternoon, the cat had\
 looked at Ned, had cocked its head as though to see him better. Its one eye, narrowed, had\
 reminded him of a grain of wheat.\
 “The curfew tolls the knell of parting day,\
 (line 60) The lowing herd wind slowly o’er the lea . . .”\
 Ned read the lines several times before copying them down in his copybook. The\
 words made no sense to him. It was this that had made his hours in school so hard ever\
 since he and Mr. Scully had seen the cat last autumn, this drawing away of his attention\
 from everything that was going on around him. He was either relieved because the cat was\
 (line 65) where he could see it or fearful because he didn’t know where it was.\

This story takes place in Japan. The narrator has just rented a new home on a small street named Lightning Alley.\
 \
 Excerpt from The Guest Cat\
 \
 by Takashi Hiraide\
 \
 (paragraph 1) The cat’s name was Chibi, which means “little one.” We could hear the boy’s particularly high-pitched voice calling the cat: “Chibi!” Then we’d hear the sound of the boy’s shoes running around outside, followed by the tinkling of the little bell announcing the cat’s arrival.\
 \
 (paragraph 2) Chibi was a jewel of a cat. Her pure white fur was mottled with several lampblack blotches containing just a bit of light brown. The sort of cat you might see just about anywhere in Japan, except she was especially slim and tiny.\
 \
 (paragraph 3) These were her individual characteristics—slim and small, with ears that stood out, tapering off beautifully at the tips, and often twitching. She would approach silently and undetected to rub up against one’s legs. At first I thought Chibi avoided me because I was not used to cats, but this seems not to have been the case. When a girl who often passed along Lightning Alley stopped and crouched to gaze at the cat, it did not run away. But as soon as she attempted to touch it, the cat quickly slipped off, avoiding contact at all costs. The cat’s manner of rejection was like cold, white light.\
 \
 (paragraph 4) Moreover, the cat rarely made a sound. As far as I remember, when it first appeared in the alley it made some sort of sound, but since then it had never let out a meow. It looked as if no matter how much time passed the cat was not going to let us hear its\
 voice. This seemed to be the message the cat was giving us.\
 \
 (paragraph 5) Another one of Chibi’s characteristics was that she changed the direction of her cautious attention frequently. This active behavior wasn’t limited to her kittenhood. Perhaps because she played alone most of the time in the expansive garden, she reacted strongly to insects and reptiles. And there were times when I could only conclude that she must be reacting to subtle changes in the wind and light, not detectable by humans. It may be that most cats share the same quickness, but even so, in Chibi’s case, it was acute—she was, after all, the cat of Lightning Alley. My wife got into the habit of pointing to the cat whenever it went by, extolling (extolling - praising) its virtues. . . .\
 \
 (paragraph 6) Chibi, who loved to play ball, gradually began to visit us on her own and would try and get us to play with her. She would step gingerly into the room and gaze intently at its occupants, then purposefully turn around and walk back out, as if to lead us to the garden. This process would be repeated until she got a response. Most of the time my wife would put down whatever she was doing, slip happily into her sandals and head outside.\
 \
 (paragraph 7) Having played to her heart’s content, Chibi would come inside and rest for a while. When she began to sleep on the sofa—like a talisman (talisman - an object thought to bring good luck) curled gently in the shape of a comma and dug up from a prehistoric archaeological site—a deep sense of happiness arrived, as if the house itself had dreamed this scene.\
 \
 (paragraph 8) Avoiding the prying eyes of the landlady, we began leaving it up to Chibi to come inside the house whenever she wanted—and with this new development I had begun little by little to understand cat lovers. Whether on TV or in all of the ubiquitous (ubiquitous - present everywhere) cat calendars, it seemed as if there was no cat comparable to her. But, though I had started to think of her as the best cat around, she was not really our cat.\
 \
 (paragraph 9) First we would hear the tinkling of the bell, and then she would appear, so we began to call her by the nickname “Tinkerbell.” Whenever we wanted her to come over, this name seemed to find itself on our lips.\
 \
 (paragraph 10) “I wonder where Tinkerbell is.” By the time my wife had gotten the words out of her mouth we’d hear the tinkling of Chibi’s bell. We’d realize that she was near at the point where, exiting the foyer next door (located at the second corner of Lightning Alley), Chibi would leap through the tear in the wire-mesh boundary of the property, dash along the side of the building, turn at the far end of the veranda, leap up onto the open area of the deck, and then, placing her front paws on the window frame at about the height of a human adult’s knee, stretch out her neck to peek inside.\
 \
 (paragraph 11) In winter she came inside. Little by little, through the crack in the partially opened window, her tendency to visit subtly developed; her appearances were repeated until, as if a silken opening in a fabric had been continuously moistened and stretched, Chibi had entered our lives. But at the same time—call it fate if you will—something else was closing in and pressing itself against that tendency.\
What does the phrase “cold, white light” in paragraph 3 suggest about Chibi?\
(A) She prefers to be outdoors during the day.\
 (B) She demands fast responses from humans.\
 (C) She struggles to survive outside in the winter.\
 (D) She is indifferent to the feelings of humans.\

Passage A\
 \
 . . . I wish to go to my own words during my trial in 1964. They are as true today as they were then. I wrote: I have fought against white domination, and I have fought against black domination. I have cherished the idea of a democratic and free society in which all persons live together in harmony and with equal opportunities.\
 \
 It is an ideal which I hope to live for and to achieve. But if needs be, it is an ideal for which I am prepared to die. . . . My friends, I have no words of eloquence to offer today except to say that the remaining days of my life are in your hands. I hope you will disperse with discipline. And not a single one of you should do anything which will make other people to say that we can’t control our own people.\

 Passage B\
 \
 . . . Our country and all its people have been embroiled [involved] in conflict, tension and violent struggle for decades. It is time for us to break out of the cycle of violence and break through to peace and reconciliation. The silent majority is yearning for this. The youth deserve it.\
 \
 With the steps the Government has taken it has proven its good faith and the table is laid for sensible leaders to begin talking about a new dispensation [direction], to reach an understanding by way of dialogue and discussion. \
 \
 The agenda is open and the overall aims to which we are aspiring should be acceptable to all reasonable South Africans.\
 \
 Among other things, those aims include a new, democratic constitution; universal franchise [vote]; no domination; equality before an independent judiciary; the protection of minorities as well as of individual rights; freedom of religion; a sound economy based on proven economic principles and private enterprise; dynamic programmes directed at better education, health services, housing and social conditions for all. . . .\

 Anabolic Steroids\
    Anabolic steroids are hormones that affect muscle growth. Many athletes take synthetic anabolic steroids, in hopes of developing larger muscles so they can perform better at their sport. These hormones can act like the hormone testosterone. When men take an excess of anabolic steroids, they can have an increase in feminine features. This is due to the fact that the excess of these chemicals signals the male body to stop producing testosterone.\
One reason why anabolic steroids can imitate the hormone testosterone is because\
(1) anabolic steroids and testosterone both interact with the same cell receptors\
 (2) testosterone acts only on muscle cells\
 (3) females produce small amounts of the hormone testosterone\
 (4) an increase in testosterone in males using anabolic steroids increases male features\

Description of the experiences of Deng Yingchao, a young Chinese woman during the protests of 1919\
 \
 When the May Fourth Movement took place in 1919, I was only sixteen years old, a student at the Tianjin Women’s Normal College. . . . On May 4, 1919, students in Beijing held a demonstration asking the government to refuse to sign the Versailles Peace Treaty and to punish the traitors at home. In their indignation [displeasure], they burned the house at Zhaojialou and beat up Lu Zhongxiang, then Chinese envoy to Japan. The following day, when the news reached Tianjin, it aroused the indignation of students there who staged their own demonstration on May 7th. Theybegan by organizing such patriotic societies as the Tianjin  Student Union, the Tianjin Women’s Patriotic Society, and the Tianjin Association of National Salvation. We had no political theory to guide us at that time, only our strong patriotic enthusiasm.

Excerpt from Wheels of Change: How Women Rode the Bicycle to Freedom (With a Few Flat Tires Along the Way)\
 \
 by Sue Macy\
 \
 (paragraph 1) Women’s rights crusader Elizabeth Cady Stanton was in her eighties during the heyday of the bicycle, and no evidence exists to show that she actually ever rode one. But there was no better or more eloquent advocate for women and the wheel. In 1895, Stanton contributed an article to the American Wheelman celebrating this “wonderful new style of locomotion.” In the article, titled “The Era of the Bicycle,” she pointed out that cycling was increasing people’s mobility, eliminating the cost of feeding and housing horses, and encouraging the building of good roads. However, she saved her greatest praise for the bicycle’s effects on women. “The bicycle,” she wrote, “will inspire women with more courage, self-respect and self-reliance and make the next generation more vigorous of mind and of body; for feeble mothers do not produce great statesmen, scientists and scholars.”\
 \
 (paragraph 2) For all the practical benefits of the two-wheeler, the fact is that it brought about a cosmic shift in women’s private and public lives. With the rise of industry and the move from a rural to an urban economy in the 19th century, American women had become increasingly confined to their homes. Young girls could play outside, but when they matured, their freedom of movement was greatly restricted. “At sixteen years of age, I was enwrapped in the long skirts that impeded every footstep,” remembered Frances Willard, who in 1895 wrote a best-selling account of how she learned to ride abicycle at age 53. “I have detested walking and felt with a certain noble disdain that the conventions of life had cut me off from what . . . had been one of life’s sweetest joys.”\
 \
 (paragraph 3) While wealthier women were saddled with long skirts and restrictive corsets, those who were less well off worked anonymously in mills and factories. All in all, the result was the same. Except in a few instances, the public image of America was male. Politicians, soldiers, business leaders, and even the leading athletes in the new sports of baseball and football were all men. But the bicycle changed that. Suddenly, women were leaving their homes to cycle and socialize on country roads and city streets. Bicycle racers such as Louise Armaindo and Frankie Nelson had their exploits splashed all over the papers. Bicycle manufacturers, intent on mining an untapped market, showed female models in their advertisements. Thanks to the wheel, women were starting to be seen and heard in public life.\
 \
 (paragraph 4) It was not a stretch for some cyclists to see the possibility of a larger role for women in the world. When she conquered the wheel, Frances Willard was a former university president and the longtime president of the Woman’s Christian Temperance Union, which fought to prohibit the use of alcoholic beverages and to win women the right to vote. Willard saw parallels between learning to ride and learning to live. “I began to feel that myself plus the bicycle equaled myself plus the world, upon whose spinning wheel we must all learn to ride,” she wrote. “He who succeeds, or, to be more exact in handing over my experience, she who succeeds in gaining the mastery of [a bicycle], will gain the mastery of life.”\
 \
 (paragraph 5) For decades, Willard, along with Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Susan B. Anthony, and many others, had been working toward increased political and economic rights for women. Now the bicycle brought a taste of independence to women on a very personal level, and some of them took the opportunity to express their discontent with old traditions and expectations. In August 1895, a cyclist named Ann Strong caused a stir when she compared the value of a bicycle to that of a husband in the Minneapolis Tribune. “I can’t see but that a wheel is just as good company as most husbands,” she declared. “I would as lief (lief - happily) talk to one inanimate object as another; and I’d a great deal rather talk to one that can’t answer than one that won’t.” Strong then contrasted the joy of cycling with the challenges of raising a family. “You can make your wheel tidy over night,” she said, “and it never kicks off its shoes the very last minute, and never smears itself with molasses. When you are ready you can start. No little elbows are stuck in your ribs; there is no wiggling; screams at the cars or at the candy stores. You glide along, silently, smoothly, swiftly.”\
 \
 (paragraph 6) Some stated the liberating effects of the bicycle with less sarcasm. “The bicycle has brought to women a healthful, wholesome means of securing a degree of freedom and independence that no amount of discussion regarding ‘women’s rights’ would ever have produced,” wrote the L.A.W. Bulletin and Good Roads magazine in 1898. Meanwhile, Munsey’s Magazine assessed the impact of the wheel on women in a special bicycle-themed issue. “If she has ridden her bicycle into new fields, becoming in the process a new creature, it has been gradually and unconsciously,” the editors wrote.\
 \
 (paragraph 7) “She did not have to be born again in some mysterious fashion, becoming a strange creature, a ‘new woman.’ She is more like the ‘eternal feminine,’ who has taken on wings, and who is using them with an ever increasing delight in her new power.” Indeed, many bicycle companies at home and abroad did put wings on the women in their advertisements, emphasizing that they had taken flight.\
 \
 (paragraph 8) Not all publications treated the emergence of the “new woman” with the same level of approval. Some mocked her, while others just seemed baffled by her. Her new way of dressing, in bloomers or divided skirts or skirts with shortened hems, certainly disturbed the old social order, but so did her confidence and daring. These traits led commentators to worry that the differences between the sexes were being blurred, a fear that was reinforced as the four newest states—Wyoming, Colorado, Utah, and Idaho—granted women the right to vote in the 1890s. Would the bicycle help bring about a new kind of equality between men and women? Elizabeth Cady Stanton and her colleagues certainly hoped so. At any rate, the image of a female cyclist quickly became associated with efforts to win more rights for women.\
As it relates to the information in the article, what does “With a Few Flat Tires Along the Way” in the title suggest?\
(A) Women rode bicycles along rough and unpaved roads.\
 (B) Women encountered resistance to their efforts.\
 (C) Women had a difficult time learning to ride bicycles.\
 (D) Women were unused to dealing with mechanical issues.\

Excerpt from A la Carte\
 by Tanita S. Davis\
 \
 (paragraph 1) “Homework?” My mother mouths the word exaggeratedly, eyebrows raised, and I\
 roll my eyes. Frowning, she points with her chin to the side door that leads to the stairs.\
 I roll my eyes again, mouthing, Okay, okay, not needing her to pantomime further what\
 she wants me to do. I hate the thought of leaving the clattering nerve center of the\
 restaurant to wrestle with my trigonometry homework in my mother’s quiet office\
 downstairs.\
 (paragraph 2) \"Order!\"\
 (paragraph 3) The bright lights and swirl of noise and motion are muffled as the kitchen door\
 swings closed behind me.\
 (paragraph 4) It’s hard to remember a time when the restaurant hasn’t been the center of our lives.\
 Mom used to be a copy editor and wrote food features for our local paper, the Clarion,\
 and she met Pia when she did a write-up on the culinary school Pia attended. Pia\
 thinks it was fate that Mom wanted to invest in a restaurant at the same time Pia\
 wanted to buy the old bank building.\
 (paragraph 5) La Salle Rouge doesn’t serve much in the way of “kid” food, since the menu doesn’t\
 cater to people my age on a cheap date, but I’ve loved everything about it from the first.\
 I started experimenting with being a vegetarian when I turned fourteen, but Pia still\
 found things to feed me and taught me to be creative with vegetables and tofu. I like to\
 think I’m the best-fed vegetarian in the state of California.\
 (paragraph 6) Pia’s been really good about teaching what she knows, and I decided early on that\
 this is the work I want to do—get out of school and get into the kitchen for good. Mom\
 and Pia have created a popular French-Asian-Californian fusion restaurant that has\
 gotten great reviews from food critics. They took the best of each other’s tastes—\
 Mom’s traditional Southern flavors and Pia’s French training combined with her\
 vegetable- and spice-savvy Cambodian tastes—and pulled off what one food critic\
 called “stylized food with unique flavor combinations in an intimate setting.”\
 (paragraph 7) Whatever that means.\
 (paragraph 8) Three years ago, when I started high school thirty pounds heavier than everyone in\
 my class, Mom and I came up with a light menu for La Salle Rouge, and it’s been such a\
 popular idea that Mom lets me come up with tasty, low-calorie desserts, which is one of\
 my favorite things to do. It hardly seems fair that I have to walk away from all of that\
 just to do trigonometry, but my mom says I have to finish school before I concentrate\
 on cooking. She says it’s smarter to have a “backup plan,” and she’s made me apply to\
 plenty of colleges and check out business majors just in case I ever want to do anything\
 else with my life. I guess that makes sense if you’re anybody other than me. When I\
 turn eighteen, I already know what I’m going to do.\
 (paragraph 9) First, I’m going to buy a plane ticket to D.C. and go to Julia Child’s kitchen at the\
 Smithsonian and leave roses. They don’t let you walk through it, but somewhere—I\
 don’t know where—I’m going to leave a bouquet and a little note for her. Julia Child is\
 my patron saint (patron saint: an inspiring person admired for his or her work). She’s the queen of all reasons people can do anything they want in\
 life. Saint Julia didn’t start cooking until she was practically forty, and she went on to\
 do TV shows and make cookbooks and be this huge part of culinary history. She never\
 got too fancy, she never freaked out, and she was never afraid to try new things. I want\
 to be just like her—except maybe get famous faster.\
 (paragraph 10) The second thing I’m going to do is buy myself a set of knives. Pia swears by this set\
 of German steel knives she got when she graduated, but I’ve seen the TV chef Kylie\
 Kwong use a phenomenal-looking ceramic knife on her show on the Discovery\
 Channel. Either way, knives are what the best chefs have of their very own.\
 (paragraph 11) The third thing I’m going to do, after I get back from Washington and get my knives,\
 is . . . get discovered. Somehow. I know I’m going to have to pay my dues, but I’m so\
 ready for my real life to start. It’s not something I admit to a lot, but my real dream is to\
 be a celebrity chef. Do you know how many African American female chefs there\
 aren’t? And how many vegetarian chefs have their own shows? The field is wide open\
 for stardom. Every time I watch old episodes of Saint Julia, I imagine that I have my\
 own cooking show. The way celebrity chefs do it now, I could also have a line of\
 cooking gear, cookbooks, aprons, the works. People would know my name, ask for my\
 autograph, and try my recipes. All I have to do is finish my trig homework and get back\
 into the kitchen.\
What does the statement “I know I’m going to have to pay my dues” (paragraph 11) show about the narrator’s attitude toward her plans?\
(A) She thinks the price of fame might be too high.\
 (B) She realizes success depends on more than setting a goal.\
 (C) She is highly motivated by the idea of becoming famous.\
 (D) She thinks becoming a celebrity chef requires only money.\

 Excerpt from The Midnight Fox\
 by Betsy Byars\
 (paragraph 1) I had just finished writing this letter and was waiting for a minute to see if I would think of anything to add when I looked up and saw the black fox.\
 (paragraph 2) I did not believe it for a minute. It was like my eyes were playing a trick or something, because I was just sort of staring across this field, thinking about my letter, and then in the distance, where the grass was very green, I saw a fox leaping over the crest of the field. The grass moved and the fox sprang toward the movement, and then, seeing that it was just the wind that had caused the grass to move, she ran straight for the grove of trees where I was sitting\
 (paragraph 3) It was so great that I wanted it to start over again, like you can turn movie film back and see yourself repeat some fine thing you have done, and I wanted to see the fox leaping over the grass again. In all my life I have never been so excited.\
 (paragraph 4) I did not move at all, but I could hear the paper in my hand shaking, and my heart seemed to have moved up in my body and got stuck in my throat.\
 (paragraph 5) The fox came straight toward the grove of trees. She wasn't afraid, and I knew she had not seen me against the tree. I stayed absolutely still even though I felt like jumping up and screaming, \"Aunt Millie! Uncle Fred! Come see this. It's a fox, a fox!\"\
 (paragraph 6) Her steps as she crossed the field were lighter and quicker than a cat's. As she came closer I could see that her black fur was tipped with white. It was as if it were midnight and the moon were shining on her fur, frosting it. The wind parted her fur as it changed directions. Suddenly she stopped. She was ten feet away now, and with the changing of the wind she had got my scent. She looked right at me.\
 (paragraph 7) I did not move for a moment and neither did she. Her head was cocked to one side, her tail curled up, her front left foot raised. In all my life I never saw anything like that fox standing there with her pale golden eyes on me and this great black fur being blown by the wind.\
 (paragraph 8) Suddenly her nose quivered. It was such a slight movement I almost didn't see it, and then her mouth opened and I could see the pink tip of her tongue. She turned. She still was not afraid, but with a bound that was lighter than the wind-it was as if she was being blown away over the field-she was gone.\
 (paragraph 9) Still I didn't move. I couldn't. I couldn't believe that I had really seen the fox.\
 (paragraph 10) I had seen foxes before in zoos, but I was always in such a great hurry to get on to the good stuff that I was saying stupid things like, \"I want to see the go-rilllllas\", and not once had I ever really looked at a fox. Still, I could never remember seeing a black fox, not even in a zoo.\
 (paragraph 11) Also, there was a great deal of difference between seeing an animal in the zoo in front of painted fake rocks and trees and seeing one natural and free in the woods. It was like seeing a kite on the floor and then, later, seeing one up in the sky where it was supposed to be, pulling at the wind.\
 (paragraph 12) I started to pick up my pencil and write as quickly as I could, \"P.S. Today I saw a black fox.\" But I didn't. This was the most exciting thing that had happened to me, and \"P.S. Today I saw a black fox\" made it nothing. \"So what else is happening?\" Petie Burkis would probably write back. I folded my letter, put it in an envelope, and sat there.\
 (paragraph 13) I thought about this old newspaper that my dad had had in his desk drawer for years. It was orange and the headline was just one word, very big, the letters about twelve inches high. WAR! And I mean it was awesome to see that word like that, because you knew it was a word that was going to change your whole life, the whole world even. And every time I would see that newspaper, even though I wasn't even born when it was printed, I couldn't say anything for a minute or two.\
 (paragraph 14) Well, this was the way I felt right then about the black fox. I thought about a newspaper with just one word for a headline, very big, very black letters, twelve inches high. FOX! And even that did not show how awesome it had really been to me.\
How are paragraphs 2 through 6 important to the structure of the story?\
(A) They describe the setting and the main characters.\
 (B) They describe an event that is later repeated.\
 (C) They explain why the fox is in the field.\
 (D) They introduce a problem into the plot.\

 Copy Cat\
 In February 2002, Cc - the first-ever cloned cat - was introduced to the public by researchers at Texas A&M University. The kitten had been born December 22, 2001, but announcement of the successful cloning was delayed until the animal had completed its shot series and its immune system was fully developed. In the cloning process, DNA [the nucleus] was transplanted from the 2-year-old donor mother cat into an egg cell whose nucleus had been removed. This embryo then was implanted into the surrogate mother cat. …\

Which statement represents an explanation for why it is necessary to remove the nucleus from the egg cell used during the cloning process?\
(1) If the egg cell nucleus remains in the cell, then there will be three copies of all cat chromosomes in the cloned cat.\
 (2) If the egg cell nucleus is not removed, it will be impossible to predict the color of the cloned cat.\
 (3) Removing the egg cell nucleus from the egg cell will cause the cell to become a body cell.\
 (4) If the egg cell nucleus is not removed, then the cloned cat will always develop into a male.\

Excerpt from Wheels of Change: How Women Rode the Bicycle to Freedom (With a Few Flat Tires Along the Way)\
 by Sue Macy\
 \
 (paragraph 1) Women’s rights crusader Elizabeth Cady Stanton was in her eighties during the\
 heyday of the bicycle, and no evidence exists to show that she actually ever rode one.\
 But there was no better or more eloquent advocate for women and the wheel. In 1895,\
 Stanton contributed an article to the American Wheelman celebrating this “wonderful\
 new style of locomotion.” In the article, titled “The Era of the Bicycle,” she pointed out\
 that cycling was increasing people’s mobility, eliminating the cost of feeding and\
 housing horses, and encouraging the building of good roads. However, she saved her\
 greatest praise for the bicycle’s effects on women. “The bicycle,” she wrote, “will inspire\
 women with more courage, self-respect and self-reliance and make the next generation\
 more vigorous of mind and of body; for feeble mothers do not produce great\
 statesmen, scientists and scholars.”\
 (paragraph 2) For all the practical benefits of the two-wheeler, the fact is that it brought about a\
 cosmic shift in women’s private and public lives. With the rise of industry and the\
 move from a rural to an urban economy in the 19th century, American women had\
 become increasingly confined to their homes. Young girls could play outside, but when\
 they matured, their freedom of movement was greatly restricted. “At sixteen years of\
 age, I was enwrapped in the long skirts that impeded every footstep,” remembered\
 Frances Willard, who in 1895 wrote a best-selling account of how she learned to ride a\
 bicycle at age 53. “I have detested walking and felt with a certain noble disdain that the\
 conventions of life had cut me off from what . . . had been one of life’s sweetest joys.”\
 (paragraph 3) While wealthier women were saddled with long skirts and restrictive corsets, those\
 who were less well off worked anonymously in mills and factories. All in all, the result\
 was the same. Except in a few instances, the public image of America was male.\
 Politicians, soldiers, business leaders, and even the leading athletes in the new sports of\
 baseball and football were all men. But the bicycle changed that. Suddenly, women\
 were leaving their homes to cycle and socialize on country roads and city streets.\
 Bicycle racers such as Louise Armaindo and Frankie Nelson had their exploits splashed\
 all over the papers. Bicycle manufacturers, intent on mining an untapped market,\
 showed female models in their advertisements. Thanks to the wheel, women were\
 starting to be seen and heard in public life.\
 (paragraph 4) It was not a stretch for some cyclists to see the possibility of a larger role for women\
 in the world. When she conquered the wheel, Frances Willard was a former university\
 president and the longtime president of the Woman’s Christian Temperance Union,\
 which fought to prohibit the use of alcoholic beverages and to win women the right to\
 vote. Willard saw parallels between learning to ride and learning to live. “I began to feel\
 that myself plus the bicycle equaled myself plus the world, upon whose spinning wheel\
 we must all learn to ride,” she wrote. “He who succeeds, or, to be more exact in handing\
 over my experience, she who succeeds in gaining the mastery of [a bicycle], will gain\
 the mastery of life.”\
 (paragraph 5) For decades, Willard, along with Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Susan B. Anthony, and\
 many others, had been working toward increased political and economic rights for\
 women. Now the bicycle brought a taste of independence to women on a very personal\
 level, and some of them took the opportunity to express their discontent with old\
 traditions and expectations. In August 1895, a cyclist named Ann Strong caused a stir\
 when she compared the value of a bicycle to that of a husband in the Minneapolis\
 Tribune. “I can’t see but that a wheel is just as good company as most husbands,” she\
 declared. “I would as lief (lief: happily) talk to one inanimate object as another; and I’d a great deal\
 rather talk to one that can’t answer than one that won’t.” Strong then contrasted the joy\
 of cycling with the challenges of raising a family. “You can make your wheel tidy over\
 night,” she said, “and it never kicks off its shoes the very last minute, and never smears\
 itself with molasses. When you are ready you can start. No little elbows are stuck in\
 your ribs; there is no wiggling; screams at the cars or at the candy stores. You glide\
 along, silently, smoothly, swiftly.”\
 (paragraph 6) Some stated the liberating effects of the bicycle with less sarcasm. “The bicycle has\
 brought to women a healthful, wholesome means of securing a degree of freedom and\
 independence that no amount of discussion regarding ‘women’s rights’ would ever\
 have produced,” wrote the L.A.W. Bulletin and Good Roads magazine in 1898.\
 Meanwhile, Munsey’s Magazine assessed the impact of the wheel on women in a\
 special bicycle-themed issue. “If she has ridden her bicycle into new fields, becoming in\
 the process a new creature, it has been gradually and unconsciously,” the editors wrote.\
 (paragraph 7) “She did not have to be born again in some mysterious fashion, becoming a strange\
 creature, a ‘new woman.’ She is more like the ‘eternal feminine,’ who has taken on\
 wings, and who is using them with an ever increasing delight in her new power.”\
 Indeed, many bicycle companies at home and abroad did put wings on the women in\
 their advertisements, emphasizing that they had taken flight.\
 (paragraph 8) Not all publications treated the emergence of the “new woman” with the same level\
 of approval. Some mocked her, while others just seemed baffled by her. Her new way of\
 dressing, in bloomers or divided skirts or skirts with shortened hems, certainly\
 disturbed the old social order, but so did her confidence and daring. These traits led\
 commentators to worry that the differences between the sexes were being blurred, a\
 fear that was reinforced as the four newest states—Wyoming, Colorado, Utah, and\
 Idaho—granted women the right to vote in the 1890s. Would the bicycle help bring\
 about a new kind of equality between men and women? Elizabeth Cady Stanton and\
 her colleagues certainly hoped so. At any rate, the image of a female cyclist quickly\
 became associated with efforts to win more rights for women.\
As it relates to the information in the article, what does “With a Few Flat Tires Along the Way” in the title suggest?\
(A) Women rode bicycles along rough and unpaved roads.\
 (B) Women encountered resistance to their efforts.\
 (C) Women had a difficult time learning to ride bicycles.\
 (D) Women were unused to dealing with mechanical issues.\

The quotations below are from Denys, a British officer serving in the British Indian Army in 1947, who was interviewed as part of the “Partition Voices” project.\
 \
 “We were fairly thin on the ground by August 1947. On Independence Day I was in Lahore making my way back to England. I remember people shaking my hand saying, ‘Thank you. Thank you for making us independent.’\
 \
 “The station was knee-deep in bodies. It was a terrible time. Trains coming from one direction full of dead Sikhs and Hindus – and trains coming from the other full of dead Muslims.\
 \
 “We all – sort of people like myself, British officers – felt Partition went through too fast. The whole thing was not thought through.\
 \
 “I think the British government of the day was anxious to get it done quickly. It was a great mistake.” \

Excerpt from A la Carte\
 by Tanita S. Davis\
 \
 (paragraph 1) “Homework?” My mother mouths the word exaggeratedly, eyebrows raised, and I\
 roll my eyes. Frowning, she points with her chin to the side door that leads to the stairs.\
 I roll my eyes again, mouthing, Okay, okay, not needing her to pantomime further what\
 she wants me to do. I hate the thought of leaving the clattering nerve center of the\
 restaurant to wrestle with my trigonometry homework in my mother’s quiet office\
 downstairs.\
 (paragraph 2) \"Order!\"\
 (paragraph 3) The bright lights and swirl of noise and motion are muffled as the kitchen door\
 swings closed behind me.\
 (paragraph 4) It’s hard to remember a time when the restaurant hasn’t been the center of our lives.\
 Mom used to be a copy editor and wrote food features for our local paper, the Clarion,\
 and she met Pia when she did a write-up on the culinary school Pia attended. Pia\
 thinks it was fate that Mom wanted to invest in a restaurant at the same time Pia\
 wanted to buy the old bank building.\
 (paragraph 5) La Salle Rouge doesn’t serve much in the way of “kid” food, since the menu doesn’t\
 cater to people my age on a cheap date, but I’ve loved everything about it from the first.\
 I started experimenting with being a vegetarian when I turned fourteen, but Pia still\
 found things to feed me and taught me to be creative with vegetables and tofu. I like to\
 think I’m the best-fed vegetarian in the state of California.\
 (paragraph 6) Pia’s been really good about teaching what she knows, and I decided early on that\
 this is the work I want to do—get out of school and get into the kitchen for good. Mom\
 and Pia have created a popular French-Asian-Californian fusion restaurant that has\
 gotten great reviews from food critics. They took the best of each other’s tastes—\
 Mom’s traditional Southern flavors and Pia’s French training combined with her\
 vegetable- and spice-savvy Cambodian tastes—and pulled off what one food critic\
 called “stylized food with unique flavor combinations in an intimate setting.”\
 (paragraph 7) Whatever that means.\
 (paragraph 8) Three years ago, when I started high school thirty pounds heavier than everyone in\
 my class, Mom and I came up with a light menu for La Salle Rouge, and it’s been such a\
 popular idea that Mom lets me come up with tasty, low-calorie desserts, which is one of\
 my favorite things to do. It hardly seems fair that I have to walk away from all of that\
 just to do trigonometry, but my mom says I have to finish school before I concentrate\
 on cooking. She says it’s smarter to have a “backup plan,” and she’s made me apply to\
 plenty of colleges and check out business majors just in case I ever want to do anything\
 else with my life. I guess that makes sense if you’re anybody other than me. When I\
 turn eighteen, I already know what I’m going to do.\
 (paragraph 9) First, I’m going to buy a plane ticket to D.C. and go to Julia Child’s kitchen at the\
 Smithsonian and leave roses. They don’t let you walk through it, but somewhere—I\
 don’t know where—I’m going to leave a bouquet and a little note for her. Julia Child is\
 my patron saint (patron saint: an inspiring person admired for his or her work). She’s the queen of all reasons people can do anything they want in\
 life. Saint Julia didn’t start cooking until she was practically forty, and she went on to\
 do TV shows and make cookbooks and be this huge part of culinary history. She never\
 got too fancy, she never freaked out, and she was never afraid to try new things. I want\
 to be just like her—except maybe get famous faster.\
 (paragraph 10) The second thing I’m going to do is buy myself a set of knives. Pia swears by this set\
 of German steel knives she got when she graduated, but I’ve seen the TV chef Kylie\
 Kwong use a phenomenal-looking ceramic knife on her show on the Discovery\
 Channel. Either way, knives are what the best chefs have of their very own.\
 (paragraph 11) The third thing I’m going to do, after I get back from Washington and get my knives,\
 is . . . get discovered. Somehow. I know I’m going to have to pay my dues, but I’m so\
 ready for my real life to start. It’s not something I admit to a lot, but my real dream is to\
 be a celebrity chef. Do you know how many African American female chefs there\
 aren’t? And how many vegetarian chefs have their own shows? The field is wide open\
 for stardom. Every time I watch old episodes of Saint Julia, I imagine that I have my\
 own cooking show. The way celebrity chefs do it now, I could also have a line of\
 cooking gear, cookbooks, aprons, the works. People would know my name, ask for my\
 autograph, and try my recipes. All I have to do is finish my trig homework and get back\
 into the kitchen.\
In paragraph 1, what does the phrase “clattering nerve center of the restaurant” suggest?\
(A) messiness, chaos\
 (B) energy, core\
 (C) tension, anxiety\
 (D) greatness, stability\

Excerpt from The Call of Coney Island\
 \
 by Cynthia Overbeck Bix\
 \
 (paragraph 1) Salty ocean smells mingle with the aromas of sweet cotton candy and Nathan’s Famous hot dogs. The legendary Cyclone roller coaster lurches along its tracks—then takes a heart-stopping plunge. Riders whoop and scream with excitement. Farther down the boardwalk, the sound of a carousel starts. Patrons pitch balls at moving targets, hoping to win a prize. Welcome to Coney Island, the nation’s first truly modern amusement area.\
 \
 (paragraph 2) Located on the southern tip of Brooklyn, New York, Coney Island has been the place to go for fun for more than a century. The inspiration for amusement parks such as Coney Island sprang from an exciting event in 1893—the World’s Columbian Exposition in Chicago. It was one of the first venues where people experienced a variety of attractions in one large space. \
 \
 (paragraph 3) Visitors to Chicago gasped in wonder when they saw the fair’s “White City” spread out before them. Beautiful all-white exhibition buildings and large classical statues framed a lagoon of shimmering water. Designed to educate and inform, about a dozen grand buildings housed displays on the latest developments in transportation, machinery, agriculture, art, horticulture, and more. Most visitors had never seen the things they saw there, such as electric lights, a moving sidewalk, world-famous artwork, and moving pictures.\
 \
 (paragraph 4) While the World’s Columbian Exposition awed people with new innovations and ideas, its most popular attraction was the Midway Plaisance. Located in a separate section of the exhibition grounds, the Midway was filled with entertainment: rides, food stands, and sideshows. People could get a taste of international cultures, for example, by riding a camel through the Streets of Cairo or strolling among the thatched huts of a South Sea village. Best of all, they could ride George Ferris’s giant spinning wheel. Rising 264 feet above the Midway, this engineering marvel became the star of the fair. It was a spectacular example of what the new age of machines made possible.\
 \
 (paragraph 5) One visitor, New York showman George C. Tilyou, immediately saw potential for this new form of entertainment. Tilyou owned property on Coney Island, which already was an established beach resort with hotels, bathhouses, and restaurants. It also featured an odd collection of sideshows, food vendors, fortunetellers, and more. Tilyou decided to build an enclosed amusement park there.\
 \
 (paragraph 6) In 1897, Tilyou opened Steeplechase Park. When he was unable to buy Ferris’s wheel, he had his own version built. For 25 cents, visitors could ride Tilyou’s wheel, enjoy the Scenic Railway, or climb into a “spaceship” for a Trip to the Moon. On the Steeplechase, wooden horses carried riders along a metal racetrack from a starting gate to a finish line.\
 \
 (paragraph 7) Steeplechase Park’s huge success was partly due to another invention—electric railways. The first electric trolley line had connected Manhattan Island and Coney Island in the mid-1800s. By the turn of the 20th century, an electric train offered an even faster way to carry more people wanting to escape from the hot, crowded city.\
 \
 (paragraph 8) In the late 1800s and early 1900s, most people worked long hours and six days a week in urban factories and shops. But for a nickel fare, a city worker could afford a day’s outing to a nearby park on Sundays. Recognizing the value of giving the working class access to day trips, trolley and train companies established parks that were located at the end of a line. Travelers disembarked to enjoy simple outdoor pleasures in picnic groves and swimming pools or beaches. Eventually, merry-go-rounds, penny arcades, (penny arcades - indoor area with amusements such as games and photo booths operated by placing a coin in a slot) and even small roller coasters were added. . . .\
 \
 (paragraph 9) Part sideshow, part circus, part theme park, Coney Island set an example for amusement parks. Attractions that are so familiar today—roller coasters, water rides, fun houses, Tunnels of Love—all got their start there.\
 \
 (paragraph 10) Many amusement parks closed during the Great Depression in the 1930s or during World War II (1939–1945). Coney Island has had its ups and downs, too. Over the decades, fires and age destroyed some of the original attractions. In 2012, Superstorm Sandy wrecked the boardwalk and many of the attractions.\
 \
 (paragraph 11) In spite of all that, Coney Island has survived, and it is still operating today. It continues to offer each new generation of kids (and their parents) a chance to escape to a special world of entertainment and thrills. And from New Jersey’s Wildwood Park to California’s Pacific Park and Florida’s Walt Disney World, other amusement and theme parks have taken their cues from Coney Island. They have grown to epic proportions in their efforts to offer a world full of fun.\
How did Tilyou’s visit to the World’s Columbian Exposition affect the property at Coney Island?\
(A) Tilyou was motivated to build a park with amusement rides.\
 (B) Tilyou brought George Ferris’s giant wheel to Coney Island.\
 (C) Tilyou created multiple attractions based on different themes.\
 (D) Tilyou decided to construct an electric railway to Coney Island.\

Excerpt from Gregor and the Sheep\
 by Toby Rosenstrauch\
 \
 (paragraph 1) In a valley in the highlands of Scotland, there once lived a young tenant farmer, Gregor, and his widowed mother. Although they worked hard, they could never accumulate enough money to buy the flock of sheep they longed to have, for their small parcel of land produced only modest amounts of oats and barley. To make matters worse, MacTavish, the owner of this and many other crofts, always found reasons not to pay the farmers all they had earned. . . .\
 \
 crofts = small farms\
 \
 (paragraph 2) When he opened the door each morning and looked out, he saw MacTavish’s house on top of a mountain, a magnificent stone mansion surrounded by red, pink, and violet rhododendrons. Gregor often climbed the slope and stood outside the iron gates, wondering what fine furnishings and delicious foods lay within. Neighbors claimed that MacTavish owned many houses and even kept a chest of gems under his bed. As Gregor, his mother, and their neighbors grew gaunt and pale with hard work and not enough food, they railed against MacTavish, who had swindled all of them at one time or another.\
 \
 swindled = cheated or tricked\
 \
 (paragraph 3) One day, as Gregor listened to the bagpipe music that drifted from the open windows of MacTavish’s mansion, he had an idea. That night, when his mother was asleep, he emptied the jug that held their money and counted it. After putting back a few coins for food, he put the rest in his pocket. The next morning, he hurried to the market, where he went from farmer to farmer, asking the prices of sheep for sale. Gregor found many handsome animals, but they were all too expensive. When he reached a stall with scrawny and sickly sheep, the owner beckoned to him. . . .\
 \
 (paragraph 4) Gregor shook his head and began to walk away. The man grabbed his sleeve and whispered in his ear, “This one will make her owner rich!” Gregor examined the old sheep with spindly legs and dirty, unkempt wool—the worst of the lot. “If she will make me rich,” said Gregor, “how is it that she has not done so for you?”\
 \
 (paragraph 5) The man paused, thinking. “I have not had her long enough!”\
 \
 (paragraph 6) “Nonsense,” said Gregor, but he gave the man his money and led the pitiful animal home.\
 \
 (paragraph 7) When his mother saw what he had bought with their money, she burst into tears. “My foolish son, what have you done? Now we will starve, and no one will help us!”\
 \
 (paragraph 8) “Do as I say, Mother, and we will be rich. I promise.”\
 \
 (paragraph 9) She wanted to believe him. Wiping her eyes with her ragged sleeve, she asked what he wanted her to do.\
 \
 (paragraph 10) “Go to market and tell everyone that your son has a sheep that will make whoever owns her rich,” said Gregor. . . .\
 \
 (paragraph 11) One morning, a carriage arrived. Two servants opened the door and a stout, welldressed gentleman emerged. His Tartan kilt was made of the finest wool, his ascot was pure silk, and his shoes had silver buckles. On his fat fingers were eight gold rings, and his pomaded hair glistened in the sun. It was MacTavish!\
 \
 Tartan kilt = traditional clothing worn by Scottish Highlanders\
 \
 ascot = a type of necktie\
 \
 (paragraph 12) Gregor bowed as if to royalty. MacTavish looked at him sternly. “I have come to rid you of the unfortunate sheep that everyone is talking about,” said MacTavish, opening his sporran. “I can pay your price and I will have her, even though she has done nothing for you, I see.” MacTavish sneered at Gregor.\
 \
 sporran = a small bag worn at the waist for holding personal items\
 \
 (paragraph 13) Gregor hugged Dear One. “I will not sell her to you!”\
 \
 (paragraph 14) ”At that, MacTavish, whose servants were helping him into his carriage, turned and marched back. “I will pay anything,” he said. “Name the price.”\
 \
 (paragraph 15) Gregor was ready. “That,” he said, pointing up to the mansion above them. “I will have the dwelling and everything in it—furniture, utensils, even the chest of gems under your bed.”\
 \
 (paragraph 16) “Done,” said MacTavish.\
 \
 (paragraph 17) The next day, Gregor and his mother moved into the mansion that had once belonged to MacTavish, and MacTavish brought Dear One to the market so that all might see he could indeed own anything he wanted. Then MacTavish and the sheep rode away in his carriage to another of his houses in a valley beyond the mountains.\
 \
 (paragraph 18) After months had passed and the sheep had done nothing to increase MacTavish’s riches, he realized he had been swindled. Furious beyond speech, he returned to the mansion, but Gregor would not open the gates.\
 \
 (paragraph 19) “I have been cheated!” shouted MacTavish.\
 \
 (paragraph 20) “You have not been cheated,” said Gregor. “I was the owner of the sheep, and she has made me rich, hasn’t she?”\
 \
 (paragraph 21) “Yes, but . . . ,” sputtered MacTavish.\
 \
 (paragraph 22) “Then you got what you paid for.” Gregor turned and walked away.\
 \
 (paragraph 23) Soon afterward, Gregor sold the chest of gems and bought the huge flock of sheep he and his mother had always wanted. He shared the rest of his fortune with the other poor families of the valley who had been cheated by MacTavish.\
Which sentence is true about Gregor and MacTavish?\
(A) MacTavish has a plan for how the sheep will make him rich, but Gregor does not.\
 (B) MacTavish wants to own big houses and many jewels, but Gregor does not.\
 (C) Gregor wants to move away to another land, but MacTavish does not.\
 (D) Gregor is generous with his family and his neighbors, but MacTavish is not.\

This excerpt is from a book about the history of the Hudson River.\
 \
 Excerpt from River of Dreams\
 \
 by Hudson Talbott\
 \
 (paragraph 1) By the twentieth century, New York City had long since reached its destiny of becoming the most powerful city in America. In less than 300 years it had grown from a tiny Dutch outpost in the wilderness to the business capital of the world. It was a city built on dreams.\
 \
 (paragraph 2) But it was made out of bricks and cement that had come from the banks of the Hudson. The river which had fed all those dreams was now fading into the background. New York didn’t seem to need the river anymore, except as a sewer. And that’s what it became.\
 \
 (paragraph 3) Industry on the river had made some New Yorkers filthy rich. But it had just made the river filthy. Garbage, factory waste, plant chemicals and the raw sewage of the cities and towns along its banks were dumped directly into the river. The water turned greenish brown, except by the GM plant, where it turned red or yellow or whatever color they were painting the cars that day.\
 \
 (paragraph 4) The fishing industry collapsed. The few fish that survived were too poisonous to eat. Smog from the factory smoke and dust from the cement plants blanketed the valley. And it was all legal.\
 \
 (paragraph 5) Most people don’t start out with dreams of polluting a river. But it was often the result of people chasing their dreams of wealth with little care of how they reached it. The Hudson Valley had always drawn them.\
 \
 (paragraph 6) But now there were other dreamers in the valley, with their own dreams of wealth. They dreamed of the wealth of wildlife in a healthy forest, the abundance of fish in oxygen-rich water, and the great fortune of living in a beautiful river valley.\
 \
 (paragraph 7) So perhaps it was a matter of time before the two types of dreamers would meet each other—in court.\
 \
 (paragraph 8) In 1963, Con Edison, New York City’s power company, proposed a plan for constructing the largest hydroelectric pumping station ever built. The plan called for carving out a gigantic hole in the side of majestic Storm King Mountain on the Hudson River.\
 \
 (paragraph 9) But then they met Franny Reese. Franny was a longtime valley resident with a simple point to make: the mountain could not speak for itself. If she didn’t speak for it, who would?\
 \
 (paragraph 10) Franny and a group of like-minded people founded Scenic Hudson and took on the power company in a landmark court case. Con Ed challenged the right of private citizens to participate, but the court sided with the citizens, in the ruling now known as the Scenic Hudson Decision.\
 \
 (paragraph 11) After dragging out the case for seventeen years, Con Ed finally gave up and Storm King survived unblemished. It was the beginning of the environmental movement in this country, and once again, the Hudson Valley was the birthplace.\
 \
 (paragraph 12) More and more people joined the movement as they realized how much difference each of us can make.\
 \
 (paragraph 13) The love of their land was still alive in the hearts of Americans, and now that it was aroused again, things began to change.\
 \
 (paragraph 14) Many new laws and new citizens’ groups have been inspired by those early heroes of the environment, and their work has begun to bring the Hudson back to life.\
 \
 (paragraph 15) The Mahicans called it “The River That Flows Both Ways.” Slowly we are learning that taking care of the river is the only way that the river can take care of us.\
 \
 (paragraph 16) Fifty years have passed since I dreamed of going to New York to see the river that shares my name, and thirty-five years since that dream came true. I live in the Hudson Valley now, grateful to all those who came before me, following their dreams to this river, building this nation, sharing its beauty, securing its future.\
 \
 (paragraph 17) It’s now my turn to help in keeping the river of dreams flowing, for all those dreamers yet to come.\
As used in paragraph 2, what does the phrase “fading into the background” mean?\
(A) disappearing from view\
 (B) losing its importance in people’s minds\
 (C) moving farther and farther from the city\
 (D) remaining important only to those who value nature\

If you grew up in Ireland you were told about the Famine. It was dinned [pounded] into you. In the history books there were pictures of huddled families dying of hunger in their hovels [simple dwelling], the same families being evicted—by English landlords—and with no place to go but a ditch.\
 \
 In the 1930s and 1940s old people in Limerick City still whispered of the horrors of that Famine less than 100 years before. They said it was the fault of the English. They said it was a fact that tons of corn [grain] were shipped out of the country to feed Her Majesty’s armies beyond. There was enough food to go around to feed Ireland ten times over. \
 \
 The old people said they would never forgive that of the English and they hoped we wouldn’t either. . . .\

 it. He’d started it. He’d just been offered two million dollars for it by the General Forge and\
 Foundry Company. He didn’t have any stockholders and he didn’t owe a dime. He was\
 fifty-one, a widower, and he had one heir—a son. The boy’s name was Franklin. The boy\
 (line 5) was named after Benjamin Franklin.\
 \
 One Friday afternoon father and son came out of Merle’s office and into the factory.\
 They went down a factory aisle to Rudy Linberg’s lathe. (lathe — a machine on which a piece of material, such as wood or metal, is spun and shaped against a fixed\
 cutting tool)\
 \
 “Rudy,” said Merle, “the boy here’s home from college for three days, and I thought\
 maybe you and him and your boy and me might go out to the farm and shoot some clay\
 (line 10) pigeons tomorrow.”\
 \
 Rudy turned his sky-blue eyes to Merle and young Franklin. He was Merle’s age, and\
 he had the deep and narrow dignity of a man who had learned his limitations early—who\
 had never tried to go beyond them. His limitations were those of his tools, his flute and his\
 shotgun. …\
 \
 (line 15) “Let’s go ask my boy what he’s got on tomorrow,” said Rudy. It was a formality. Karl\
 always did what his father wanted him to do—did it with profound love. …\
 \
 Karl was a carbon copy of his father. He was such a good mimic of Rudy that his joints\
 seemed to ache a little with age. He seemed sobered by fifty-one years of life, though he’d\
 lived only twenty. He seemed instinctively wary of safety hazards that had been eliminated\
 (line 20) from the factory by the time he’d learned to walk. Karl stood at attention without humility,\
 just as his father had done.\
 \
 “Want to go shooting tomorrow?” said Rudy.\
 “Shoot what?” said Karl.\
 “Crows. Clay pigeons,” said Rudy. “Maybe a woodchuck.”\
 \
 (line 25)“Don’t mind,” said Karl. He nodded briefly to Merle and Franklin. “Glad to.” …\
 Rudy nodded. He examined the work in Karl’s lathe and tapped his own temple. The\
 tapping was a signal that Franklin had seen many times on hunts. It meant that Karl was\
 doing fine.\
 \
 Rudy touched Karl’s elbow lightly. It was the signal for Karl to get back to work. Rudy\
 (line 30) and Karl each held up a crooked finger and saluted with it. Franklin knew what that meant\
 too. It meant, “Good-by, I love you.” …\
 \
 Merle was sitting at his desk, his head down, when Franklin came in. He held a steel\
 plate about six inches square in his left hand. In the middle of the plate was a hole two inches\
 square. In his right hand he held a steel cube that fitted the hole exactly. …\
 \
 (line 35) Franklin sat down gingerly on a hard chair by the wall. The office hadn’t changed much\
 in the years he’d known it. It was one more factory room, with naked pipes overhead—the\
 cold ones sweaty, the hot ones dry. Wires snaked from steel box to steel box. The green walls\
 and cream trim were as rough as elephant hide in some places, with alternating coats of\
 paint and grime, paint and grime.\
 \
 (line 40) There had never been time to scrape away the layers, and barely enough time,\
 overnight, to slap on new paint. And there had never been time in which to finish the rough\
 shelves that lined the room. …\
 \
 Merle slipped the cube through the square hole once more. “Know what these are?” he\
 said.\
 \
 (line 45) “Yes, sir,” said Franklin. “They’re what Rudy Linberg had to make when he was an\
 apprentice in Sweden.”\
 The cube could be slipped through the hole in twenty-four different ways, without\
 letting the tiniest ray of light pass through with it.\
 \
 “Unbelievable skill,” said Franklin respectfully. “There aren’t craftsmen like that\
 (line 50) coming along any more.” He didn’t really feel much respect. He was simply saying what he\
 knew his father wanted to hear. The cube and the hole struck him as criminal wastes of time\
 and great bores. “Unbelievable,” he said again.\
 \
 “It’s utterly unbelievable, when you realize that Rudy didn’t make them,” said Merle\
 gravely, “when you realize what generation the man who made them belongs to.”\
 \
 (line 55) “Oh?” said Franklin. “Who did make them?”\
 \
 “Rudy’s boy, Karl,” said Merle. “A member of your generation.” He ground out his cigar\
 sadly. “He gave them to me on my last birthday. They were on my desk, boy, waiting for me\
 when I came in—right beside the ones Rudy gave me thirty-one years before.” …\
 \
 “I could have cried, boy, when I saw those two plates and those two cubes side by side,”\
 (line 60) said Merle. “Can you understand that?” he asked beseechingly. “Can you understand why\
 I’d feel like crying?” …\
 \
 “The cube of Karl’s fitted through the hole of Rudy’s!” said Merle. “They were\
 interchangeable!”\
 \
 “Gosh!” said Franklin. “I’ll be darned. Really?”\
 \
 (line 65) And now he felt like crying, because he didn’t care, couldn’t care—and would have\
 given his right arm to care. The factory whanged and banged and screeched in monstrous\
 irrelevance—Franklin’s, all Franklin’s, if he just said the word.\
 \
 “What’ll you do with it—buy a theater in New York?” said Merle abruptly.\
 \
 “Do with what, sir?” said Franklin.\
 \
 (line 70) “The money I’ll get for the factory when I sell it—the money I’ll leave to you when I’m\
 dead,” said Merle. He hit the word “dead” hard. “What’s Waggoner Pump going to be\
 converted into? Waggoner Theaters? Waggoner School of Acting? The Waggoner Home for\
 Broken-Down Actors?”\
 \
 “I—I hadn’t thought about it,” said Franklin. The idea of converting Waggoner Pump\
 (line 75) into something equally complicated hadn’t occurred to him, and appalled him now. He was\
 being asked to match his father’s passion for the factory with an equal passion for something\
 else. And Franklin had no such passion—for the theater or anything else. …\
 \
 “Don’t sell on my account,” said Franklin wretchedly.\
 \
 “On whose account would I keep it?” said Merle.\
 \
 (line 80) “Do you have to sell it today?” said Franklin, horrified.\
 \
 “Strike while the iron’s hot, I always say,” said Merle. “Today’s the day you decided to\
 be an actor, and, as luck would have it, we have an excellent offer for what I did with my\
 life.”\
 \
 “Couldn’t we wait?”\
 \
 (line 85) “For what?” said Merle. He was having a good time now.\
 \
 “Father!” cried Franklin. “For the love of heaven, father, please!” He hung his head and\
 shook it. “I don’t know what I’m doing,” he said brokenly. “I don’t know for sure what I want\
 to do yet. I’m just playing with ideas, trying to find myself. Please, father, don’t sell what\
 you’ve done with your life, don’t just throw it away because I’m not sure I want to do that\
 (line 90) with my life too! Please!” Franklin looked up. “I’m not Karl Linberg,” he said. “I can’t help\
 it. I’m sorry, but I’m not Karl Linberg.” …\

 I’ve hunched so long above this puzzle\
 laid out on my gouged and ink-stained workbench,\
 I think, at last, it’s unsolvable,\
 that the only meaning it holds is told\
 (line 5) in the moments I feel on the verge\
 of understanding, and it turns me back.\
 \
 The pieces: so small, so many. How they\
 belong together is beyond me,\
 though early on my mind inclined\
 (line 10) toward an idyllic scene: a yellow field,\
 all jonquils (jonquils - a type of yellow daffodil), a sea, the wide horizon…\
 \
 The dog’s dish is empty. My wife and children\
 sleep. The house is hushed, except\
 for the stout hall clock that ticks its minutes.\
 (line 15) Here in my patch of lamplight, time\
 dawdles, waiting for me to catch up,\
 though a few small hairs on my wrist\
 have gone white, and evening’s blank encircles me.\
 \
 Who made this puzzle? If I sought him out\
 (line 20) would he hear my plea and reveal its logic?\
 But the hour is late, my vision strained.\
 How could I look for him now, though he were\
 waiting for me, and knew me by name?\

Reading Comprehension Passage C\
 \
 …Nowhere is light pollution more apparent, almost achingly so, than in satellite images\
 of the Earth from space. The continental United States seems to split in half: the eastern\
 side is brighter than the west, except for the klieg lights of Las Vegas. Highways innervate (innervate - energize)\
 America, connecting luminous dots of small towns and big cities. Across the Atlantic,\
 (line 5) Europe shimmers. Moscow is a radiant nine-pointed star. The Nile Delta glows like a\
 dandelion sprouting from mostly indigo Africa. Farther east, Hong Kong and Shanghai are\
 ablaze, and the demilitarised zone separates dark North Korea from South Korea more\
 cleanly than if the peninsula had been cleft in two. Developed society, it’s clear, is where the\
 light is.\
 \
 (line 10) Human-controlled light has pierced the night for thousands of years, long before\
 [Thomas] Edison. Campfires warmed our ancestors’ feet and cooked their meals; the\
 Harvard anthropologist Richard Wrangham argues in his book Catching Fire (2009) that\
 gathering around a flame to eat and to commune with others is, in fact, what made us\
 human. Not just fellowship but safety has long been the primary rationale for pushing back\
 (line 15) the night. ‘Evil spirits love not the smell of lamps,’ as Plato put it. Comforting, lambent (lambent — glowing or flickering with a soft radiance) \
 lamplight led us safely home by tattling on the people and potholes and animals that would\
 otherwise do us harm. By the early 17th century, residents of cities such as Paris and London\
 were admonished (admonished — warned) to keep lights burning in the windows of all houses that faced the streets,\
 as the historian A. Roger Ekirch notes in his book At Day’s Close: Night in Times Past\
 (line 20) (2005). Taxpayers funded oil lamps and candlelit lanterns for the avenues, while only\
 genteel households could afford fine beeswax or spermaceti candles; most people relied on\
 tallow, made from animal fat. …\
 \
 And even so — what price safety! A young but rapidly growing field of research suggests\
 that night-time light itself is far more dangerous than the dark. In a 2012 report, an\
 (line 25) American Medical Association committee called electric lighting a ‘man-made self-\
 experiment’ creating potentially harmful health effects. Humans, and everything else that\
 lives on this planet with us, evolved during billions of years along a reliable cycle of day and\
 night, with clear boundaries between them. Staunching the flood of artificial light can help\
 restore this divide. Our well-being, and that of our fellow creatures, might depend on us\
 (line 30) doing so — or at the very least trying. The loss of night-time darkness neglects our shared\
 past, but it might very well cut short our futures too. …\
 \
 A growing body of evidence shows that light pollution exacerbates (exacerbates — makes a situation worse),  and might directly\
 cause, cancer, obesity, and depression, the troublesome triumvirate (triumvirate — a group of three holding power) of industrialised\
 society. One of the first people to notice this correlation, at least as it applies to cancer, is\
 (line 35) Richard Stevens, a professor at the University of Connecticut, respected cancer\
 epidemiologist (epidemiologist — health professional who investigates patterns and causes of diseases), and mild insomniac. In the early 1980s, Stevens and other researchers\
 were beginning to realise there was little or no connection between diet and rising rates \
 breast cancer, contrary to what had been suspected. As Stevens puts it, it was like a light\
 bulb going on when he realised that, in fact, a light bulb going on might be a culprit. …\
 \
 (line 40) ‘Rather than falling, night, to the watchful eye, rises,’ writes Ekirch in At Day’s Close.\
 Shadows creep up lows and valleys first, then consume hillsides and houses and the tallest\
 buildings. Muted greys and deeper blues chase off the sun until finally the sky leaks no\
 colour. When we sleep according to a solar cycle, melatonin (melantonin - hormone that regulates sleep and wakefulness) production follows this\
 pattern, rising with the night. But artificial light tamps it down. This is frustratingly\
 (line 45) apparent for a special class of humans who experience sunsets every 90 minutes: astronauts.\
 \
 One of the most frequent complaints of orbital crew members is insomnia; they pop\
 sleeping pills on a regular basis, and still get only about six hours of shuteye, though they’re\
 allotted eight. Steven W. Lockley, a Harvard neuroscientist, recommends altering the light\
 to improve matters. In 2012, he advised NASA [National Aeronautics and Space\
 (line 50) Administration] engineers to change the light bulbs on the International Space Station to a\
 type of LED that can display blue-shifted light during the ‘day’, when the crew is working,\
 and red-shifted light when they need to rest. Why the difference? That crucial ganglion (ganglion — mass of nerve tissues in the brain),\
 the circadian (circadian — 24-hour biological cycle) photoreceptor, is particularly sensitive to light toward the bluish end of the\
 red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo and violet visible-light spectrum. …\
 \
 (line 55) Insomnia is hardly the worst side effect of light pollution. Shift workers, who rise with\
 the night and work awash in blue light, experience not only disrupted circadian rhythms and\
 sleep deprivation, but an increased risk of breast and prostate cancer. These cancers, which\
 require hormones to grow, are suppressed in the presence of melatonin, Stevens has shown.\
 In 2010, Stevens published a review of breast cancer sensitivity in 164 countries, and found\
 (line 60) a 30 to 50 per cent increased risk of cancer in nations with the worst light pollution, but no\
 increased prevalence of non-hormonally dependent cancers in the same populations.\
 \
 ‘Our use of electric light in the modern world is disrupting our circadian sleep and our\
 biology. There is no question about that. Does that have physiological consequences? There\
 is more and more evidence that it does,’ Stevens told me. ‘The epidemiological studies are\
 (line 65) the crudest, but the most important.’ …\
 \
 When we, in the industrialised world, do manage to turn off the lights, there are\
 measurable, beneficial effects on our circadian rhythms. In a widely reported paper last\
 summer, Kenneth Wright at the University of Colorado at Boulder took eight students\
 camping in the Rocky Mountains for two weeks. They weren’t allowed to use any artificial\
 (line 70) light after the sun went down — only the sanguine (sanguine — red) glow of campfire. After a week,\
 melatonin started to rise at sunset, peak in the middle of the night, and taper just at sunrise,\
 which Wright called a ‘remarkable’ result. ‘Internal biological time under natural light-dark\
 conditions tightly synchronises to environmental time, and in this regard, humans are\
 comparable to other animals,’ he wrote. …\
 \
 (line 75) For those of us addicted to our glowing phones and tablets, an app called F.lux can help.\
 It ‘warms’ your device’s display screen so that it shifts red in the evening, more closely\
 matching incandescent bulbs and the hue of the setting sun. Just a brief glimpse at your\
 mobile phone at bedtime is enough to expose your retinas to artificial light, so fighting such\
 a comprehensive intrusion might be an exercise in futility. But even if we can’t completely\
 (line 80) quench our thirst for light, we can all make one small gesture, which could prompt us to\
 unplug a little more. …\

Excerpt from Gregor and the Sheep\
 by Toby Rosenstrauch\
 \
 (paragraph 1) In a valley in the highlands of Scotland, there once lived a young tenant farmer, Gregor, and his widowed mother. Although they worked hard, they could never accumulate enough money to buy the flock of sheep they longed to have, for their small parcel of land produced only modest amounts of oats and barley. To make matters worse, MacTavish, the owner of this and many other crofts, always found reasons not to pay the farmers all they had earned. . . .\
 \
 crofts = small farms\
 \
 (paragraph 2) When he opened the door each morning and looked out, he saw MacTavish’s house on top of a mountain, a magnificent stone mansion surrounded by red, pink, and violet rhododendrons. Gregor often climbed the slope and stood outside the iron gates, wondering what fine furnishings and delicious foods lay within. Neighbors claimed that MacTavish owned many houses and even kept a chest of gems under his bed. As Gregor, his mother, and their neighbors grew gaunt and pale with hard work and not enough food, they railed against MacTavish, who had swindled all of them at one time or another.\
 \
 swindled = cheated or tricked\
 \
 (paragraph 3) One day, as Gregor listened to the bagpipe music that drifted from the open windows of MacTavish’s mansion, he had an idea. That night, when his mother was asleep, he emptied the jug that held their money and counted it. After putting back a few coins for food, he put the rest in his pocket. The next morning, he hurried to the market, where he went from farmer to farmer, asking the prices of sheep for sale. Gregor found many handsome animals, but they were all too expensive. When he reached a stall with scrawny and sickly sheep, the owner beckoned to him. . . .\
 \
 (paragraph 4) Gregor shook his head and began to walk away. The man grabbed his sleeve and whispered in his ear, “This one will make her owner rich!” Gregor examined the old sheep with spindly legs and dirty, unkempt wool—the worst of the lot. “If she will make me rich,” said Gregor, “how is it that she has not done so for you?”\
 \
 (paragraph 5) The man paused, thinking. “I have not had her long enough!”\
 \
 (paragraph 6) “Nonsense,” said Gregor, but he gave the man his money and led the pitiful animal home.\
 \
 (paragraph 7) When his mother saw what he had bought with their money, she burst into tears. “My foolish son, what have you done? Now we will starve, and no one will help us!”\
 \
 (paragraph 8) “Do as I say, Mother, and we will be rich. I promise.”\
 \
 (paragraph 9) She wanted to believe him. Wiping her eyes with her ragged sleeve, she asked what he wanted her to do.\
 \
 (paragraph 10) “Go to market and tell everyone that your son has a sheep that will make whoever owns her rich,” said Gregor. . . .\
 \
 (paragraph 11) One morning, a carriage arrived. Two servants opened the door and a stout, welldressed gentleman emerged. His Tartan kilt was made of the finest wool, his ascot was pure silk, and his shoes had silver buckles. On his fat fingers were eight gold rings, and his pomaded hair glistened in the sun. It was MacTavish!\
 \
 Tartan kilt = traditional clothing worn by Scottish Highlanders\
 \
 ascot = a type of necktie\
 \
 (paragraph 12) Gregor bowed as if to royalty. MacTavish looked at him sternly. “I have come to rid you of the unfortunate sheep that everyone is talking about,” said MacTavish, opening his sporran. “I can pay your price and I will have her, even though she has done nothing for you, I see.” MacTavish sneered at Gregor.\
 \
 sporran = a small bag worn at the waist for holding personal items\
 \
 (paragraph 13) Gregor hugged Dear One. “I will not sell her to you!”\
 \
 (paragraph 14) ”At that, MacTavish, whose servants were helping him into his carriage, turned and marched back. “I will pay anything,” he said. “Name the price.”\
 \
 (paragraph 15) Gregor was ready. “That,” he said, pointing up to the mansion above them. “I will have the dwelling and everything in it—furniture, utensils, even the chest of gems under your bed.”\
 \
 (paragraph 16) “Done,” said MacTavish.\
 \
 (paragraph 17) The next day, Gregor and his mother moved into the mansion that had once belonged to MacTavish, and MacTavish brought Dear One to the market so that all might see he could indeed own anything he wanted. Then MacTavish and the sheep rode away in his carriage to another of his houses in a valley beyond the mountains.\
 \
 (paragraph 18) After months had passed and the sheep had done nothing to increase MacTavish’s riches, he realized he had been swindled. Furious beyond speech, he returned to the mansion, but Gregor would not open the gates.\
 \
 (paragraph 19) “I have been cheated!” shouted MacTavish.\
 \
 (paragraph 20) “You have not been cheated,” said Gregor. “I was the owner of the sheep, and she has made me rich, hasn’t she?”\
 \
 (paragraph 21) “Yes, but . . . ,” sputtered MacTavish.\
 \
 (paragraph 22) “Then you got what you paid for.” Gregor turned and walked away.\
 \
 (paragraph 23) Soon afterward, Gregor sold the chest of gems and bought the huge flock of sheep he and his mother had always wanted. He shared the rest of his fortune with the other poor families of the valley who had been cheated by MacTavish.\
Which of Gregor’s actions shows how he is different from MacTavish?\
(A) Gregor cheats another person.\
 (B) Gregor buys a sickly sheep.\
 (C) Gregor shares his wealth.\
 (D) Gregor moves to a big house.\

 Excerpt from Waste Not, Want Not\
 by Teresa Bateman\
 \
 (paragraph 1) My mother believed in using things up. We always squeezed the toothpaste tube until it was as sharp as a razor, and we cleaned our plates, even when it was liver-andonions\
 night. . . .\
 \
 (paragraph 2) Mom’s frugality was legendary. She could make one chicken come back in a dozen meals as variously disguised leftovers. Her favorite saying was “waste not, want not.” Josh and I weren’t sure what that meant, but it probably explained why Mom was into recycling long before it became popular. It also explained why the “Affair of the Hat,” as it later became known, was so strange.\
 \
 (paragraph 3) The Hat deserved capital letters. It was about three feet across, made of green straw and covered with big plastic daisies, two red peonies, and an orange bow. I might have said it was “dog ugly,” except that wouldn’t sit well with our dog, Mutt.\
 \
 (paragraph 4) Great-aunt Marjorie had given The Hat to Mother on one of her visits to our farm. It was supposed to keep the sun off Mother’s delicate complexion while enhancing her rural beauty (whatever that meant). . . .\
 \
 (paragraph 5) When Aunt Marjorie returned to the city, Josh and I held our breath to see what would happen to The Hat. We could see that Mom’s thrifty nature and fashion sense were in pitched battle. She couldn’t justify throwing The Hat away—it was nearly new and had a lot of use left in it—but neither could she stomach wearing it. She tried pulling off the daisies and peonies, but they were stuck on tight, as were the perky orange ribbons that held The Hat in place. She’d have to find some other solution.\
 \
 (paragraph 6) One day Josh and I came down to breakfast and noticed that The Hat was missing from the hook by the door. We looked at each other, then scouted the house. It wasn’t hard to spot. Mother had installed it in the parlor as a lampshade.\
 \
 (paragraph 7) Our parakeet, Pete, chirped inquiringly from his cage as Josh and I decided to see how The Hat looked in full lampshade glory. We pulled the chain.\
 \
 (paragraph 8 ) Pete tweeted once, then dropped like a stone from his perch. We ran to his cage, and Josh suggested mouth-to-beak resuscitation. Then we glanced over at the lamp. The light shining through the peonies made them look like two big red eyes glaring at you. No wonder Pete had fainted. We plucked The Hat from the lamp and went to tell Mom. Reluctantly she hung it back up on the hook by the door. . . .\
 \
 (paragraph 9) The next morning she headed out the door, The Hat filled to the brim with turkey feed. Josh and I watched as Mother approached the turkeys scavenging in the barnyard. The minute those turkeys sighted The Hat, they ran gobbling toward the barn door and dived in a panic into the haystack. Mom dumped the turkey feed in the barnyard and\
 walked back to the house, her shoulders drooping. . . .\
 \
 (paragraph 10) She threw The Hat to the floor, raised her foot, and screamed, “THIS HAT IS FOR THE BIRDS!” Josh and I stepped back, waiting for her foot to come crashing down.\
 \
 (paragraph 11) “It is not for the birds,” Josh blurted. \"They hate it!”\
 \
 (paragraph 12) It was as though time stood still. Then we heard a strange sound. Mother was laughing!\
 \
 (paragraph 13) We shook our heads. She’d finally gone over the edge—there she stood, one foot in the air, laughing like a hysterical flamingo.\
 \
 (paragraph 14) Then she put her foot down . . . on the floor. She picked up The Hat and headed upstairs where we heard boxes being shuffled around in the attic. . .\
 \
 (paragraph 15) When she came down, she was dragging a body. It was wearing Grandpa’s old overalls, Uncle Paul’s flannel shirt, and the shoes Josh had outgrown last year. Its head was a flour sack, stuffed full of straw from an old tick, and on that head perched The Hat.\
 \
 tick = mattress\
 \
 (paragraph 16) Mom hauled the stuffed body outside and set it up on a post in the middle of the cornfield. And that’s where it stayed.\
 \
 (paragraph 17) Our corn crop that year was particularly good. For some reason the birds steered clear of our fields and raided the neighbors’ instead. Maybe it had something to do with our scarecrow, I don’t know. All I do know is that from then on, we rarely saw crows on our property except during the month of June.\
 \
 (paragraph 16) That’s when Great-aunt Marjorie comes to visit.\
How are the narrator and Josh alike?\
(A) They both make comments that cause their mother to have new ideas.\
 (B) They both are interested in watching their mother solve her problem.\
 (C) They both contribute their old items to build the scarecrow for the field.\
 (D) They both joke about how their dog is more attractive than the hat.\

Excerpt from Humans With Amazing Senses\
 \
 When bats go out to hunt, they send out sonar signals at such high frequencies and in\
 such rapid bursts that they can hear the signals bounce off mosquitoes in midair. They\
 then zero in on the insects like laser-guided missiles. Dolphins use the same technique to\
 find their dinners. It’s called echolocation, a technique that uses sound to identify objects\
 (line 5) by the echoes they produce.\
 Fourteen-year-old Ben Underwood of Sacramento, Calif., is one of the few people\
 known to use echolocation as a primary means of navigating the world on land. There’s\
 not even a hint of light reaching his brain. His eyes are artificial, but his brain has adapted\
 to allow him to appraise his environment. He makes a “clicking” sound to communicate\
 (line 10) with objects and people around him.\
 Scientists have discovered that in the brains of the blind, the visual cortex has not\
 become useless, as they once believed. When blind people use another sense—touch or\
 hearing, for example—to substitute for sight, the brain’s visual cortex becomes active, even\
 though no images reach it from the optic nerve. Echolocation creates its own images.\
 (line 15) “I can hear that wall behind you over there. I can hear right there—the radio, and the\
 fan,” Ben says.\
 Ben says every object in his life talks to him in ways that no one else can hear\
 or understand.\
 Forty-year-old Daniel Kish of Long Beach, Calif., also uses echolocation, and has\
 (line 20) become an expert on it, founding the World Access for the Blind, an organization that\
 teaches others how to echolocate. Kish leads other blind people on mountain biking tours\
 and hikes in the wilderness, visualizing and describing the picturesque sights around him\
 through echolocating.\
 Clicking to Do Anything\
 If you listen closely to Ben or Kish, you can hear how they find their way. Ben says he\
 (line 25) can distinguish where the curbs are as he cruises his neighborhood streets.\
 He can find the pole and the backboard on a basketball goal, and tell which is which\
 by the distinctive echo each makes. Even though he can’t see the goal he’s aiming for, he\
 can sink a basket. Ben doesn’t remember how or when he began clicking, but he’s\
 developed his abilities to such an extent that aside from echolocation, he can rapidly\
 (line 30) discriminate the sounds in video games.\
 Ben lost his sight when he was 2. He was diagnosed with cancer in both eyes, and\
 when chemotherapy failed, his mother, Aquanetta Gordon, was left with one option: For\
 her son to live, both his eyes had to be surgically removed.\
 Gordon remembers her son after the operation.\
 (line 35) “He woke up and he said, ‘Mom, I can’t see anymore, I can’t see anymore.’ And I took\
 his hands and I put them on my face and I said, ‘Baby, yes, you can see.’ I said, ‘You can\
 see with your hands.’ And then I put my hand on his nose and I said, ‘You smell me? You\
 can see with your nose and your ears. . . . You can’t use your eyes anymore, but you have\
 your hands and your nose and your ears.’ ”\
 (line 40) In a house already filled with three other children, Ben’s mother decided not to treat\
 his blindness as a handicap. In school, Ben recognizes his classmates by their voices. With\
 the help of Braille books and a talking laptop computer, Ben attends the same classes as\
 sighted students.\
 Rich Mental Images, Without Visual Elements\
 Like Ben, Kish also lost his eyesight to cancer at age 1. He was raised to believe he\
 (line 45) could do pretty much anything, and he discovered clicking by accident as a child.\
 “I have mental images that are very rich, very complex. They simply do not possess\
 the visual element,” Kish says.\
 In retrieving those pictures, Kish varies the pace and volume of his clicks as he\
 walks along; and what he can tell you about an object’s qualities is sometimes\
 (line 50) astonishingly thorough.\
 If bats can distinguish prey as small as mosquitoes with echolocation, and some\
 dolphins can detect small targets a hundred yards away, what are the ultimate capabilities\
 of human beings like Ben and Kish?\
 Peter Scheifele, who studies hearing and sound production in animals and people at\
 (line 55) the University of Connecticut, analyzed samples of the clicks that Ben and Kish make.\
 “Ben clicks, looks to me like once every half second, whereas a dolphin is actually\
 making 900 clicks per second. And the bat is even faster than that,” Scheifele says.\
 The bottom line: Human beings send out sounds at much slower rates and lower\
 frequencies, so the objects people can picture with echolocation must be much larger than\
 (line 60) the ones bats and dolphins can find.\
Echolocation used by humans is distinct from echolocation used by animals because animals can\
(A) create louder clicking noises\
 (B) distinguish among more sounds\
 (C) see objects that are farther away\
 (D) locate objects that are smaller in size\

Bacteria reproduce asexually by a process known as binary fission. In binary fission, the bacterium’s single chromosome is copied and the cell splits in half, with each new cell receiving a copy of the chromosome. The biggest advantage that binary fission often has over sexual reproduction is that\
(1) there is more genetic variety in the resulting cells\
 (2) the genetic material comes from two parents\
 (3) the offspring inherit only favorable genes\
 (4) a large number of identical offspring are produced\

Reading Comprehension Passage C\
 \
 Get That Song Outta My Head!\
 \
    The nightmare began when my husband walked into our kitchen and said, “I’ve had this\
 song stuck in my head all day …”\
    No! I thought. Don’t say it!\
    “Remember that song from the original Karate Kid movie?” he continued.\
 (line 5)   For the love of God, no!\
    “You know how it goes. ‘You’re the best around … na na na na na, na na na na. You’re\
 the best around …”\
    It was too late. Now I had an earworm — a song, melody or jingle that gets stuck in your\
 head.\
 (line 10)   The worst part? I only knew that same line. I walked around humming it for days. I tried\
 to shake it by singing along with tunes playing on my car radio while I was out running\
 errands. For a brief time, Van Halen’s “Runnin’ With the Devil” replaced it.\
    But in no time at all, that one line from “You’re the Best,” sung by Joe Esposito on the\
 The Karate Kid soundtrack, was back.\
 (line 15)   Perhaps if I heard more of the song in my head, it wouldn’t be as annoying. But just this\
 one line? Over and over and over again? It was pure torture. I needed to do something\
 drastic. I busted out that 1980s hit, “The Safety Dance” by Men Without Hats. After singing\
 it a few times, the earworm was gone.\
    I knew I’d get another one, though. About 90 percent of people experience earworms\
 (line 20) at least once a week, according to the Earworm Project run by the Music, Mind and Brain\
 group at Goldsmiths, University of London.\
    “Music lovers, specifically people who ascribe (ascribe - credit) more importance to music or people\
 who spend more time listening to music, have more frequent and longer earworm\
 episodes,” says Kelly Jakubowski, a researcher with the Earworm Project. …\
 (line 25)   To find out what causes earworms and how to get rid of them, I contacted the man\
 known as “Dr. Earworm,” James Kellaris, a marketing professor at the University of\
 Cincinnati. Certainly with a nickname like that, he would know something.\
    Kellaris began studying earworms in 1999. A former professional musician prone to\
 getting earworms himself, he eventually became a marketing professor “interested in how\
 (line 30) marketers use music to achieve various commercial goals,” he says. “It was a perfect storm\
 to create an earworms researcher.”\
    He explained to me that when we get an earworm, the tune seems to repeat itself\
 involuntarily, which is why experts consider earworms involuntary musical imagery (INMI).\
 This was exactly what “You’re the Best” had done to me.\
 (line 35)   So what, precisely, was happening in my brain when I couldn’t shake that tune?\
 Jakubowski contributed to a May 2015 study led by Nicolas Farrugia, a postdoctoral\
 researcher with the Earworm Project, that demonstrated auditory and inhibitory-related\
 areas play a role in earworms as well.\
    The researchers examined 44 healthy subjects, all between 25 and 70 years old and all\
 (line 40) participants of a past neuroimaging study run by the Cambridge Medical Research\
 Council’s Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit. These subjects took an online survey that\
 measured both the extent of their musical training and how strongly INMIs impacted them.\
 For example, the survey wanted to know how strong of a negative impact INMIs had on\
 them or if INMIs were actually helpful while they went about their everyday activities.\
 (line 45)   When they examined these participants’ brain images, one pattern in particular stuck\
 out: People who got earworms more often had a thinner right frontal cortex, which is\
 involved in inhibition, (inhibition -restraining behavior) and a thinner temporal cortex, which processes sensory stimuli like\
 sound. In other words, these people’s brains just weren’t as good at suppressing the random\
 song that might pop into their heads.\
 (line 50)   Why we get earworms, unfortunately, remains a scientific mystery. “We know that songs\
 that are ‘catchy’ — short, simple, repetitive and contain some incongruity — are most likely\
 to get stuck,” Kellaris says. Most people are more likely to get a song like “Don’t Worry, Be\
 Happy” stuck in their heads than, say, a Mahler symphony. And some things exacerbate\
 them: frequency and duration of exposure to music, worry, stress, fatigue and idleness.\
 (line 55)   Considering that my husband kept singing the snippet (snippet - short piece) while I was tired and stressed,\
 I can see why it got stuck. But my earworms have been relatively innocuous. (innocuous - harmless) Even though\
 they’re annoying, I can eventually get rid of them. Some people can’t, though.\
    Part of Kellaris’ earliest research involved mailing a questionnaire to about 1,000\
 respondents at four U.S. universities. He asked them if they’d ever had an earworm, for how\
 (line 60) long, how often it happened, how it made them feel, etc.\
    One respondent claimed to have had a song stuck in his head since 1978. This is known\
 as intrusive musical imagery (IMI), a musical obsession that’s chronic and highly distracting\
 to a person’s everyday life and work. According to Dean McKay, a psychology professor at\
 Fordham University, my short-lived earworm was nothing compared to an IMI.\
 (line 65)   But now I was concerned. Could my future earworms turn into these IMIs? Is there a\
 way to prevent this from happening?\
    McKay co-authored a June 2014 study titled “Musical obsessions: A comprehensive\
 review of neglected clinical phenomena.” For this study, McKay and other international\
 colleagues, all of whom treat obsessive-compulsive disorder, created the first\
 (line 70) comprehensive review of musical obsessions. They compiled a database of 96 case study\
 descriptions of people with severe musical obsessions — the largest compilation (compilation - collection) assembled\
 on this topic. They determined the characteristics of musical obsessions such as IMIs and\
 compared them with earworms, musical hallucinations and visual obsessional imagery.\
    The group’s research showed that IMIs can be treated by using a method known as\
 (line 75) distraction — coming up with a competing melody to think about that would get rid of the\
 IMI. That’s exactly what I had done, albeit unknowingly, when I used “The Safety Dance”\
 to stop my earworm.\
    McKay says my earworm was pesky because I knew only that one part of the song. He\
 suggests if I have just a portion of a song looping in my brain in the future, I can try another\
 (line 80) method called exposure — simply listening to the entire song. “It’s like a completion task,”\
 he says. “Once you know the whole song, then there’s no need for it to be stuck in your\
 head.”\
    Another form of distraction is to sing the song out loud, but change some of the words\
 or slightly throw off the melody. One of McKay’s patients had an IMI based on a Taylor\
 (line 85) Swift song. “We made up some other words for it,” he explains. “We messed up the melody\
 a bit, but not so much that it wasn’t recognizable as still being that song, and then it faded.”\
 McKay stresses that this is the only case he’s tried this in, so it’s not a forgone conclusion\
 this kind of distraction would work in other instances.\
    What I wanted to know was if the earworm I get today could become the IMI of\
 (line 90) tomorrow.\
    “Highly improbable,” he says.\
    “You’re the best,” I reply.\
    Oh no.\

In West Africa, the Harmattan is a dry, dust-filled wind.\
 Excerpt from A Scrap and a Robe\
 by Myrina D. McCullough\
 \
 (paragraph 1) The West African Harmattan whipped up a billow of dust. Suddenly Sali spied a scrap of glorious orange damask cloth turning in the hot wind like a flame. She followed as it danced down a street she didn’t know very well. She skipped over holes and skirted people on chairs.\
 damask = woven cloth\
 skirted = went around\
 (paragraph 2) All at once the wind died down, and the scrap settled gently on the scratchy, sandy road.\
 (paragraph 3) Sali picked up the cloth and gazed at it with admiring eyes. She turned it this way and that in the sun and imagined herself in a flowing dlokibani made of such cloth. This was a treasure, and she would take it home for her little wooden doll. It would surely make a lovely headpiece for that lucky one.\
 dlokibani or dloki = a long dress\
 (paragraph 4) Sali wandered back the way she had come, slowly now. At the corner of the street, she passed the table vendor, who was selling his dusty packets of tea and two-pill packs of aspirin. She passed Ami’s mother, roasting peanuts and selling them by the handful. She turned onto the larger street and passed a plastic-goods store that displayed rows and rows of brightly colored plastic plates, bowls, and teapots. She glanced into the next shop and then stopped short. It was a fabric shop! There on the high counter was an entire bolt of the same wondrous cloth she held in her hand!\
 (paragraph 5) The next day Sali went back to the cloth shop. She stood near the door and watched the storekeeper. He measured and cut, as one person after another bought pieces of cloth. Her prized orange damask was back on a high shelf to the rear of the store.\
 (paragraph 6) After a while the shopkeeper looked at Sali. “Why do you stand so long at the door?” he asked.\
 (paragraph 7) Sali took a deep breath and said, “I would like to help you in the store till I could earn enough of that orange cloth to make a dlokibani for myself.”\
 (paragraph 8) The orange fabric glowed in a shaft of light from the uncovered bulb at the back of the store.\
 (paragraph 9) “That is very special and expensive cloth, little one,” the shopkeeper told her.\
 (paragraph 10) So she swept the courtyard and threw away scraps. She pushed big rolls of cloth back and forth. She ran to buy cough drops and peanuts and kola nuts for the shopkeeper. For days and days she worked.\
 (paragraph 11) Finally, one day the store owner lifted down the lustrous roll of orange damask and measured out several yards. “You’ve worked well for this cloth, Sali,” he said. “I thank you.”\
 (paragraph 12) Sali rushed straight home with her treasure. Carefully she placed the cloth in her trunk.\
 (paragraph 13) But how was she to get the dloki made? Sali did not know how to sew. Her mother always had their clothes made by a tailor who sat in a tiny shop several blocks from their house.\
 (paragraph 14) Sali went and stood under a tree near the tailor’s shop. She watched the people come and go. The tailor would whip out his measuring tape and see how tall the people were, how fat they were, how long their arms, how short their necks. He measured every part of them.\
 (paragraph 15) After almost a whole day the tailor noticed Sali.\
 (paragraph 16) “What are you doing there, little girl?” he asked.\
 (paragraph 17) “I have some beautiful cloth,” she said, “and I want it sewn into a dlokibani. Could I work for you to pay for sewing it into a robe for me?”\
 (paragraph 18) The tailor agreed. Once again Sali worked for days and days. She swept and fanned the tea coals and held scissors and brought thread. At last, the tailor said, “Bring me the cloth, Sali.”\
 (paragraph 19) Sali rushed home and brought back the satiny, shining cloth. She also brought her doll, its small head still neatly wrapped in the swatch of orange. The tailor took his tape and measured Sali, shoulder to ankle, shoulder to elbow, left shoulder to right shoulder. Then he started cutting the billows of orange fabric.\
 (paragraph 20) The next day was an important holiday called Tabaski. Drums were beating in many neighborhoods. Relatives and friends came to visit Sali’s family. Sali slipped quietly away. Soon her mother missed her. “Now where has Sali gone?” she exclaimed.\
 (paragraph 21) Just then, Sali walked in, proudly wearing a beautiful orange dloki with a matching headdress. In her arms she carried her doll, dressed exactly as she was!\
In paragraph 1, what does the phrase “like a flame” help the reader to understand about\
 the cloth?\
(A) its size and how much it weighs\
 (B) its color and how it moves\
 (C) its temperature and its direction\
 (D) its pattern and its use\

The genius of apartheid was convincing people who were the overwhelming majority to turn on each other. Apart hate, is what it was. You separate people into groups and make them hate one another so you can run them all.\
 \
 At the time, black South Africans outnumbered white South Africans nearly five to one, yet we were divided into different tribes with different languages: Zulu, Xhosa, Tswana, Sotho, Venda, Ndebele, Tsonga, Pedi, and more. Long before apartheid existed these tribal factions clashed and warred with one another. Then white rule used that animosity [hatred] to divide and conquer. All nonwhites were systematically classified into various groups and subgroups. Then these groups were given differing levels of rights and privileges in order to keep them at odds. . . .\

 — Trevor Noah, Born a Crime: Stories from a South African Childhood, Spiegel & Grau, 2016\
According to this author, how did the minority white population maintain control over the majority black population in South Africa?\
(1) through military conscription of black South Africans\
 (2) through divide and conquer techniques that kept tribes at odds\
 (3) by enforcing the use of tribal languages so that tribes could not communicate\
 (4) by allowing democracy within localized areas in the black South African community\

 Excerpt from Gregor and the Sheep\
 by Toby Rosenstrauch\
 \
 (paragraph 1) In a valley in the highlands of Scotland, there once lived a young tenant farmer, Gregor, and his widowed mother. Although they worked hard, they could never accumulate enough money to buy the flock of sheep they longed to have, for their small parcel of land produced only modest amounts of oats and barley. To make matters\
 worse, MacTavish, the owner of this and many other crofts, always found reasons not to pay the farmers all they had earned. . . .\
 \
 crofts = small farms\
 \
 (paragraph 2) When he opened the door each morning and looked out, he saw MacTavish’s house on top of a mountain, a magnificent stone mansion surrounded by red, pink, and violet rhododendrons. Gregor often climbed the slope and stood outside the iron gates, wondering what fine furnishings and delicious foods lay within. Neighbors claimed\
 that MacTavish owned many houses and even kept a chest of gems under his bed. As Gregor, his mother, and their neighbors grew gaunt and pale with hard work and not enough food, they railed against MacTavish, who had swindled all of them at one time or another.\
 \
 swindled = cheated or tricked\
 \
 (paragraph 3) One day, as Gregor listened to the bagpipe music that drifted from the open windows of MacTavish’s mansion, he had an idea. That night, when his mother was asleep, he emptied the jug that held their money and counted it. After putting back a few coins for food, he put the rest in his pocket. The next morning, he hurried to the market, where he went from farmer to farmer, asking the prices of sheep for sale.\
 Gregor found many handsome animals, but they were all too expensive. When he reached a stall with scrawny and sickly sheep, the owner beckoned to him. . . .\
 \
 (paragraph 4) Gregor shook his head and began to walk away. The man grabbed his sleeve and whispered in his ear, “This one will make her owner rich!” Gregor examined the old sheep with spindly legs and dirty, unkempt wool—the worst of the lot. “If she will make me rich,” said Gregor, “how is it that she has not done so for you?”\
 \
 (paragraph 5) The man paused, thinking. “I have not had her long enough!”\
 \
 (paragraph 6) “Nonsense,” said Gregor, but he gave the man his money and led the pitiful animal home.\
 \
 (paragraph 7) When his mother saw what he had bought with their money, she burst into tears. “My foolish son, what have you done? Now we will starve, and no one will help us!”\
 \
 (paragraph 8) “Do as I say, Mother, and we will be rich. I promise.”\
 \
 (paragraph 9) She wanted to believe him. Wiping her eyes with her ragged sleeve, she asked what he wanted her to do.\
 \
 (paragraph 10) “Go to market and tell everyone that your son has a sheep that will make whoever owns her rich,” said Gregor. . . .\
 \
 (paragraph 11) One morning, a carriage arrived. Two servants opened the door and a stout, welldressed gentleman emerged. His Tartan kilt was made of the finest wool, his ascot was pure silk, and his shoes had silver buckles. On his fat fingers were eight gold rings, and his pomaded hair glistened in the sun. It was MacTavish!\
 \
 Tartan kilt = traditional clothing worn by Scottish Highlanders\
 \
 ascot = a type of necktie\
 \
 (paragraph 12) Gregor bowed as if to royalty. MacTavish looked at him sternly. “I have come to rid you of the unfortunate sheep that everyone is talking about,” said MacTavish, opening his sporran. “I can pay your price and I will have her, even though she has done nothing for you, I see.” MacTavish sneered at Gregor.\
 \
 sporran = a small bag worn at the waist for holding personal items\
 \
 (paragraph 13) Gregor hugged Dear One. “I will not sell her to you!”\
 \
 (paragraph 14) ”At that, MacTavish, whose servants were helping him into his carriage, turned and marched back. “I will pay anything,” he said. “Name the price.”\
 \
 (paragraph 15) Gregor was ready. “That,” he said, pointing up to the mansion above them. “I will have the dwelling and everything in it—furniture, utensils, even the chest of gems under your bed.”\
 \
 (paragraph 16) “Done,” said MacTavish.\
 \
 (paragraph 17) The next day, Gregor and his mother moved into the mansion that had once belonged to MacTavish, and MacTavish brought Dear One to the market so that all might see he could indeed own anything he wanted. Then MacTavish and the sheep rode away in his carriage to another of his houses in a valley beyond the mountains.\
 \
 (paragraph 18) After months had passed and the sheep had done nothing to increase MacTavish’s riches, he realized he had been swindled. Furious beyond speech, he returned to the mansion, but Gregor would not open the gates.\
 \
 (paragraph 19) “I have been cheated!” shouted MacTavish.\
 \
 (paragraph 20) “You have not been cheated,” said Gregor. “I was the owner of the sheep, and she has made me rich, hasn’t she?”\
 \
 (paragraph 21) “Yes, but . . . ,” sputtered MacTavish.\
 \
 (paragraph 22) “Then you got what you paid for.” Gregor turned and walked away.\
 \
 (paragraph 21) Soon afterward, Gregor sold the chest of gems and bought the huge flock of sheep he and his mother had always wanted. He shared the rest of his fortune with the other poor families of the valley who had been cheated by MacTavish.\
What does the phrase “marched back” in paragraph 14 suggest about MacTavish?\
(A) He is confused.\
 (B) He is worried.\
 (C) He is determined.\
 (D) He is excited.\

Reading Comprehension Passage C\
 Many Animals Can Count, Some Better Than You\
 \
 Every night during breeding season, the male túngara frog of Central America will stake\
 out a performance patch in the local pond and spend unbroken hours broadcasting\
 his splendor to the world.\
 The mud-brown frog is barely the size of a shelled pecan, but his call is large and\
 (line 5) dynamic, a long downward sweep that sounds remarkably like a phaser weapon on\
 \"Star Trek,\" followed by a brief, twangy, harmonically dense chuck.(chuck - a clucking sound)\
 Unless, that is, a competing male starts calling nearby, in which case the first frog is\
 likely to add two chucks to the tail of his sweep. And should his rival respond likewise,\
 Male A will tack on three chucks.\
 (line 10) Back and forth they go, call and raise, until the frogs hit their respiratory limit at six\
 to seven rapid-fire chucks.\
 The acoustic one-upfrogship is energetically draining and risks attracting predators like\
 bats. Yet the male frogs have no choice but to keep count of the competition, for the simple\
 reason that female túngaras are doing the same: listening, counting and ultimately mating\
 (line 15) with the male of maximum chucks.\
 Behind the frog’s surprisingly sophisticated number sense, scientists have found, are\
 specialized cells in the amphibian midbrain that tally up sound signals and the intervals\
 between them.\
 \"The neurons are counting the number of appropriate pulses, and they’re highly\
 (line 20) selective,\" said Gary Rose, a biologist at the University of Utah. If the timing between\
 pulses is off by just a fraction of a second, the neurons don’t fire and the counting process\
 breaks down. …\
 Scientists have found that animals across the evolutionary spectrum have a keen sense\
 of quantity, able to distinguish not just bigger from smaller or more from less, but two from\
 (line 25) four, four from ten, forty from sixty.\
 Orb-weaving spiders, for example, keep a tally of how many silk-wrapped prey items are\
 stashed in the \"larder\" segment of their web. When scientists experimentally remove the\
 cache, the spiders will spend time searching for the stolen goods in proportion to how many\
 separate items had been taken, rather than how big the total prey mass might have been.\
 (line 30) Small fish benefit from living in schools, and the more numerous the group, the\
 statistically better a fish’s odds of escaping predation. As a result, many shoaling (shoaling - shallow water) fish are\
 excellent appraisers of relative head counts.\
 Guppies, for example, have a so-called contrast ratio of .8, which means they can\
 distinguish at a glance between four guppies and five, or eight guppies and ten, and if given\
 (line 35) the chance will swim toward the slightly fishier crowd.\
 Three-spined sticklebacks (sticklebacks - carnivorous fish) are more discriminating still: with a contrast ratio of .86,\
 they’re able to tell six fellow fish from seven, or 18 from 21 — a comparative power that\
 many birds, mammals and even humans might find hard to beat.\
 Despite the prevalence of math phobia, people too are born with a strong innate\
 (line 40) number sense, and numerosity is deeply embedded in many aspects of our minds and\
 culture.\
 Researchers have determined that number words for small quantities — less than five —\
 are strikingly similar across virtually every language studied, and the words are among the\
 most stable, unchanging utterances in any lexicon. (lexicon - language)\
 (line 45) They are more conserved through time and across cultures than words for other\
 presumably bedrock concepts like mother, father and most body parts, with a few puzzling\
 exceptions like the words for tongue and eye.\
 \"The sounds that you and I use to say ‘two’ or ‘three’ are the sounds that have been used\
 for tens of thousands of years,\" said Mark Pagel, a biologist who studies the evolution of\
 (line 50) language at the University of Reading.\
 \"It’s not out of the question that you could have been wandering around 15,000 years\
 ago and encountered a few of the last remaining Neanderthals, pointed to yourself and said,\
 ‘one,’ and pointed to them and said, ‘three,’ and those words, in an odd, coarse way, would\
 have been understood.\"\
 (line 55) That continuity, Dr. Pagel added, \"should astonish us.\" …\
 Attitudes about animal numerosity have changed dramatically since the mid-twentieth\
 century when many researchers believed only humans had enough gray matter to think\
 quantitatively. They cited as an object lesson the 1907 case of Clever Hans, the horse that\
 supposedly could solve arithmetic problems and would tap out his answers by hoof; as it\
 (line 60) turned out, he was responding to unconscious cues from the people around him.\
 Since then, researchers have approached the field with caution and rigor, seeking to\
 identify the specific evolutionary pressures that might spur the need for numeric judgments\
 in any given species.\
 Social carnivores like spotted hyenas, for example, live in fission-fusion societies, (fission-fusion societies - animals whose social group composition and size change as they move throughout their environment)\
 (line 65) collectively defending their territories against rivals but in ever-shifting groups of widely\
 roaming members. \"You can never predict who you’ll find in which group,\" said Sarah\
 Benson-Amram, an assistant professor of zoology and physiology at the University of\
 Wyoming. \"You might be alone or in a group of ten.\"\
 Because hyena jaws can pulverize zebra bones, encounters between [rival hyena]\
 (line 70) competitors can prove deadly; every spotted hyena must have a good sense from moment\
 to moment of how many there are of us versus how many of them. Dr. Benson-Amram and\
 her colleagues tested hyena numerosity skills in the field, playing back the recorded whoops\
 of spotted hyenas living in South Africa and Namibia to hyenas in Kenya.\
 The Kenyan carnivores reacted to the whoops of strangers as predicted, approaching\
 (line 75)\
 the hidden source of the sound when they had a home team advantage, retreating when\
 they heard a few too many distinctive voices in a row. Or sometimes, when the local hyenas\
 were outnumbered, they’d call for backup. …\
 Chimpanzees are social scorekeepers, episodic (episodic - periodic) warriors and number ninjas, too.\
 They can be taught to associate groups of objects with corresponding Arabic numerals up\
 (line 80) to the number 9 and sometimes beyond — three squares on a computer screen with the\
 number 3, five squares with 5, and so on. They can put those numerals in order.\
 The numeric working memory of young chimpanzees is astonishing: Flash a random\
 scattering of numerals on a screen for just 210 milliseconds — half an eye blink — and then\
 cover the numbers with white squares, and a numerically schooled young chimpanzee will\
 (line 85) touch the squares sequentially to indicate the ascending order of the numbers hidden\
 beneath.\
 Don’t bother trying to do this yourself, Tetsuro Matsuzawa, a primatologist at Kyoto\
 University, said at the scientific meeting in London on which the themed journal (the themed journal - a publication where animal numerosity studies were discussed) was based.\
 \"You can’t.\" …\
 (line 90) Stanislas Dehaene, a psychologist at the University of Paris, and his colleagues\
 presented evidence from brain scans of professional mathematicians that the neural\
 circuitry (neural circuitry - nerve cells) for advanced mathematical thinking is an elaboration on the archaic (archaic - primitive) number sense\
 we share with other animals. …\
 We hear that the price of something rose by 50 percent and then fell by 50 percent, and\
 (line 95) we reflexively, mistakenly conclude, \"Oh good, we’re back to where we started.\" Our natural\
 number sense adds and subtracts whole numbers, whole chucks, guppies and hyenas.\
 But it really abhors a fraction, and so has led us astray.\

. . . Yet in recent months something has changed. Kim Jong Il, whose regime was responsible for the first test and who died in 2011, had only a rudimentary [basic] nuclear device, useful mainly for blackmail. Under his son, Kim Jong Un, the programme has rapidly gathered pace, with two nuclear tests this year alone. The North has also conducted 21 missile tests this year, including one from a submarine—a first. The ability to miniaturise a tactical nuclear weapon on a working missile could be just two or three years away, with an intercontinental ballistic missile capable of hitting California possible in five years’ time. Chun Yung-woo, a South Korean former national security adviser, talks of “growing outrage. . .after five tests, a change of mood, a sense of urgency.”\
 \
 Once, it was possible to hope that the North’s isolated regime would implode [fail] under its own contradictions before it gained a proper nuclear capability. But the spread of informal markets and, for some North Koreans, a measure of prosperity may have strengthened the regime’s chances of survival. A consensus in Seoul is forming that Mr Kim now aims to dictate events on the peninsula—including the ability to demand that the Americans leave. One senior foreign diplomat in Seoul says that for the first time he hears people wondering openly whether there will be a major conflict on the peninsula in their lifetime. . . .\

This excerpt is from a book about the history of the Hudson River.\
 \
 Excerpt from River of Dreams\
 by Hudson Talbott\
 \
 (paragraph 1) By the twentieth century, New York City had long since reached its destiny of\
 becoming the most powerful city in America. In less than 300 years it had grown from\
 a tiny Dutch outpost in the wilderness to the business capital of the world. It was a city\
 built on dreams.\
 (paragraph 2) But it was made out of bricks and cement that had come from the banks of the\
 Hudson. The river which had fed all those dreams was now fading into the background.\
 New York didn’t seem to need the river anymore, except as a sewer. And that’s what it\
 became.\
 (paragraph 3) Industry on the river had made some New Yorkers filthy rich. But it had just made\
 the river filthy. Garbage, factory waste, plant chemicals and the raw sewage of the cities\
 and towns along its banks were dumped directly into the river. The water turned\
 greenish brown, except by the GM plant, where it turned red or yellow or whatever\
 color they were painting the cars that day.\
 (paragraph 4) The fishing industry collapsed. The few fish that survived were too poisonous to eat.\
 Smog from the factory smoke and dust from the cement plants blanketed the valley.\
 And it was all legal.\
 (paragraph 5) Most people don’t start out with dreams of polluting a river. But it was often the\
 result of people chasing their dreams of wealth with little care of how they reached it.\
 The Hudson Valley had always drawn them.\
 (paragraph 6) But now there were other dreamers in the valley, with their own dreams of wealth.\
 They dreamed of the wealth of wildlife in a healthy forest, the abundance of fish in\
 oxygen-rich water, and the great fortune of living in a beautiful river valley.\
 (paragraph 7) So perhaps it was a matter of time before the two types of dreamers would meet each\
 other—in court.\
 (paragraph 8) In 1963, Con Edison, New York City’s power company, proposed a plan for\
 constructing the largest hydroelectric pumping station ever built. The plan called for\
 carving out a gigantic hole in the side of majestic Storm King Mountain on the Hudson\
 River.\
 (paragraph 9) But then they met Franny Reese. Franny was a longtime valley resident with a simple\
 point to make: the mountain could not speak for itself. If she didn’t speak for it, who\
 would?\
 (paragraph 10) Franny and a group of like-minded people founded Scenic Hudson and took on the\
 power company in a landmark court case. Con Ed challenged the right of private\
 citizens to participate, but the court sided with the citizens, in the ruling now known as\
 the Scenic Hudson Decision.\
 (paragraph 11) After dragging out the case for seventeen years, Con Ed finally gave up and Storm\
 King survived unblemished. It was the beginning of the environmental movement in\
 this country, and once again, the Hudson Valley was the birthplace.\
 (paragraph 12) More and more people joined the movement as they realized how much difference\
 each of us can make.\
 (paragraph 13) The love of their land was still alive in the hearts of Americans, and now that it was\
 aroused again, things began to change.\
 (paragraph 14) Many new laws and new citizens’ groups have been inspired by those early heroes of\
 the environment, and their work has begun to bring the Hudson back to life.\
 (paragraph 15) The Mahicans called it “The River That Flows Both Ways.” Slowly we are learning\
 that taking care of the river is the only way that the river can take care of us.\
 (paragraph 16) Fifty years have passed since I dreamed of going to New York to see the river that\
 shares my name, and thirty-five years since that dream came true. I live in the Hudson\
 Valley now, grateful to all those who came before me, following their dreams to this\
 river, building this nation, sharing its beauty, securing its future.\
 (paragraph 17) It’s now my turn to help in keeping the river of dreams flowing, for all those\
 dreamers yet to come.\
Which quotation best expresses the author’s point of view in the article?\
(A) “In less than 300 years it had grown from a tiny Dutch outpost in the wilderness to the business capital of the world.” (paragraph 1)\
 (B) “In 1963, Con Edison, New York City’s power company, proposed a plan for constructing the largest hydroelectric pumping station ever built.” (paragraph 8)\
 (C) “More and more people joined the movement as they realized how much difference each of us can make.” (paragraph 12)\

Excerpt from “The Beadwork” from American Indian Stories\
 \
 by Zitkala-Sa\
 \
 (paragraph 1) Soon after breakfast mother sometimes began her beadwork. On a bright, clear day, she pulled out the wooden pegs that pinned the skirt of our wigwam to the ground, and rolled the canvas part way up on its frame of slender poles. Then the cool morning breezes swept freely through our dwelling, now and then wafting the perfume of sweet grasses from the newly burnt prairie.\
 \
 (paragraph 2) Untying the long tasseled strings that bound a small brown buckskin bag, my mother spread upon a mat beside her bunches of colored beads, just as an artist arranges the paints upon his palette. On a lapboard she smoothed out a double sheet of soft white buckskin; and drawing from a beaded case that hung on the left of her wide\
 belt a long, narrow blade, she trimmed the buckskin into shape. Often she worked upon small moccasins for her small daughter. Then I became intensely interested in her designing. With a proud, beaming face, I watched her work. In imagination, I saw myself walking in a new pair of snugly fitting moccasins. I felt the envious eyes of my playmates upon the pretty red beads decorating my feet.\
 \
 (paragraph 3) Close beside my mother I sat on a rug, with a scrap of buckskin in one hand and an awl in the other. This was the beginning of my practical observation lessons in the art of beadwork. From a skein of finely twisted threads of silvery sinews my mother pulled out a single one. With an awl she pierced the buckskin, and skillfully threaded it with the white sinew. Picking up the tiny beads one by one, she strung them with the point of her thread, always twisting it carefully after every stitch. . . .\
 \
 (paragraph 4) Always after these confining lessons I was wild with surplus spirits, and found joyous relief in running loose in the open again. Many a summer afternoon a party of four or five of my playmates roamed over the hills with me. We each carried a light, sharpened rod about four feet long, with which we pried up certain sweet roots. When we had eaten all the choice roots we chanced upon, we shouldered our rods and strayed off into patches of a stalky plant under whose yellow blossoms we found little crystal drops of gum. Drop by drop we gathered this nature’s rock-candy, until each of us could boast of a lump the size of a small bird’s egg. Soon satiated (satiated - completely satisfied) with its woody flavor, we tossed away our gum, to return again to the sweet roots.\
 \
 (paragraph 5) I remember well how we used to exchange our necklaces, beaded belts, and sometimes even our moccasins. We pretended to offer them as gifts to one another. We delighted in impersonating our own mothers. We talked of things we had heard them say in their conversations. We imitated their various manners, even to the inflection of their voices. In the lap of the prairie we seated ourselves upon our feet, and leaning our painted cheeks in the palms of our hands, we rested our elbows on our knees, and bent forward as old women were most accustomed to do.\
 \
 (paragraph 6) While one was telling of some heroic deed recently done by a near relative, the rest of us listened attentively, and exclaimed in undertones “Han! han!” (yes! yes!) whenever the speaker paused for breath, or sometimes for our sympathy. As the discourse became more thrilling, according to our ideas, we raised our voices in these interjections. In these impersonations our parents were led to say only those things that were in common favor.\
 \
 (paragraph 7) No matter how exciting a tale we might be rehearsing, the mere shifting of a cloud shadow in the landscape near by was sufficient to change our impulses; and soon we were all chasing the great shadows that played among the hills. We shouted and whooped in the chase; laughing and calling to one another, we were like little sportive nymphs (sportive nymphs - playful creatures of the woods) on that Dakota sea of rolling green.\
 \
 (paragraph 8) On one occasion I forgot the cloud shadow in a strange notion to catch up with my own shadow. Standing straight and still, I began to glide after it, putting out one foot cautiously. When, with the greatest care, I set my foot in advance of myself, my shadow crept onward too. Then again I tried it; this time with the other foot. Still again my shadow escaped me. I began to run; and away flew my shadow, always just a step beyond me. Faster and faster I ran, setting my teeth and clenching my fists, determined to overtake my own fleet shadow. But ever swifter it glided before me while I was growing breathless and hot. Slackening my speed, I was greatly vexed that my shadow should check its pace also. Daring it to the utmost, as I thought, I sat down upon a rock imbedded in the hillside.\
 \
 (paragraph 9) So! my shadow had the impudence (impudence - nerve) to sit down beside me!\
 \
 (paragraph 10) Now my comrades caught up with me, and began to ask why I was running away so fast.\
 \
 (paragraph 11) “Oh, I was chasing my shadow! Didn’t you ever do that?” I inquired, surprised that they should not understand.\
 \
 (paragraph 12) They planted their moccasined feet firmly upon my shadow to stay it, and I arose. Again my shadow slipped away, and moved as often as I did. Then we gave up trying to catch my shadow.\
 \
 (paragraph 13) Before this peculiar experience, I have no distinct memory of having recognized any vital bond between myself and my shadow. I never gave it an afterthought.\
 \
 (paragraph 14) Returning to our borrowed belts and trinkets, we rambled homeward. That evening, as on other evenings, I went to sleep over my legends.\

 Reading Comprehension Passage A\
 \
 The Count and the Wedding Guest\
 \
    Miss Maggie Conway and Mr. Andy Donovan are staying at the same boarding house in New York City.\
 \
    …Just coming out the door was Miss Conway. She wore a night-black dress of\
 crêpe de—crêpe de—oh, this thin black goods.(goods - fabric) Her hat was black, and from it drooped and\
 fluttered an ebon veil, filmy as a spider’s web. She stood on the top step and drew on black\
 silk gloves. Not a speck of white or a spot of color about her dress anywhere. Her rich\
 (line 5) golden hair was drawn, with scarcely a ripple, into a shining, smooth knot low on her neck.\
 Her face was plain rather than pretty, but it was now illuminated and made almost beautiful\
 by her large gray eyes that gazed above the houses across the street into the sky with an\
 expression of the most appealing sadness and melancholy. …\
    “It’s a fine, clear evening, Miss Conway,” he [Andy Donovan] said; and if the Weather\
 (line 10) Bureau could have heard the confident emphasis of his tones it would have hoisted the\
 square white signal, (square white signal - a sign of good weather) and nailed it to the mast.\
    “To them that has the heart to enjoy it, it is, Mr. Donovan,” said Miss Conway, with\
 a sigh. …\
    “I hope none of your relatives—I hope you haven’t sustained a loss?” ventured\
 (line 15) Mr. Donovan.\
    “Death has claimed,” said Miss Conway, hesitating—“not a relative, but one who—but\
 I will not intrude my grief upon you, Mr. Donovan.”\
    “Intrude?” protested Mr. Donovan. “Why, say, Miss Conway, I’d be delighted, that is,\
 I’d be sorry—I mean I’m sure nobody could sympathize with you truer than I would.”\
 (line 20)   Miss Conway smiled a little smile. And oh, it was sadder than her expression in repose. (repose - at rest) …\
    “It’s tough to be alone in New York—that’s a cinch,” said Mr. Donovan. “But, say—\
 whenever this little old town does loosen up and get friendly it goes the limit. Say you took\
 a little stroll in the park, Miss Conway—don’t you think it might chase away some of your\
 mullygrubs? And if you’d allow me—”\
 (line 25)   “Thanks, Mr. Donovan. I’d be pleased to accept of your escort if you think the company\
 of one whose heart is filled with gloom could be anyways agreeable to you.”\
    Through the open gates of the iron-railed, old, downtown park, where the elect once\
 took the air, they strolled, and found a quiet bench. …\
    “He was my fiancé,” confided Miss Conway, at the end of an hour. “We were going to\
 (line 30) be married next spring. I don’t want you to think that I am stringing you, Mr. Donovan, but\
 he was a real Count. He had an estate and a castle in Italy. Count Fernando Mazzini was\
 his name. I never saw the beat of him for elegance. Papa objected, of course, and once \
 we eloped, but papa overtook us, and took us back. I thought sure papa and Fernando \
 would fight a duel. Papa has a livery business—in P’kipsee [Poughkeepsie], you know.” … \
 (line 35)    “Three days ago I got a letter from Italy, forwarded from P’kipsee, saying that Fernando \
 had been killed in a gondola accident.” … \
    “I’ve got his picture here in my locket,” said Miss Conway, after wiping her eyes with \
 her handkerchief. “I never showed it to anybody; but I will to you, Mr. Donovan, because \
 I believe you to be a true friend.” \
 (line 40)   Mr. Donovan gazed long and with much interest at the photograph in the locket that \
 Miss Conway opened for him. The face of Count Mazzini was one to command interest. \
 It was a smooth, intelligent, bright, almost a handsome face—the face of a strong, cheerful \
 man who might well be a leader among his fellows. \
    “I have a larger one, framed, in my room,” said Miss Conway. “When we return I will\
 (line 45) show you that. They are all I have to remind me of Fernando. But he ever will be present \
 in my heart, that’s a sure thing.” \
    A subtle task confronted Mr. Donovan,—that of supplanting (supplanting - replacing) the unfortunate Count in \
 the heart of Miss Conway. This his admiration for her determined him to do. But the \
 magnitude of the undertaking did not seem to weigh upon his spirits. The sympathetic but\
 (line 50) cheerful friend was the role he essayed; (essayed - attempted) and he played it so successfully that the next \
 half-hour found them conversing pensively across two plates of ice-cream, though yet there \
 was no diminution of the sadness in Miss Conway’s large gray eyes. \
    Before they parted in the hall that evening she ran upstairs and brought down the \
 framed photograph wrapped lovingly in a white silk scarf. Mr. Donovan surveyed it with\
 (line 55) inscrutable (inscrutable - unreadable) eyes. … \
    “A fine-looking man,” said Mr. Donovan, heartily. “How would it suit you, Miss Conway, \
 to give me the pleasure of your company to Coney [Island] next Sunday afternoon?” \
    A month later they announced their engagement to Mrs. Scott and the other boarders. \
 Miss Conway continued to wear black.\
 (line 60)   A week after the announcement the two sat on the same bench in the downtown park, \
 while the fluttering leaves of the trees made a dim kinetoscopic (kinetoscopic - flickering) picture of them in the \
 moonlight. But Donovan had worn a look of abstracted gloom all day. He was so silent \
 to-night that love’s lips could not keep back any longer the questions that love’s heart \
 propounded. (propounded - put forward)\
 (line 65)   “What’s the matter, Andy, you are so solemn and grouchy to-night?”\
    “Nothing, Maggie.”\
    “I know better. Can’t I tell? You never acted this way before. What is it?” … \
    “I’ll tell you then,” said Andy, wisely, “but I guess you won’t understand it exactly. \
 You’ve heard of Mike Sullivan, haven’t you? ‘Big Mike’ Sullivan, everybody calls him.”\
 (line 70)   “No, I haven’t,” said Maggie. “And I don’t want to, if he makes you act like this. Who is \
 he?” …\
    “Well, Big Mike’s a friend of mine. I ain’t more than deuce-high in the district as far as \
 influence goes, but Mike’s as good a friend to a little man, or a poor man as he is to a big \
 one. I met him to-day on the Bowery [Street], and what do you think he does? Comes up\
 (line 75) and shakes hands. ‘Andy,’ says he, ‘I’ve been keeping cases on you. You’ve been putting in \
 some good licks over on your side of the street, and I’m proud of you. What’ll you take to \
 drink?’ He takes a cigar, and I take a highball. I told him I was going to get married in two \
 weeks. ‘Andy,’ says he, ‘send me an invitation, so I’ll keep in mind of it, and I’ll come to the \
 wedding.’ That’s what Big Mike says to me; and he always does what he says. \
 (line 80)   “You don’t understand it, Maggie, but I’d have one of my hands cut off to have Big Mike \
 Sullivan at our wedding. It would be the proudest day of my life. When he goes to a man’s \
 wedding, there’s a guy being married that’s made for life. Now, that’s why I’m maybe looking \
 sore to-night.”\
    “Why don’t you invite him, then, if he’s so much to the mustard?” (to the mustard - successful) said Maggie, lightly. …\
 (line 85)   “Maggie,” said Andy, presently, “do you think as much of me as you did of your—as you \
 did of the Count Mazzini?”\
    He waited a long time, but Maggie did not reply. And then, suddenly she leaned against \
 his shoulder and began to cry—to cry and shake with sobs, holding his arm tightly, and \
 wetting the crêpe de Chine with tears. …\
 (line 90)   But instead of being pushed away, she found Andy’s arm folding her closer. She looked \
 up and saw his face cleared and smiling. …\
    “Andy,” said Maggie, with a somewhat shy smile, after she had been thoroughly assured \
 of forgiveness, “did you believe all that story about the Count?” \
    “Well, not to any large extent,” said Andy, reaching for his cigar case, “because it’s\
 (line 95) Big Mike Sullivan’s picture you’ve got in that locket of yours.” \

 Then try harder.\
 Lunge forward, press eagerly for release.\
 The amazement which awaits is for you.\

 We are ourselves Amazement.\

Reading Comprehension Passage C\
 \
 Get That Song Outta My Head!\
 \
    The nightmare began when my husband walked into our kitchen and said, “I’ve had this\
 song stuck in my head all day …”\
    No! I thought. Don’t say it!\
    “Remember that song from the original Karate Kid movie?” he continued.\
 (line 5)   For the love of God, no!\
    “You know how it goes. ‘You’re the best around … na na na na na, na na na na. You’re\
 the best around …”\
    It was too late. Now I had an earworm — a song, melody or jingle that gets stuck in your\
 head.\
 (line 10)   The worst part? I only knew that same line. I walked around humming it for days. I tried\
 to shake it by singing along with tunes playing on my car radio while I was out running\
 errands. For a brief time, Van Halen’s “Runnin’ With the Devil” replaced it.\
    But in no time at all, that one line from “You’re the Best,” sung by Joe Esposito on the\
 The Karate Kid soundtrack, was back.\
 (line 15)   Perhaps if I heard more of the song in my head, it wouldn’t be as annoying. But just this\
 one line? Over and over and over again? It was pure torture. I needed to do something\
 drastic. I busted out that 1980s hit, “The Safety Dance” by Men Without Hats. After singing\
 it a few times, the earworm was gone.\
    I knew I’d get another one, though. About 90 percent of people experience earworms\
 (line 20) at least once a week, according to the Earworm Project run by the Music, Mind and Brain\
 group at Goldsmiths, University of London.\
    “Music lovers, specifically people who ascribe (ascribe - credit) more importance to music or people\
 who spend more time listening to music, have more frequent and longer earworm\
 episodes,” says Kelly Jakubowski, a researcher with the Earworm Project. …\
 (line 25)   To find out what causes earworms and how to get rid of them, I contacted the man\
 known as “Dr. Earworm,” James Kellaris, a marketing professor at the University of\
 Cincinnati. Certainly with a nickname like that, he would know something.\
    Kellaris began studying earworms in 1999. A former professional musician prone to\
 getting earworms himself, he eventually became a marketing professor “interested in how\
 (line 30) marketers use music to achieve various commercial goals,” he says. “It was a perfect storm\
 to create an earworms researcher.”\
    He explained to me that when we get an earworm, the tune seems to repeat itself\
 involuntarily, which is why experts consider earworms involuntary musical imagery (INMI).\
 This was exactly what “You’re the Best” had done to me.\
 (line 35)   So what, precisely, was happening in my brain when I couldn’t shake that tune?\
 Jakubowski contributed to a May 2015 study led by Nicolas Farrugia, a postdoctoral\
 researcher with the Earworm Project, that demonstrated auditory and inhibitory-related\
 areas play a role in earworms as well.\
    The researchers examined 44 healthy subjects, all between 25 and 70 years old and all\
 (line 40) participants of a past neuroimaging study run by the Cambridge Medical Research\
 Council’s Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit. These subjects took an online survey that\
 measured both the extent of their musical training and how strongly INMIs impacted them.\
 For example, the survey wanted to know how strong of a negative impact INMIs had on\
 them or if INMIs were actually helpful while they went about their everyday activities.\
 (line 45)   When they examined these participants’ brain images, one pattern in particular stuck\
 out: People who got earworms more often had a thinner right frontal cortex, which is\
 involved in inhibition, (inhibition -restraining behavior) and a thinner temporal cortex, which processes sensory stimuli like\
 sound. In other words, these people’s brains just weren’t as good at suppressing the random\
 song that might pop into their heads.\
 (line 50)   Why we get earworms, unfortunately, remains a scientific mystery. “We know that songs\
 that are ‘catchy’ — short, simple, repetitive and contain some incongruity — are most likely\
 to get stuck,” Kellaris says. Most people are more likely to get a song like “Don’t Worry, Be\
 Happy” stuck in their heads than, say, a Mahler symphony. And some things exacerbate\
 them: frequency and duration of exposure to music, worry, stress, fatigue and idleness.\
 (line 55)   Considering that my husband kept singing the snippet (snippet - short piece) while I was tired and stressed,\
 I can see why it got stuck. But my earworms have been relatively innocuous. (innocuous - harmless) Even though\
 they’re annoying, I can eventually get rid of them. Some people can’t, though.\
    Part of Kellaris’ earliest research involved mailing a questionnaire to about 1,000\
 respondents at four U.S. universities. He asked them if they’d ever had an earworm, for how\
 (line 60) long, how often it happened, how it made them feel, etc.\
    One respondent claimed to have had a song stuck in his head since 1978. This is known\
 as intrusive musical imagery (IMI), a musical obsession that’s chronic and highly distracting\
 to a person’s everyday life and work. According to Dean McKay, a psychology professor at\
 Fordham University, my short-lived earworm was nothing compared to an IMI.\
 (line 65)   But now I was concerned. Could my future earworms turn into these IMIs? Is there a\
 way to prevent this from happening?\
    McKay co-authored a June 2014 study titled “Musical obsessions: A comprehensive\
 review of neglected clinical phenomena.” For this study, McKay and other international\
 colleagues, all of whom treat obsessive-compulsive disorder, created the first\
 (line 70) comprehensive review of musical obsessions. They compiled a database of 96 case study\
 descriptions of people with severe musical obsessions — the largest compilation (compilation - collection) assembled\
 on this topic. They determined the characteristics of musical obsessions such as IMIs and\
 compared them with earworms, musical hallucinations and visual obsessional imagery.\
    The group’s research showed that IMIs can be treated by using a method known as\
 (line 75) distraction — coming up with a competing melody to think about that would get rid of the\
 IMI. That’s exactly what I had done, albeit unknowingly, when I used “The Safety Dance”\
 to stop my earworm.\
    McKay says my earworm was pesky because I knew only that one part of the song. He\
 suggests if I have just a portion of a song looping in my brain in the future, I can try another\
 (line 80) method called exposure — simply listening to the entire song. “It’s like a completion task,”\
 he says. “Once you know the whole song, then there’s no need for it to be stuck in your\
 head.”\
    Another form of distraction is to sing the song out loud, but change some of the words\
 or slightly throw off the melody. One of McKay’s patients had an IMI based on a Taylor\
 (line 85) Swift song. “We made up some other words for it,” he explains. “We messed up the melody\
 a bit, but not so much that it wasn’t recognizable as still being that song, and then it faded.”\
 McKay stresses that this is the only case he’s tried this in, so it’s not a forgone conclusion\
 this kind of distraction would work in other instances.\
    What I wanted to know was if the earworm I get today could become the IMI of\
 (line 90) tomorrow.\
    “Highly improbable,” he says.\
    “You’re the best,” I reply.\
    Oh no.\

Reading Comprehension Passage A\
 \
 The factory made the best centrifugal pumps in the world, and Merle Waggoner owned\
 it. He’d started it. He’d just been offered two million dollars for it by the General Forge and\
 Foundry Company. He didn’t have any stockholders and he didn’t owe a dime. He was\
 fifty-one, a widower, and he had one heir—a son. The boy’s name was Franklin. The boy\
 (line 5) was named after Benjamin Franklin.\
 \
 One Friday afternoon father and son came out of Merle’s office and into the factory.\
 They went down a factory aisle to Rudy Linberg’s lathe. (lathe — a machine on which a piece of material, such as wood or metal, is spun and shaped against a fixed\
 cutting tool)\
 \
 “Rudy,” said Merle, “the boy here’s home from college for three days, and I thought\
 maybe you and him and your boy and me might go out to the farm and shoot some clay\
 (line 10) pigeons tomorrow.”\
 \
 Rudy turned his sky-blue eyes to Merle and young Franklin. He was Merle’s age, and\
 he had the deep and narrow dignity of a man who had learned his limitations early—who\
 had never tried to go beyond them. His limitations were those of his tools, his flute and his\
 shotgun. …\
 \
 (line 15) “Let’s go ask my boy what he’s got on tomorrow,” said Rudy. It was a formality. Karl\
 always did what his father wanted him to do—did it with profound love. …\
 \
 Karl was a carbon copy of his father. He was such a good mimic of Rudy that his joints\
 seemed to ache a little with age. He seemed sobered by fifty-one years of life, though he’d\
 lived only twenty. He seemed instinctively wary of safety hazards that had been eliminated\
 (line 20) from the factory by the time he’d learned to walk. Karl stood at attention without humility,\
 just as his father had done.\
 \
 “Want to go shooting tomorrow?” said Rudy.\
 “Shoot what?” said Karl.\
 “Crows. Clay pigeons,” said Rudy. “Maybe a woodchuck.”\
 \
 (line 25)“Don’t mind,” said Karl. He nodded briefly to Merle and Franklin. “Glad to.” …\
 Rudy nodded. He examined the work in Karl’s lathe and tapped his own temple. The\
 tapping was a signal that Franklin had seen many times on hunts. It meant that Karl was\
 doing fine.\
 \
 Rudy touched Karl’s elbow lightly. It was the signal for Karl to get back to work. Rudy\
 (line 30) and Karl each held up a crooked finger and saluted with it. Franklin knew what that meant\
 too. It meant, “Good-by, I love you.” …\
 \
 Merle was sitting at his desk, his head down, when Franklin came in. He held a steel\
 plate about six inches square in his left hand. In the middle of the plate was a hole two inches\
 square. In his right hand he held a steel cube that fitted the hole exactly. …\
 \
 (line 35) Franklin sat down gingerly on a hard chair by the wall. The office hadn’t changed much\
 in the years he’d known it. It was one more factory room, with naked pipes overhead—the\
 cold ones sweaty, the hot ones dry. Wires snaked from steel box to steel box. The green walls\
 and cream trim were as rough as elephant hide in some places, with alternating coats of\
 paint and grime, paint and grime.\
 \
 (line 40) There had never been time to scrape away the layers, and barely enough time,\
 overnight, to slap on new paint. And there had never been time in which to finish the rough\
 shelves that lined the room. …\
 \
 Merle slipped the cube through the square hole once more. “Know what these are?” he\
 said.\
 \
 (line 45) “Yes, sir,” said Franklin. “They’re what Rudy Linberg had to make when he was an\
 apprentice in Sweden.”\
 The cube could be slipped through the hole in twenty-four different ways, without\
 letting the tiniest ray of light pass through with it.\
 \
 “Unbelievable skill,” said Franklin respectfully. “There aren’t craftsmen like that\
 (line 50) coming along any more.” He didn’t really feel much respect. He was simply saying what he\
 knew his father wanted to hear. The cube and the hole struck him as criminal wastes of time\
 and great bores. “Unbelievable,” he said again.\
 \
 “It’s utterly unbelievable, when you realize that Rudy didn’t make them,” said Merle\
 gravely, “when you realize what generation the man who made them belongs to.”\
 \
 (line 55) “Oh?” said Franklin. “Who did make them?”\
 \
 “Rudy’s boy, Karl,” said Merle. “A member of your generation.” He ground out his cigar\
 sadly. “He gave them to me on my last birthday. They were on my desk, boy, waiting for me\
 when I came in—right beside the ones Rudy gave me thirty-one years before.” …\
 \
 “I could have cried, boy, when I saw those two plates and those two cubes side by side,”\
 (line 60) said Merle. “Can you understand that?” he asked beseechingly. “Can you understand why\
 I’d feel like crying?” …\
 \
 “The cube of Karl’s fitted through the hole of Rudy’s!” said Merle. “They were\
 interchangeable!”\
 \
 “Gosh!” said Franklin. “I’ll be darned. Really?”\
 \
 (line 65) And now he felt like crying, because he didn’t care, couldn’t care—and would have\
 given his right arm to care. The factory whanged and banged and screeched in monstrous\
 irrelevance—Franklin’s, all Franklin’s, if he just said the word.\
 \
 “What’ll you do with it—buy a theater in New York?” said Merle abruptly.\
 \
 “Do with what, sir?” said Franklin.\
 \
 (line 70) “The money I’ll get for the factory when I sell it—the money I’ll leave to you when I’m\
 dead,” said Merle. He hit the word “dead” hard. “What’s Waggoner Pump going to be\
 converted into? Waggoner Theaters? Waggoner School of Acting? The Waggoner Home for\
 Broken-Down Actors?”\
 \
 “I—I hadn’t thought about it,” said Franklin. The idea of converting Waggoner Pump\
 (line 75) into something equally complicated hadn’t occurred to him, and appalled him now. He was\
 being asked to match his father’s passion for the factory with an equal passion for something\
 else. And Franklin had no such passion—for the theater or anything else. …\
 \
 “Don’t sell on my account,” said Franklin wretchedly.\
 \
 “On whose account would I keep it?” said Merle.\
 \
 (line 80) “Do you have to sell it today?” said Franklin, horrified.\
 \
 “Strike while the iron’s hot, I always say,” said Merle. “Today’s the day you decided to\
 be an actor, and, as luck would have it, we have an excellent offer for what I did with my\
 life.”\
 \
 “Couldn’t we wait?”\
 \
 (line 85) “For what?” said Merle. He was having a good time now.\
 \
 “Father!” cried Franklin. “For the love of heaven, father, please!” He hung his head and\
 shook it. “I don’t know what I’m doing,” he said brokenly. “I don’t know for sure what I want\
 to do yet. I’m just playing with ideas, trying to find myself. Please, father, don’t sell what\
 you’ve done with your life, don’t just throw it away because I’m not sure I want to do that\
 (line 90) with my life too! Please!” Franklin looked up. “I’m not Karl Linberg,” he said. “I can’t help\
 it. I’m sorry, but I’m not Karl Linberg.” …\

This excerpt is from a book about the history of the Hudson River.\
 \
 Excerpt from River of Dreams\
 by Hudson Talbott\
 \
 (paragraph 1) By the twentieth century, New York City had long since reached its destiny of\
 becoming the most powerful city in America. In less than 300 years it had grown from\
 a tiny Dutch outpost in the wilderness to the business capital of the world. It was a city\
 built on dreams.\
 (paragraph 2) But it was made out of bricks and cement that had come from the banks of the\
 Hudson. The river which had fed all those dreams was now fading into the background.\
 New York didn’t seem to need the river anymore, except as a sewer. And that’s what it\
 became.\
 (paragraph 3) Industry on the river had made some New Yorkers filthy rich. But it had just made\
 the river filthy. Garbage, factory waste, plant chemicals and the raw sewage of the cities\
 and towns along its banks were dumped directly into the river. The water turned\
 greenish brown, except by the GM plant, where it turned red or yellow or whatever\
 color they were painting the cars that day.\
 (paragraph 4) The fishing industry collapsed. The few fish that survived were too poisonous to eat.\
 Smog from the factory smoke and dust from the cement plants blanketed the valley.\
 And it was all legal.\
 (paragraph 5) Most people don’t start out with dreams of polluting a river. But it was often the\
 result of people chasing their dreams of wealth with little care of how they reached it.\
 The Hudson Valley had always drawn them.\
 (paragraph 6) But now there were other dreamers in the valley, with their own dreams of wealth.\
 They dreamed of the wealth of wildlife in a healthy forest, the abundance of fish in\
 oxygen-rich water, and the great fortune of living in a beautiful river valley.\
 (paragraph 7) So perhaps it was a matter of time before the two types of dreamers would meet each\
 other—in court.\
 (paragraph 8) In 1963, Con Edison, New York City’s power company, proposed a plan for\
 constructing the largest hydroelectric pumping station ever built. The plan called for\
 carving out a gigantic hole in the side of majestic Storm King Mountain on the Hudson\
 River.\
 (paragraph 9) But then they met Franny Reese. Franny was a longtime valley resident with a simple\
 point to make: the mountain could not speak for itself. If she didn’t speak for it, who\
 would?\
 (paragraph 10) Franny and a group of like-minded people founded Scenic Hudson and took on the\
 power company in a landmark court case. Con Ed challenged the right of private\
 citizens to participate, but the court sided with the citizens, in the ruling now known as\
 the Scenic Hudson Decision.\
 (paragraph 11) After dragging out the case for seventeen years, Con Ed finally gave up and Storm\
 King survived unblemished. It was the beginning of the environmental movement in\
 this country, and once again, the Hudson Valley was the birthplace.\
 (paragraph 12) More and more people joined the movement as they realized how much difference\
 each of us can make.\
 (paragraph 13) The love of their land was still alive in the hearts of Americans, and now that it was\
 aroused again, things began to change.\
 (paragraph 14) Many new laws and new citizens’ groups have been inspired by those early heroes of\
 the environment, and their work has begun to bring the Hudson back to life.\
 (paragraph 15) The Mahicans called it “The River That Flows Both Ways.” Slowly we are learning\
 that taking care of the river is the only way that the river can take care of us.\
 (paragraph 16) Fifty years have passed since I dreamed of going to New York to see the river that\
 shares my name, and thirty-five years since that dream came true. I live in the Hudson\
 Valley now, grateful to all those who came before me, following their dreams to this\
 river, building this nation, sharing its beauty, securing its future.\
 (paragraph 17) It’s now my turn to help in keeping the river of dreams flowing, for all those\
 dreamers yet to come.\
What is the role of paragraph 7 in the organization of the article?\
(A) It compares the two groups of dreamers.\
 (B) It concludes the part of the article about industry.\
 (C) It introduces the part of the article about activists.\
 (D) It transitions to the part of the article where change occurs.\

Protecting Nesting Habitats\
 \
 Sea turtles repeatedly return to the same beach to nest and there is no parental care once the eggs have been deposited in the nest. Therefore, the characteristics of the nest determine whether the eggs will survive or not. The mother turtle must choose her nest site carefully. Nests farther inland are more likely to dry out, and due to the distance that the hatchlings have to travel to reach the sea, there is a greater chance that they will be preyed upon. Nests too close to the sea are more likely to be damaged by erosion or flooding.\
 Two endangered turtle species are regularly found around Akumal, a popular tourist destination in the Caribbean. The local beaches are an important nesting ground for the loggerhead turtle and green turtle. The beaches are managed by a local organization that makes daily patrols to locate turtle nests and place protective barriers around them. Night patrols ensure that turtle nests are not disturbed by tourists. Local residents have agreed to minimize light pollution by closing all shops, bars, and restaurants before 11 p.m., and local fishermen and tour boats avoid areas of sea grasses that are roped off, so that feeding turtles will not be disturbed.\
 The data table on the next page shows the results of efforts to increase the numbers of loggerhead and green turtles.\
 \
 Turtle Hatching Success\
 Year | Number of Turtle Hatchlings (in thousands)\
  | Green Turtles | Loggerhead Turtles\
 2006 | 8 | 4.5\
 2007 | 6 | 8\
 2008 | 18 | 10\
 2009 | 11 | 9\
 2010 | 29 | 8\
 2011 | 23 | 10\
 2012 | 43 | 14\
 \
 A trade-off was made by the local population that has increased the number of turtles in the area. Which statement best describes the trade-off?\
(1) Placing barriers around the turtle nests made it easier for tourists to find and photograph them.\
 (2) The night patrols kept tourists from raiding the turtle nests and selling the eggs.\
 (3) The shops, bars, and restaurants agreed to close early, even though they could lose customers, so that the turtles could have a better chance to nest successfully.\
 (4) Local fishermen agreed to stay away from certain fishing areas and catch fewer fish so that the tour boats could bring tourists into the sea-grass areas.\

Excerpt from Wheels of Change: How Women Rode the Bicycle to Freedom (With a Few Flat Tires Along the Way)\
 by Sue Macy\
 \
 (paragraph 1) Women’s rights crusader Elizabeth Cady Stanton was in her eighties during the\
 heyday of the bicycle, and no evidence exists to show that she actually ever rode one.\
 But there was no better or more eloquent advocate for women and the wheel. In 1895,\
 Stanton contributed an article to the American Wheelman celebrating this “wonderful\
 new style of locomotion.” In the article, titled “The Era of the Bicycle,” she pointed out\
 that cycling was increasing people’s mobility, eliminating the cost of feeding and\
 housing horses, and encouraging the building of good roads. However, she saved her\
 greatest praise for the bicycle’s effects on women. “The bicycle,” she wrote, “will inspire\
 women with more courage, self-respect and self-reliance and make the next generation\
 more vigorous of mind and of body; for feeble mothers do not produce great\
 statesmen, scientists and scholars.”\
 (paragraph 2) For all the practical benefits of the two-wheeler, the fact is that it brought about a\
 cosmic shift in women’s private and public lives. With the rise of industry and the\
 move from a rural to an urban economy in the 19th century, American women had\
 become increasingly confined to their homes. Young girls could play outside, but when\
 they matured, their freedom of movement was greatly restricted. “At sixteen years of\
 age, I was enwrapped in the long skirts that impeded every footstep,” remembered\
 Frances Willard, who in 1895 wrote a best-selling account of how she learned to ride a\
 bicycle at age 53. “I have detested walking and felt with a certain noble disdain that the\
 conventions of life had cut me off from what . . . had been one of life’s sweetest joys.”\
 (paragraph 3) While wealthier women were saddled with long skirts and restrictive corsets, those\
 who were less well off worked anonymously in mills and factories. All in all, the result\
 was the same. Except in a few instances, the public image of America was male.\
 Politicians, soldiers, business leaders, and even the leading athletes in the new sports of\
 baseball and football were all men. But the bicycle changed that. Suddenly, women\
 were leaving their homes to cycle and socialize on country roads and city streets.\
 Bicycle racers such as Louise Armaindo and Frankie Nelson had their exploits splashed\
 all over the papers. Bicycle manufacturers, intent on mining an untapped market,\
 showed female models in their advertisements. Thanks to the wheel, women were\
 starting to be seen and heard in public life.\
 (paragraph 4) It was not a stretch for some cyclists to see the possibility of a larger role for women\
 in the world. When she conquered the wheel, Frances Willard was a former university\
 president and the longtime president of the Woman’s Christian Temperance Union,\
 which fought to prohibit the use of alcoholic beverages and to win women the right to\
 vote. Willard saw parallels between learning to ride and learning to live. “I began to feel\
 that myself plus the bicycle equaled myself plus the world, upon whose spinning wheel\
 we must all learn to ride,” she wrote. “He who succeeds, or, to be more exact in handing\
 over my experience, she who succeeds in gaining the mastery of [a bicycle], will gain\
 the mastery of life.”\
 (paragraph 5) For decades, Willard, along with Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Susan B. Anthony, and\
 many others, had been working toward increased political and economic rights for\
 women. Now the bicycle brought a taste of independence to women on a very personal\
 level, and some of them took the opportunity to express their discontent with old\
 traditions and expectations. In August 1895, a cyclist named Ann Strong caused a stir\
 when she compared the value of a bicycle to that of a husband in the Minneapolis\
 Tribune. “I can’t see but that a wheel is just as good company as most husbands,” she\
 declared. “I would as lief (lief: happily) talk to one inanimate object as another; and I’d a great deal\
 rather talk to one that can’t answer than one that won’t.” Strong then contrasted the joy\
 of cycling with the challenges of raising a family. “You can make your wheel tidy over\
 night,” she said, “and it never kicks off its shoes the very last minute, and never smears\
 itself with molasses. When you are ready you can start. No little elbows are stuck in\
 your ribs; there is no wiggling; screams at the cars or at the candy stores. You glide\
 along, silently, smoothly, swiftly.”\
 (paragraph 6) Some stated the liberating effects of the bicycle with less sarcasm. “The bicycle has\
 brought to women a healthful, wholesome means of securing a degree of freedom and\
 independence that no amount of discussion regarding ‘women’s rights’ would ever\
 have produced,” wrote the L.A.W. Bulletin and Good Roads magazine in 1898.\
 Meanwhile, Munsey’s Magazine assessed the impact of the wheel on women in a\
 special bicycle-themed issue. “If she has ridden her bicycle into new fields, becoming in\
 the process a new creature, it has been gradually and unconsciously,” the editors wrote.\
 (paragraph 7) “She did not have to be born again in some mysterious fashion, becoming a strange\
 creature, a ‘new woman.’ She is more like the ‘eternal feminine,’ who has taken on\
 wings, and who is using them with an ever increasing delight in her new power.”\
 Indeed, many bicycle companies at home and abroad did put wings on the women in\
 their advertisements, emphasizing that they had taken flight.\
 (paragraph 8) Not all publications treated the emergence of the “new woman” with the same level\
 of approval. Some mocked her, while others just seemed baffled by her. Her new way of\
 dressing, in bloomers or divided skirts or skirts with shortened hems, certainly\
 disturbed the old social order, but so did her confidence and daring. These traits led\
 commentators to worry that the differences between the sexes were being blurred, a\
 fear that was reinforced as the four newest states—Wyoming, Colorado, Utah, and\
 Idaho—granted women the right to vote in the 1890s. Would the bicycle help bring\
 about a new kind of equality between men and women? Elizabeth Cady Stanton and\
 her colleagues certainly hoped so. At any rate, the image of a female cyclist quickly\
 became associated with efforts to win more rights for women.\
A distinction the author makes between Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Frances Willard is that only\
(A) Stanton wrote in favor of women riding bicycles\
 (B) Willard was actually known to ride a bicycle\
 (C) Stanton was actually criticized for riding a bicycle\
 (D) Willard was a true spokeswoman for the bicycle\

. . . In the Moghul [Mughal] empire the core contradiction had always been Hindus versus Muslims. Akbar the Great had worked out a sort of accommodation, but his great-grandson Aurangzeb reversed all his policies, enforcing orthodox Islam rigidly, restoring discrimination against Hindus, squashing smaller religious groups such as the Sikhs, and generally replacing tolerance with repression. And yet, say what you will about the man’s narrow-minded zealotry [fanaticism], Aurangzeb was a titanic talent, so he not only held his empire together but extended it. The whole time, however, he was sowing the discord [division] and tension that would erupt to ruin the empire as soon as a less capable ruler took charge. . . .\
 \
 . . . This glimpse into the Ottoman social clockwork does not begin to exhaust its fractal intricacy [complexity]: look closer and deeper into Ottoman society and you’ll see the same order of complexity at every level. Everything was connected to everything else and connected in many ways, which was fine when all the connections balanced out and all of the parts were working. Centuries later, when the empire entered its decrepitude [decaying state], all the intertwining parts and intermeshing [connecting] institutions became a peculiarly Ottoman liability; their intricacy meant that trouble in one place or sphere translated mysteriously to trouble in a dozen other places or spheres—but that came later. In the sixteenth century, the Ottoman Empire was an awesomely well-functioning machine. . . .\

 Excerpt from The Midnight Fox\
 by Betsy Byars\
 (paragraph 1) I had just finished writing this letter and was waiting for a minute to see if I would think of anything to add when I looked up and saw the black fox.\
 (paragraph 2) I did not believe it for a minute. It was like my eyes were playing a trick or something, because I was just sort of staring across this field, thinking about my letter, and then in the distance, where the grass was very green, I saw a fox leaping over the crest of the field. The grass moved and the fox sprang toward the movement, and then, seeing that it was just the wind that had caused the grass to move, she ran straight for the grove of trees where I was sitting\
 (paragraph 3) It was so great that I wanted it to start over again, like you can turn movie film back and see yourself repeat some fine thing you have done, and I wanted to see the fox leaping over the grass again. In all my life I have never been so excited.\
 (paragraph 4) I did not move at all, but I could hear the paper in my hand shaking, and my heart seemed to have moved up in my body and got stuck in my throat.\
 (paragraph 5) The fox came straight toward the grove of trees. She wasn't afraid, and I knew she had not seen me against the tree. I stayed absolutely still even though I felt like jumping up and screaming, \"Aunt Millie! Uncle Fred! Come see this. It's a fox, a fox!\"\
 (paragraph 6) Her steps as she crossed the field were lighter and quicker than a cat's. As she came closer I could see that her black fur was tipped with white. It was as if it were midnight and the moon were shining on her fur, frosting it. The wind parted her fur as it changed directions. Suddenly she stopped. She was ten feet away now, and with the changing of the wind she had got my scent. She looked right at me.\
 (paragraph 7) I did not move for a moment and neither did she. Her head was cocked to one side, her tail curled up, her front left foot raised. In all my life I never saw anything like that fox standing there with her pale golden eyes on me and this great black fur being blown by the wind.\
 (paragraph 8) Suddenly her nose quivered. It was such a slight movement I almost didn't see it, and then her mouth opened and I could see the pink tip of her tongue. She turned. She still was not afraid, but with a bound that was lighter than the wind-it was as if she was being blown away over the field-she was gone.\
 (paragraph 9) Still I didn't move. I couldn't. I couldn't believe that I had really seen the fox.\
 (paragraph 10) I had seen foxes before in zoos, but I was always in such a great hurry to get on to the good stuff that I was saying stupid things like, \"I want to see the go-rilllllas\", and not once had I ever really looked at a fox. Still, I could never remember seeing a black fox, not even in a zoo.\
 (paragraph 11) Also, there was a great deal of difference between seeing an animal in the zoo in front of painted fake rocks and trees and seeing one natural and free in the woods. It was like seeing a kite on the floor and then, later, seeing one up in the sky where it was supposed to be, pulling at the wind.\

 Excerpt from The Midnight Fox\
 by Betsy Byars\
 (paragraph 1) I had just finished writing this letter and was waiting for a minute to see if I would think of anything to add when I looked up and saw the black fox.\
 (paragraph 2) I did not believe it for a minute. It was like my eyes were playing a trick or something, because I was just sort of staring across this field, thinking about my letter, and then in the distance, where the grass was very green, I saw a fox leaping over the crest of the field. The grass moved and the fox sprang toward the movement, and then, seeing that it was just the wind that had caused the grass to move, she ran straight for the grove of trees where I was sitting\
 (paragraph 3) It was so great that I wanted it to start over again, like you can turn movie film back and see yourself repeat some fine thing you have done, and I wanted to see the fox leaping over the grass again. In all my life I have never been so excited.\
 (paragraph 4) I did not move at all, but I could hear the paper in my hand shaking, and my heart seemed to have moved up in my body and got stuck in my throat.\
 (paragraph 5) The fox came straight toward the grove of trees. She wasn't afraid, and I knew she had not seen me against the tree. I stayed absolutely still even though I felt like jumping up and screaming, \"Aunt Millie! Uncle Fred! Come see this. It's a fox, a fox!\"\
 (paragraph 6) Her steps as she crossed the field were lighter and quicker than a cat's. As she came closer I could see that her black fur was tipped with white. It was as if it were midnight and the moon were shining on her fur, frosting it. The wind parted her fur as it changed directions. Suddenly she stopped. She was ten feet away now, and with the changing of the wind she had got my scent. She looked right at me.\
 (paragraph 7) I did not move for a moment and neither did she. Her head was cocked to one side, her tail curled up, her front left foot raised. In all my life I never saw anything like that fox standing there with her pale golden eyes on me and this great black fur being blown by the wind.\
 (paragraph 8) Suddenly her nose quivered. It was such a slight movement I almost didn't see it, and then her mouth opened and I could see the pink tip of her tongue. She turned. She still was not afraid, but with a bound that was lighter than the wind-it was as if she was being blown away over the field-she was gone.\
 (paragraph 9) Still I didn't move. I couldn't. I couldn't believe that I had really seen the fox.\
 (paragraph 10) I had seen foxes before in zoos, but I was always in such a great hurry to get on to the good stuff that I was saying stupid things like, \"I want to see the go-rilllllas\", and not once had I ever really looked at a fox. Still, I could never remember seeing a black fox, not even in a zoo.\
 (paragraph 11) Also, there was a great deal of difference between seeing an animal in the zoo in front of painted fake rocks and trees and seeing one natural and free in the woods. It was like seeing a kite on the floor and then, later, seeing one up in the sky where it was supposed to be, pulling at the wind.\
 (paragraph 12) I started to pick up my pencil and write as quickly as I could, \"P.S. Today I saw a black fox.\" But I didn't. This was the most exciting thing that had happened to me, and \"P.S. Today I saw a black fox\" made it nothing. \"So what else is happening?\" Petie Burkis would probably write back. I folded my letter, put it in an envelope, and sat there.\

 Ithaka (Ithaka - In the epic, The Odyssey, it took Odysseus 10 years to return to his Greek island home of Ithaka after\
 winning the Trojan war)\
 \
 As you set out for Ithaka\
 hope the voyage is a long one,\
 full of adventure, full of discovery.\
 Laistrygonians and Cyclops, (Laistrygonians and Cyclops - monsters that Odysseus encountered on his journey home)\
 (line 5) angry Poseidon (Poseidon - the Greek god of the sea who sought to punish Odysseus for harming his son, a Cyclops)—don’t be afraid of them:\
 you’ll never find things like that on your way\
 as long as you keep your thoughts raised high,\
 as long as a rare excitement\
 stirs your spirit and your body.\
 (line 10) Laistrygonians and Cyclops,\
 wild Poseidon—you won’t encounter them\
 unless you bring them along inside your soul,\
 unless your soul sets them up in front of you.\
 \
 Hope the voyage is a long one.\
 (line 15) May there be many a summer morning when,\
 with what pleasure, what joy,\
 you come into harbors seen for the first time;\
 may you stop at Phoenician trading stations\
 to buy fine things,\
 (line 20) mother of pearl and coral, amber and ebony,\
 sensual perfume of every kind—\
 as many sensual perfumes as you can;\
 and may you visit many Egyptian cities\
 to gather stores of knowledge from their scholars.\
 \
 (line 25) Keep Ithaka always in your mind.\
 Arriving there is what you are destined for.\
 But do not hurry the journey at all.\
 Better if it lasts for years,\
 so you are old by the time you reach the island,\
 (line 30) wealthy with all you have gained on the way,\
 not expecting Ithaka to make you rich.\
 \
 Ithaka gave you the marvelous journey.\
 Without her you would not have set out.\
 She has nothing left to give you now.\
 (line 35) And if you find her poor, Ithaka won’t have fooled you.\
 Wise as you will have become, so full of experience,\
 you will have understood by then what these Ithakas mean.\

 Reading Comprehension Passage A\
 \
 The Count and the Wedding Guest\
 \
    Miss Maggie Conway and Mr. Andy Donovan are staying at the same boarding house in New York City.\
 \
    …Just coming out the door was Miss Conway. She wore a night-black dress of\
 crêpe de—crêpe de—oh, this thin black goods.(goods - fabric) Her hat was black, and from it drooped and\
 fluttered an ebon veil, filmy as a spider’s web. She stood on the top step and drew on black\
 silk gloves. Not a speck of white or a spot of color about her dress anywhere. Her rich\
 (line 5) golden hair was drawn, with scarcely a ripple, into a shining, smooth knot low on her neck.\
 Her face was plain rather than pretty, but it was now illuminated and made almost beautiful\
 by her large gray eyes that gazed above the houses across the street into the sky with an\
 expression of the most appealing sadness and melancholy. …\
    “It’s a fine, clear evening, Miss Conway,” he [Andy Donovan] said; and if the Weather\
 (line 10) Bureau could have heard the confident emphasis of his tones it would have hoisted the\
 square white signal, (square white signal - a sign of good weather) and nailed it to the mast.\
    “To them that has the heart to enjoy it, it is, Mr. Donovan,” said Miss Conway, with\
 a sigh. …\
    “I hope none of your relatives—I hope you haven’t sustained a loss?” ventured\
 (line 15) Mr. Donovan.\
    “Death has claimed,” said Miss Conway, hesitating—“not a relative, but one who—but\
 I will not intrude my grief upon you, Mr. Donovan.”\
    “Intrude?” protested Mr. Donovan. “Why, say, Miss Conway, I’d be delighted, that is,\
 I’d be sorry—I mean I’m sure nobody could sympathize with you truer than I would.”\
 (line 20)   Miss Conway smiled a little smile. And oh, it was sadder than her expression in repose. (repose - at rest) …\
    “It’s tough to be alone in New York—that’s a cinch,” said Mr. Donovan. “But, say—\
 whenever this little old town does loosen up and get friendly it goes the limit. Say you took\
 a little stroll in the park, Miss Conway—don’t you think it might chase away some of your\
 mullygrubs? And if you’d allow me—”\
 (line 25)   “Thanks, Mr. Donovan. I’d be pleased to accept of your escort if you think the company\
 of one whose heart is filled with gloom could be anyways agreeable to you.”\
    Through the open gates of the iron-railed, old, downtown park, where the elect once\
 took the air, they strolled, and found a quiet bench. …\
    “He was my fiancé,” confided Miss Conway, at the end of an hour. “We were going to\
 (line 30) be married next spring. I don’t want you to think that I am stringing you, Mr. Donovan, but\
 he was a real Count. He had an estate and a castle in Italy. Count Fernando Mazzini was\
 his name. I never saw the beat of him for elegance. Papa objected, of course, and once \
 we eloped, but papa overtook us, and took us back. I thought sure papa and Fernando \
 would fight a duel. Papa has a livery business—in P’kipsee [Poughkeepsie], you know.” … \
 (line 35)    “Three days ago I got a letter from Italy, forwarded from P’kipsee, saying that Fernando \
 had been killed in a gondola accident.” … \
    “I’ve got his picture here in my locket,” said Miss Conway, after wiping her eyes with \
 her handkerchief. “I never showed it to anybody; but I will to you, Mr. Donovan, because \
 I believe you to be a true friend.” \
 (line 40)   Mr. Donovan gazed long and with much interest at the photograph in the locket that \
 Miss Conway opened for him. The face of Count Mazzini was one to command interest. \
 It was a smooth, intelligent, bright, almost a handsome face—the face of a strong, cheerful \
 man who might well be a leader among his fellows. \
    “I have a larger one, framed, in my room,” said Miss Conway. “When we return I will\
 (line 45) show you that. They are all I have to remind me of Fernando. But he ever will be present \
 in my heart, that’s a sure thing.” \
    A subtle task confronted Mr. Donovan,—that of supplanting (supplanting - replacing) the unfortunate Count in \
 the heart of Miss Conway. This his admiration for her determined him to do. But the \
 magnitude of the undertaking did not seem to weigh upon his spirits. The sympathetic but\
 (line 50) cheerful friend was the role he essayed; (essayed - attempted) and he played it so successfully that the next \
 half-hour found them conversing pensively across two plates of ice-cream, though yet there \
 was no diminution of the sadness in Miss Conway’s large gray eyes. \
    Before they parted in the hall that evening she ran upstairs and brought down the \
 framed photograph wrapped lovingly in a white silk scarf. Mr. Donovan surveyed it with\
 (line 55) inscrutable (inscrutable - unreadable) eyes. … \
    “A fine-looking man,” said Mr. Donovan, heartily. “How would it suit you, Miss Conway, \
 to give me the pleasure of your company to Coney [Island] next Sunday afternoon?” \
    A month later they announced their engagement to Mrs. Scott and the other boarders. \
 Miss Conway continued to wear black.\
 (line 60)   A week after the announcement the two sat on the same bench in the downtown park, \
 while the fluttering leaves of the trees made a dim kinetoscopic (kinetoscopic - flickering) picture of them in the \
 moonlight. But Donovan had worn a look of abstracted gloom all day. He was so silent \
 to-night that love’s lips could not keep back any longer the questions that love’s heart \
 propounded. (propounded - put forward)\
 (line 65)   “What’s the matter, Andy, you are so solemn and grouchy to-night?”\
    “Nothing, Maggie.”\
    “I know better. Can’t I tell? You never acted this way before. What is it?” … \
    “I’ll tell you then,” said Andy, wisely, “but I guess you won’t understand it exactly. \
 You’ve heard of Mike Sullivan, haven’t you? ‘Big Mike’ Sullivan, everybody calls him.”\
 (line 70)   “No, I haven’t,” said Maggie. “And I don’t want to, if he makes you act like this. Who is \
 he?” …\
    “Well, Big Mike’s a friend of mine. I ain’t more than deuce-high in the district as far as \
 influence goes, but Mike’s as good a friend to a little man, or a poor man as he is to a big \
 one. I met him to-day on the Bowery [Street], and what do you think he does? Comes up\
 (line 75) and shakes hands. ‘Andy,’ says he, ‘I’ve been keeping cases on you. You’ve been putting in \
 some good licks over on your side of the street, and I’m proud of you. What’ll you take to \
 drink?’ He takes a cigar, and I take a highball. I told him I was going to get married in two \
 weeks. ‘Andy,’ says he, ‘send me an invitation, so I’ll keep in mind of it, and I’ll come to the \
 wedding.’ That’s what Big Mike says to me; and he always does what he says. \
 (line 80)   “You don’t understand it, Maggie, but I’d have one of my hands cut off to have Big Mike \
 Sullivan at our wedding. It would be the proudest day of my life. When he goes to a man’s \
 wedding, there’s a guy being married that’s made for life. Now, that’s why I’m maybe looking \
 sore to-night.”\
    “Why don’t you invite him, then, if he’s so much to the mustard?” (to the mustard - successful) said Maggie, lightly. …\
 (line 85)   “Maggie,” said Andy, presently, “do you think as much of me as you did of your—as you \
 did of the Count Mazzini?”\
    He waited a long time, but Maggie did not reply. And then, suddenly she leaned against \
 his shoulder and began to cry—to cry and shake with sobs, holding his arm tightly, and \
 wetting the crêpe de Chine with tears. …\
 (line 90)   But instead of being pushed away, she found Andy’s arm folding her closer. She looked \
 up and saw his face cleared and smiling. …\
    “Andy,” said Maggie, with a somewhat shy smile, after she had been thoroughly assured \
 of forgiveness, “did you believe all that story about the Count?” \
    “Well, not to any large extent,” said Andy, reaching for his cigar case, “because it’s\
 (line 95) Big Mike Sullivan’s picture you’ve got in that locket of yours.” \

In this excerpt, the author talks about introducing her chickens to her yard.\
 \
 Excerpt from Birdology\
 by Sy Montgomery\
 \
 At first I was afraid they’d run away or become lost. We had a cozy, secure home for\
 them prepared in the bottom storey of our barn, with wood shavings scattered over the\
 dirt floor, a dispenser for fresh water, a trough for chick feed, some low perches made\
 from dowels, and a hay-lined nest box made from an old rabbit hutch left over from one\
 (line 5) of the barn’s previous denizens, in which they could lay future eggs. Chickens need to be\
 closed in safe at night to protect them from predators, but by day we didn’t want to\
 confine them; we wanted to give them free run of the yard. But how could they possibly\
 understand that they lived here now? Once we let them out, would they even recognize\
 their space in the barn and go back in it? When I was in seventh grade, my family had\
 (line 10) moved, once again, to a new house; my first afternoon there I literally got lost in my own\
 backyard. Could these six-week-old chicks be expected to know better?\
 Gretchen assured me there would be no problem. “Leave them in the pen for\
 twenty-four hours,” she told me. “Then you can let them out and they’ll stick around.\
 They’ll go back in again when it starts to get dark.”\
 (line 15) “But how do they know?” I asked.\
 “They just do,” she said. “Chickens just know these things.”\
 When before dusk, I found them all perched calmly back in their coop, I saw that\
 Gretchen was right.\
 In fact, chickens know many things, some from the moment they are born. Like all\
 (line 20) members of the order in which they are classified, the Galliformes, or game birds,\
 just-hatched baby chickens are astonishingly mature and mobile, able to walk, peck, and\
 run only hours after leaving the egg.\
 This developmental strategy is called precocial. Like its opposite, the altricial strategy\
 (employed by creatures such as humans and songbirds, who are born naked and helpless),\
 (line 25) the precocial strategy was sculpted by eons of adaptation to food and predators. If your\
 nest is on the ground, as most game birds’ are, it’s a good idea to get your babies out of\
 there as quickly as possible before someone comes to eat them. So newborn game birds\
 hatch covered in down, eyes open, and leave the nest within twenty-four hours. (An\
 Australian game bird known as the malleefowl begins its life by digging its way out of\
 (line 30) its nest of decaying vegetation and walks off into the bush without ever even meeting\
 either parent.)\
 That chickens hatch from the egg knowing how to walk, run, peck, and scratch has an\
 odd consequence: many people take this as further evidence they are stupid. But instinct is\
 not stupidity. (After all, Einstein was born knowing how to suckle.) Nor does instinct\
 (line 35) preclude learning. Unlike my disoriented seventh-grade self (and I have not improved\
 much since), young chickens have a great capacity for spatial learning. In scientific\
 experiments, researchers have trained days-old chicks to find hidden food using both\
 distant and nearby landmarks as cues. Italian researchers demonstrated that at the tender\
 age of fifteen days, after just a week’s training to find hidden food in the middle of their\
 (line 40) cage, chicks can correctly calculate the center of a given environment—even in the\
 absence of distinctive landmarks. Even more astonishing, they can do it in spaces they\
 have never seen before, whether the area be circular, square, or triangular. How? The\
 chicks “probably relied on a visual estimate of these distances from their actual positions,”\
 wrote University of Padova researcher L. Tommasi and co-authors in the Journal of\
 (line 45) Comparative Physiology, ”. . . [but] it remains to be determined how the chicks actually\
 measure distances in the task.”\
 We never determined how our first chickens knew their new home was theirs, either.\
 We never knew how they managed to discern the boundaries of our property. But they\
 did. At first, they liked to stay near the coop. But as they grew, they took to following me\
 (line 50) everywhere, first cheeping like the tinkling of little bells, later clucking in animated adult\
 discussion. If I was hanging out the laundry, they would check what was in the laundry\
 basket. If I was weeding a flower bed, they would join me, raking the soil with their\
 strong, scaly feet, then stepping backward to see what was revealed. (Whenever I worked\
 with soil, I suspect they assumed I was digging for worms.) When my husband, Howard,\
 (line 55) and I would eat at the picnic table under the big silver maple, the Ladies would\
 accompany us. When my father-in-law came to help my husband build a pen for\
 Christopher Hogwood, then still a piglet, the Ladies milled underfoot to supervise every\
 move. The hens were clearly interested in the project, pecking at the shiny nails, standing\
 tall to better observe the use of tools, clucking a running commentary all the while. Before\
 (line 60) this experience, Howard’s dad would have been the first to say that he didn’t think\
 chickens were that smart. But they changed his mind. After a few hours I noticed he\
 began to address them. Picking up a hammer they were examining, he might say, directly\
 and respectfully, “Pardon me, Ladies”—as if he were speaking to my mother-in-law and\
 me when we got in the way.\
 (line 65) But when their human friends are inside, and this is much of the time, the Ladies\
 explore on their own. A chicken can move as fast as nine miles an hour, which can take\
 you pretty far, and ours are free to go anywhere they like. But ours have intuited our\
 property lines and confine their travels to its boundaries. They have never crossed the\
 street. And for years, they never hopped across the low stone wall separating our land\
 (line 70) from that of our closest neighbor. That came later—and it was not the result of any\
 physical change in the landscape, but the outcome of a change in social relationships\
 among their human friends.\
Which claim do lines 65 through 72 support?\
(A) The chickens stay where they do as a direct result of what the author has taught them.\
 (B) The chickens do what they do because of their interactions with their environment.\
 (C) The chickens stay where they do because they are unfamiliar with other areas.\
 (D) The chickens do what they do as a result of trial and error.\

Interactions Between the United States of America and the Soviet Union\
 1948–49 | 1962 | 1979\
 In June 1948, the Soviet Union blockades democratic West Berlin. The U.S. and its allies fly in supplies daily to keep the city from starving.

. . . History shows that wars are divided into two kinds, just and unjust. All wars that are progressive [reformist] are just, and all wars that impede [obstruct] progress are unjust. We Communists oppose all unjust wars that impede progress, but we do not oppose progressive, just wars. Not only do we Communists not oppose just wars, we actively participate in them. As for unjust wars, World War I is an instance in which both sides fought for imperialist interests; therefore the Communists of the whole world firmly opposed that war. The way to oppose a war of this kind is to do everything possible to prevent it before it breaks out and, once it breaks out, to oppose war with war, to oppose unjust war with just war, whenever possible. . . .\
 \
 — Mao Zedong, Quotations from Chairman Mao Tse-Tung, Foreign Languages Press, Peking, 1966\
Based on this passage, what does Mao believe about World War I?\
(1) The philosophical beliefs of the competing countries challenged traditional ideals.\
 (2) The potential political gains of European nations benefited China.\
 (3) The countries in the war were involved for their individual economic benefits.\
 (4) The possible military losses made it too risky for the Communist Party to intervene.\

 \
 Sir: If you were to offer a Nation of the Year award, my vote would go to Israel. For the past 19 years, this bastion [stronghold] of democracy has survived in spite of the Arab commandment “harass thy neighbor.” This tiny nation may yet fulfill the Biblical prophecy of being a “light unto all nations.” Let’s hope the U.A.R. [United Arab Republic] is one of the first to see the light. \

 \
 \
 Sir: TIME’S lavish contribution, in the form of a cover story, to the Israeli cause is exceeded only by the distorted, sketchy coverage afforded the plight of the Arabs. Neither eloquent oratory [moving speeches] nor military victories can decide the rights of people. Win or lose, the underlying principle for the Arab struggle is no less justified. Where was indignant [angry] world opinion in 1947 when “third parties” paid off political debts with land that they did not own? Where were those who now call for justice when these parties permitted the Arab to be ejected from land he has owned for generations? Perhaps only history will vindicate [justify] the Arab cause, but what of today?\

 Excerpt from Snowflake Bentley\
 by Jacqueline Briggs Martin\
 \
 (paragraph 1) In the days when farmers worked with ox and sled and cut the dark with lantern light, there lived a boy who loved snow more than anything in the world. Willie Bentley’s happiest days were snowstorm days. He watched snowflakes on his mittens, on the dried grass of Vermont farm fields, on the dark metal handle of the barn door. He said snow was as beautiful as butterflies, or apple blossoms.\
 \
 (paragraph 2) He could net butterflies and show them to his older brother, Charlie. He could pick apple blossoms and take them to his mother. But he could not share snowflakes because he could not save them.\
 \
 (paragraph 3) When his mother gave him an old microscope, he used it to look at flowers, raindrops, and blades of grass. Best of all, he used it to look at snow. While other children built forts and pelted snowballs at roosting crows, Willie was catching snowflakes. Day after stormy day he studied the icy crystals.\
 \
 (paragraph 4) Their intricate patterns were even more beautiful than he had imagined. He expected to find whole flakes that were the same, that were copies of each other. But he never did. Willie decided he must find a way to save snowflakes so others could see their wonderful designs. For three winters he tried drawing snow crystals. They always melted before he could finish.\
 \
 (paragraph 5) When he was sixteen, Willie read of a camera with its own microscope. “If I had that camera I could photograph snowflakes,” he told his mother. Willie’s mother knew that he would not be happy until he could share what he had seen.\
 \
 (paragraph6) “Fussing with snow is just foolishness,” his father said. Still, he loved his son. When Willie was seventeen his parents spent their savings and bought the camera. It was taller than a newborn calf, and cost as much as his father’s herd of ten cows. Willie was sure it was the best of all cameras.\
 \
 (paragraph 7) Even so his first pictures were failures—no better than shadows. Yet he would not quit. Mistake by mistake, snowflake by snowflake, Willie worked through every storm. Winter ended, the snow melted, and he had no good pictures. He waited for another season of snow. One day, in the second winter, he tried a new experiment. And it\
 worked! Willie had figured out how to photograph snowflakes! “Now everyone can see the great beauty in a tiny crystal,” he said.\
 \
 (paragraph 8) But in those days, no one cared. Neighbors laughed at the idea of photographing snow. “Snow in Vermont is as common as dirt,” they said. “We don’t need pictures.” Willie said the photographs would be his gift to the world. While other farmers sat by the fire or rode to town with horse and sleigh, Willie studied snowstorms. He stood at the shed door and held out a black tray to catch the flakes.\
 \
 (paragraph 9) When he found only jumbled, broken crystals, he brushed the tray clean with a turkey feather and held it out again. He waited hours for just the right crystal and didn’t notice the cold. If the shed were warm the snow would melt. If he breathed on the black tray the snow would melt. If he twitched a muscle as he held the snow crystal on the long wood pick the snowflake would break. He had to work fast or the snowflake would evaporate before he could slide it into place and take its picture. Some winters he was able to make only a few dozen good pictures. Some winters he made hundreds. . . .\
 \
 (paragraph 10) But his snow crystal pictures were always his favorites. He gave copies away or sold them for a few cents. He made special pictures as gifts for birthdays. He held evening slide shows on the lawns of his friends. Children and adults sat on the grass and watched while Willie projected his slides onto a sheet hung over a clothesline.\
 \
 (paragraph 11) He wrote about snow and published his pictures in magazines. He gave speeches about snow to faraway scholars and neighborhood skywatchers. “You are doing great work,” said a professor from Wisconsin. The little farmer came to be known as the world’s expert on snow, “the Snowflake Man.” But he never grew rich. He spent every\
 penny on his pictures. Willie said there were treasures in snow. “I can’t afford to miss a single snowstorm,” he told a friend. “I never know when I will find some wonderful prize.”\

“. . . The removal of Cherokee Indians from their life long homes in the year of 1838 found me a young man in the prime of life and a Private soldier in the American Army. Being acquainted with many of the Indians and able to fluently speak their language, I was sent as interpreter into the Smoky Mountain Country in May, 1838, and witnessed the execution of the most brutal order in the History of American Warfare. I saw the helpless Cherokees arrested and dragged from their homes, and driven at the bayonet point into the stockades. And in the chill of a drizzling rain on an October morning I saw them loaded like cattle or sheep into six hundred and forty five wagons and started toward the west. . . .”\

The quotations below are from Denys, a British officer serving in the British Indian Army in 1947, who was interviewed as part of the “Partition Voices” project.\
 \
 “We were fairly thin on the ground by August 1947. On Independence Day I was in Lahore making my way back to England. I remember people shaking my hand saying, ‘Thank you. Thank you for making us independent.’\
 \
 “The station was knee-deep in bodies. It was a terrible time. Trains coming from one direction full of dead Sikhs and Hindus – and trains coming from the other full of dead Muslims.\
 \
 “We all – sort of people like myself, British officers – felt Partition went through too fast. The whole thing was not thought through.\
 \
 “I think the British government of the day was anxious to get it done quickly. It was a great mistake.” \
 \
 Source: “A Country Divided: How it affected me,” BBC News online\
Which statement best supports the conclusion that Denys is a reliable source of evidence regarding the partition of India?\
(1) He provides examples of the hostility individual Indians showed toward British soldiers.\
 (2) He includes details that support the British government’s position regarding the division of British India.\
 (3) He reports that India requested the continued help of the British military.\
 (4) He gives an eyewitness account describing what he saw on Independence Day.\

In the 1660s, Flemish physician Jan van Helmont grew a small willow tree in a pot of soil. He added only water to the pot. At the end of five years, he found that the tree had gained 75 kilograms, but there was very little change in the mass of the soil. Van Helmont concluded that the plant gained weight directly from the water. We now know that this conclusion is only partially correct because, in addition to water, photosynthesis also requires\
(1) oxygen from the atmosphere\
 (2) carbon dioxide from the atmosphere\
 (3) proteins from animal prey\
 (4) carbohydrates from the soil\

Excerpt from Wheels of Change: How Women Rode the Bicycle to Freedom (With a Few Flat Tires Along the Way)\
 by Sue Macy\
 \
 (paragraph 1) Women’s rights crusader Elizabeth Cady Stanton was in her eighties during the\
 heyday of the bicycle, and no evidence exists to show that she actually ever rode one.\
 But there was no better or more eloquent advocate for women and the wheel. In 1895,\
 Stanton contributed an article to the American Wheelman celebrating this “wonderful\
 new style of locomotion.” In the article, titled “The Era of the Bicycle,” she pointed out\
 that cycling was increasing people’s mobility, eliminating the cost of feeding and\
 housing horses, and encouraging the building of good roads. However, she saved her\
 greatest praise for the bicycle’s effects on women. “The bicycle,” she wrote, “will inspire\
 women with more courage, self-respect and self-reliance and make the next generation\
 more vigorous of mind and of body; for feeble mothers do not produce great\
 statesmen, scientists and scholars.”\
 (paragraph 2) For all the practical benefits of the two-wheeler, the fact is that it brought about a\
 cosmic shift in women’s private and public lives. With the rise of industry and the\
 move from a rural to an urban economy in the 19th century, American women had\
 become increasingly confined to their homes. Young girls could play outside, but when\
 they matured, their freedom of movement was greatly restricted. “At sixteen years of\
 age, I was enwrapped in the long skirts that impeded every footstep,” remembered\
 Frances Willard, who in 1895 wrote a best-selling account of how she learned to ride a\
 bicycle at age 53. “I have detested walking and felt with a certain noble disdain that the\
 conventions of life had cut me off from what . . . had been one of life’s sweetest joys.”\
 (paragraph 3) While wealthier women were saddled with long skirts and restrictive corsets, those\
 who were less well off worked anonymously in mills and factories. All in all, the result\
 was the same. Except in a few instances, the public image of America was male.\
 Politicians, soldiers, business leaders, and even the leading athletes in the new sports of\
 baseball and football were all men. But the bicycle changed that. Suddenly, women\
 were leaving their homes to cycle and socialize on country roads and city streets.\
 Bicycle racers such as Louise Armaindo and Frankie Nelson had their exploits splashed\
 all over the papers. Bicycle manufacturers, intent on mining an untapped market,\
 showed female models in their advertisements. Thanks to the wheel, women were\
 starting to be seen and heard in public life.\
 (paragraph 4) It was not a stretch for some cyclists to see the possibility of a larger role for women\
 in the world. When she conquered the wheel, Frances Willard was a former university\
 president and the longtime president of the Woman’s Christian Temperance Union,\
 which fought to prohibit the use of alcoholic beverages and to win women the right to\
 vote. Willard saw parallels between learning to ride and learning to live. “I began to feel\
 that myself plus the bicycle equaled myself plus the world, upon whose spinning wheel\
 we must all learn to ride,” she wrote. “He who succeeds, or, to be more exact in handing\
 over my experience, she who succeeds in gaining the mastery of [a bicycle], will gain\
 the mastery of life.”\
 (paragraph 5) For decades, Willard, along with Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Susan B. Anthony, and\
 many others, had been working toward increased political and economic rights for\
 women. Now the bicycle brought a taste of independence to women on a very personal\
 level, and some of them took the opportunity to express their discontent with old\
 traditions and expectations. In August 1895, a cyclist named Ann Strong caused a stir\
 when she compared the value of a bicycle to that of a husband in the Minneapolis\
 Tribune. “I can’t see but that a wheel is just as good company as most husbands,” she\
 declared. “I would as lief (lief: happily) talk to one inanimate object as another; and I’d a great deal\
 rather talk to one that can’t answer than one that won’t.” Strong then contrasted the joy\
 of cycling with the challenges of raising a family. “You can make your wheel tidy over\
 night,” she said, “and it never kicks off its shoes the very last minute, and never smears\
 itself with molasses. When you are ready you can start. No little elbows are stuck in\
 your ribs; there is no wiggling; screams at the cars or at the candy stores. You glide\
 along, silently, smoothly, swiftly.”\
 (paragraph 6) Some stated the liberating effects of the bicycle with less sarcasm. “The bicycle has\
 brought to women a healthful, wholesome means of securing a degree of freedom and\
 independence that no amount of discussion regarding ‘women’s rights’ would ever\
 have produced,” wrote the L.A.W. Bulletin and Good Roads magazine in 1898.\
 Meanwhile, Munsey’s Magazine assessed the impact of the wheel on women in a\
 special bicycle-themed issue. “If she has ridden her bicycle into new fields, becoming in\
 the process a new creature, it has been gradually and unconsciously,” the editors wrote.\
 (paragraph 7) “She did not have to be born again in some mysterious fashion, becoming a strange\
 creature, a ‘new woman.’ She is more like the ‘eternal feminine,’ who has taken on\
 wings, and who is using them with an ever increasing delight in her new power.”\
 Indeed, many bicycle companies at home and abroad did put wings on the women in\
 their advertisements, emphasizing that they had taken flight.\
 (paragraph 8) Not all publications treated the emergence of the “new woman” with the same level\
 of approval. Some mocked her, while others just seemed baffled by her. Her new way of\
 dressing, in bloomers or divided skirts or skirts with shortened hems, certainly\
 disturbed the old social order, but so did her confidence and daring. These traits led\
 commentators to worry that the differences between the sexes were being blurred, a\
 fear that was reinforced as the four newest states—Wyoming, Colorado, Utah, and\
 Idaho—granted women the right to vote in the 1890s. Would the bicycle help bring\
 about a new kind of equality between men and women? Elizabeth Cady Stanton and\
 her colleagues certainly hoped so. At any rate, the image of a female cyclist quickly\
 became associated with efforts to win more rights for women.\
What idea about women riding bicycles is emphasized in paragraphs 6 and 7?\
(A) Riding bicycles offered more than just freedom of movement.\
 (B) Riding bicycles was a simple way to participate in a political movement.\
 (C) Riding bicycles changed women’s fashion.\
 (D) Riding bicycles was a popular subject in magazines.\

Reading Comprehension Passage C\
 Many Animals Can Count, Some Better Than You\
 \
 Every night during breeding season, the male túngara frog of Central America will stake\
 out a performance patch in the local pond and spend unbroken hours broadcasting\
 his splendor to the world.\
 The mud-brown frog is barely the size of a shelled pecan, but his call is large and\
 (line 5) dynamic, a long downward sweep that sounds remarkably like a phaser weapon on\
 \"Star Trek,\" followed by a brief, twangy, harmonically dense chuck.(chuck - a clucking sound)\
 Unless, that is, a competing male starts calling nearby, in which case the first frog is\
 likely to add two chucks to the tail of his sweep. And should his rival respond likewise,\
 Male A will tack on three chucks.\
 (line 10) Back and forth they go, call and raise, until the frogs hit their respiratory limit at six\
 to seven rapid-fire chucks.\
 The acoustic one-upfrogship is energetically draining and risks attracting predators like\
 bats. Yet the male frogs have no choice but to keep count of the competition, for the simple\
 reason that female túngaras are doing the same: listening, counting and ultimately mating\
 (line 15) with the male of maximum chucks.\
 Behind the frog’s surprisingly sophisticated number sense, scientists have found, are\
 specialized cells in the amphibian midbrain that tally up sound signals and the intervals\
 between them.\
 \"The neurons are counting the number of appropriate pulses, and they’re highly\
 (line 20) selective,\" said Gary Rose, a biologist at the University of Utah. If the timing between\
 pulses is off by just a fraction of a second, the neurons don’t fire and the counting process\
 breaks down. …\
 Scientists have found that animals across the evolutionary spectrum have a keen sense\
 of quantity, able to distinguish not just bigger from smaller or more from less, but two from\
 (line 25) four, four from ten, forty from sixty.\
 Orb-weaving spiders, for example, keep a tally of how many silk-wrapped prey items are\
 stashed in the \"larder\" segment of their web. When scientists experimentally remove the\
 cache, the spiders will spend time searching for the stolen goods in proportion to how many\
 separate items had been taken, rather than how big the total prey mass might have been.\
 (line 30) Small fish benefit from living in schools, and the more numerous the group, the\
 statistically better a fish’s odds of escaping predation. As a result, many shoaling (shoaling - shallow water) fish are\
 excellent appraisers of relative head counts.\
 Guppies, for example, have a so-called contrast ratio of .8, which means they can\
 distinguish at a glance between four guppies and five, or eight guppies and ten, and if given\
 (line 35) the chance will swim toward the slightly fishier crowd.\
 Three-spined sticklebacks (sticklebacks - carnivorous fish) are more discriminating still: with a contrast ratio of .86,\
 they’re able to tell six fellow fish from seven, or 18 from 21 — a comparative power that\
 many birds, mammals and even humans might find hard to beat.\
 Despite the prevalence of math phobia, people too are born with a strong innate\
 (line 40) number sense, and numerosity is deeply embedded in many aspects of our minds and\
 culture.\
 Researchers have determined that number words for small quantities — less than five —\
 are strikingly similar across virtually every language studied, and the words are among the\
 most stable, unchanging utterances in any lexicon. (lexicon - language)\
 (line 45) They are more conserved through time and across cultures than words for other\
 presumably bedrock concepts like mother, father and most body parts, with a few puzzling\
 exceptions like the words for tongue and eye.\
 \"The sounds that you and I use to say ‘two’ or ‘three’ are the sounds that have been used\
 for tens of thousands of years,\" said Mark Pagel, a biologist who studies the evolution of\
 (line 50) language at the University of Reading.\
 \"It’s not out of the question that you could have been wandering around 15,000 years\
 ago and encountered a few of the last remaining Neanderthals, pointed to yourself and said,\
 ‘one,’ and pointed to them and said, ‘three,’ and those words, in an odd, coarse way, would\
 have been understood.\"\
 (line 55) That continuity, Dr. Pagel added, \"should astonish us.\" …\
 Attitudes about animal numerosity have changed dramatically since the mid-twentieth\
 century when many researchers believed only humans had enough gray matter to think\
 quantitatively. They cited as an object lesson the 1907 case of Clever Hans, the horse that\
 supposedly could solve arithmetic problems and would tap out his answers by hoof; as it\
 (line 60) turned out, he was responding to unconscious cues from the people around him.\
 Since then, researchers have approached the field with caution and rigor, seeking to\
 identify the specific evolutionary pressures that might spur the need for numeric judgments\
 in any given species.\
 Social carnivores like spotted hyenas, for example, live in fission-fusion societies, (fission-fusion societies - animals whose social group composition and size change as they move throughout their environment)\
 (line 65) collectively defending their territories against rivals but in ever-shifting groups of widely\
 roaming members. \"You can never predict who you’ll find in which group,\" said Sarah\
 Benson-Amram, an assistant professor of zoology and physiology at the University of\
 Wyoming. \"You might be alone or in a group of ten.\"\
 Because hyena jaws can pulverize zebra bones, encounters between [rival hyena]\
 (line 70) competitors can prove deadly; every spotted hyena must have a good sense from moment\
 to moment of how many there are of us versus how many of them. Dr. Benson-Amram and\
 her colleagues tested hyena numerosity skills in the field, playing back the recorded whoops\
 of spotted hyenas living in South Africa and Namibia to hyenas in Kenya.\
 The Kenyan carnivores reacted to the whoops of strangers as predicted, approaching\
 (line 75)\
 the hidden source of the sound when they had a home team advantage, retreating when\
 they heard a few too many distinctive voices in a row. Or sometimes, when the local hyenas\
 were outnumbered, they’d call for backup. …\
 Chimpanzees are social scorekeepers, episodic (episodic - periodic) warriors and number ninjas, too.\
 They can be taught to associate groups of objects with corresponding Arabic numerals up\
 (line 80) to the number 9 and sometimes beyond — three squares on a computer screen with the\
 number 3, five squares with 5, and so on. They can put those numerals in order.\
 The numeric working memory of young chimpanzees is astonishing: Flash a random\
 scattering of numerals on a screen for just 210 milliseconds — half an eye blink — and then\
 cover the numbers with white squares, and a numerically schooled young chimpanzee will\
 (line 85) touch the squares sequentially to indicate the ascending order of the numbers hidden\
 beneath.\
 Don’t bother trying to do this yourself, Tetsuro Matsuzawa, a primatologist at Kyoto\
 University, said at the scientific meeting in London on which the themed journal (the themed journal - a publication where animal numerosity studies were discussed) was based.\
 \"You can’t.\" …\
 (line 90) Stanislas Dehaene, a psychologist at the University of Paris, and his colleagues\
 presented evidence from brain scans of professional mathematicians that the neural\
 circuitry (neural circuitry - nerve cells) for advanced mathematical thinking is an elaboration on the archaic (archaic - primitive) number sense\
 we share with other animals. …\
 We hear that the price of something rose by 50 percent and then fell by 50 percent, and\
 (line 95) we reflexively, mistakenly conclude, \"Oh good, we’re back to where we started.\" Our natural\
 number sense adds and subtracts whole numbers, whole chucks, guppies and hyenas.\
 But it really abhors a fraction, and so has led us astray.\

Prey selection in a species of California garter snake depends upon where the snake lives. Snakes living inland feed on frogs, leeches, and fish while coastal snakes have added banana slugs to their diet. Banana slugs are found only in coastal areas. Researchers performed an experiment to determine what prey newly born snakes preferred. The table below summarizes the findings.\
 \
 Prey Preference in Newborn Garter Snakes\
  | Newborn Coastal Snakes | Newborn Inland Snakes\
 Percentage of Snakes Eating Banana Slugs | 60% | 20%\
 \
 Which inference best explains these differences?\
(1) The coastal snakes have been selectively bred for slug-eating behavior.\
 (2) Genetic manipulation has enabled the coastal snakes to recognize slugs as prey.\
 (3) The coastal snakes evolved a new organ so that they could recognize and feed on slugs.\
 (4) An adaptation enabled coastal snakes to use slugs as food source.\

The Mississippi River Delta wetlands ecosystem is home to a large number of fish, birds, and other aquatic organisms. During the last century, this ecosystem has seen a decrease in wetland areas and species diversity due to land development, agriculture, and flooding. Conservation groups have been working to reconnect the Mississippi River with its flood plain and restore lost wetlands. One result of restoring wetland areas in this ecosystem would be\
(1) an increase in abiotic factors that would cause organisms to develop new adaptations\
 (2) the development of an ecosystem that will prevent invasive species from settling there\
 (3) an increase in the carrying capacity of the ecosystem for wetland organisms\
 (4) to prevent the organisms that live in this ecosystem from competing for food and shelter\

 Mrs. Majeska and the Lost Gloves\
 \
 by Ethel Pochocki\
 \
 (paragraph 1) One crisp fall morning, Mrs. Majeska woke up with a craving for sauerkraut. It was so strong, she could smell it, she could taste it, and she knew she must have it for supper. So she put on her walking shoes, picked up her tub with a lid and a handle, and went into town to buy some.\
 \
 sauerkraut = chopped, pickled cabbage\
 \
  (paragraph 2) She walked briskly, enjoying the wind messing up her hair and the parade of dried leaves dancing ahead of her. It was a glorious day, and the thought of sauerkraut for supper, with a bit of apple and onion and sausage, made her want to dance along with the leaves.\
 \
 (paragraph 3) But suddenly she stopped. In the road there was a glove, a small black glove, the ﬁngers still plump, as if it had just left its owner’s hand. It was out of place in the middle of the road.\
 \
 (paragraph 4) Poor thing, thought Mrs. Majeska. I cannot leave it there. She picked it up quickly— a logging truck was coming—and laid it on the grass. She felt sorry for its owner, who now had only one glove. What good was one glove?\
 \
 (paragraph 5) On the way home from the store, she walked on the other side of the road, the sauerkraut sloshing inside the tub. A cluster of children came toward her, laughing and shouting to one another as they took turns kicking something in the dust. Finally they tired of it and ran off past Mrs. Majeska.\
 \
 (paragraph 6) She looked down at the sorry thing they had been kicking. It was another black glove, of the same size and shape as the one she had rescued. She examined it—yes, it was the mate to the other!\
 \
 (paragraph 7) Mrs. Majeska hesitated, then continued walking. It was only a glove, after all, not a child or a kitten or a wallet. Suddenly she stopped, turned around, and walked back to the crumpled bit of cloth. She picked it up, shook it out, and brushed off the dirt. It looked almost as good as new.\
 \
 (paragraph 8) With the glove in one hand and the tub of sauerkraut in the other, she strode down the road to where the other glove still lay in the grass. She placed its mate beside it, satisﬁed that they were now together. For what good was one glove without the other?\
 \
 (paragraph 9) A boy whizzed by on a bike and looked at her. Two old ladies, arm in arm, marched toward her on their way to the post ofﬁce. Mrs. Maj eska bent down and pretended to tie her Shoelaces, for she felt foolish to be caught in the act of reuniting a pair of gloves.\
 \
 (paragraph 10) That night, after a supper as delicious as she had imagined it, Mrs. Majeska sat in her rocker and thought about the gloves. She wished she had brought them home to use for herself. Their owner had probably already given them up for lost. The next morning,\
 after she had her coffee and read the newspaper, she decided to go back and get the gloves. But they were gone.\
 \
 (paragraph 11) Mrs. Majeska was mystiﬁed. Who—beside herself—would want a pair of gloves lying by the side of the road? Perhaps the owner had retraced her steps and rejoiced in ﬁnding them? Or maybe a housewife on a cleaning binge had used them to polish the stove? Or maybe a puppy needed something to chew on? Or a squirrel, to line its nest for winter?\
 \
 (paragraph 12) Mrs. Majeska would never know, but as long as she did not know, she would believe in a happy ending. No matter what their fate, the gloves were together, and that was all that mattered.\
How do paragraphs 3 and 4 foreshadow the ending of the story?\
(A) by emphasizing that a single glove is of little use\
 (B) by emphasizing that nobody cares about a lost glove\
 (C) by showing that Mrs. Majeska is careful when picking up the glove\
 (D) by showing that Mrs. Majeska is worried about the owner of the glove\

The First Public Park\
 by Marcia Amidon Lusted\
 \
 It was just an idea for more than a decade, but by 1857, New Yorkers were serious\
 about building a grand public park. New York was the largest metropolis in the nation,\
 and its citizens wanted to show the world that Americans were not just concerned about\
 industry, wealth, and materialism but that they also appreciated natural landscapes.\
 (line 5) Using eminent domain, the city took more than 840 acres of land in the center of\
 Manhattan for the new park. The area was considered to lack any real estate value—it\
 included swamps, bluffs, and rock outcroppings as well as two reservoirs that supplied city\
 water. It was home to about 1,600 poor residents, however. This population of pig farmers,\
 gardeners, and an African American settlement called Seneca Village was displaced by the\
 (line 10) park’s construction.\
 The Central Park Commission held a competition to choose someone to design the\
 park. Among the professional and amateur designers who entered the contest was a team\
 consisting of an American agriculturalist and a British-born architect: Frederick Law\
 Olmsted and Calvert Vaux.\
 (line 15) It was Vaux’s idea for the two men to join forces. A talented draftsman, Vaux used his\
 detailed drawings to show how their idea for the park would look. An accomplished\
 writer, Olmsted wrote the report that described their plan and included lists of proposed\
 plants and an estimated budget. They submitted their plan, called “Greensward,” a day\
 after the commission’s deadline.\
 (line 20) Greensward included pastoral views and rolling meadows, just like those in traditional\
 English parks. The plan offered beautiful vistas of green lawns and natural rocky ridges as\
 well as more formal locations for public gatherings.\
 It also included four roads that cut through the park to carry carriage traffic from one\
 side to the other. Olmsted and Vaux designed these major thoroughfares to run eight feet\
 (line 25) below the park’s surface so they would not disrupt the park’s views and rural feeling.\
 Pedestrian paths, equestrian roads, and carriage drives were all kept separate from one\
 another. Vaux designed more than 40 bridges so that these various paths would never have\
 to cross on the same level.\
 Unlike some of the other submissions that included grand, elaborate buildings,\
 (line 30) Olmsted and Vaux kept structures to a minimum, with only four in the original plan. The\
 design and materials for the buildings were also specifically selected to blend in with the\
 natural environment.\
 Greensward was announced the winner in the spring of 1858. The selection committee\
 debated over certain design points—some of the members wanted a wide grand avenue in\
 (line 35) the park, similar to those found in European parks. Olmsted argued against it by saying\
 that stately roads would “destroy scenery at great cost” and that “straight lines of trees or\
 stately architecture . . . belong not to parks for the people but to palatial gardens.” Olmsted\
 and Vaux had created their design for the recreation of all people, not just the wealthy.\
 The park was to be a place where all New Yorkers could enjoy nature. Its ultimate design\
 (line 40) would retain this feeling.\
 The construction of Central Park was one of the most massive public works projects\
 to take place in 19th-century New York. It required about 20,000 workers to reshape the\
 natural features of the land according to Olmsted and Vaux’s plan. Three hundred\
 thousand cubic yards of rock were blasted into rubble, and the resulting stone was crushed\
 (line 45) to use as paving material. Nearly three million cubic yards of soil were moved, and more\
 than 270,000 trees and shrubs were planted. Swamps were transformed into scenic lakes,\
 and extensive drainage work was done to get rid of small streams and pools. By 1866,\
 more than $5 million had been spent on construction. The park’s final price tag was more\
 than $10 million. In the end, this entirely planned park, stretching from 59th Street to\
 (line 50) 110th Street and from Fifth to Eighth avenues, had a completely natural, unplanned\
 feeling to it.\
 The process of overseeing the park’s construction and accounting for its expenditures\
 exhausted Olmsted. He required a six-week rest cure in Europe in 1859 and suffered a\
 severe broken leg in 1860 that laid him up, but he had the plans for the park spread out in\
 (line 55) his bedroom so he could continue to work. When he tried to resign from the project in\
 1861, however, the commission knew that it could not afford to lose him. Ultimately,\
 Olmsted’s duties and responsibilities were decreased, and when he departed the project to\
 serve in the U.S. Sanitary Commission during the Civil War (1861–1865), the park’s\
 construction was completed under park commission president Andrew Green and Vaux.\
 (line 60) Olmsted’s involvement in Central Park spanned nearly 20 years. It was not the only\
 site he worked or consulted on, and, for a couple of years, other projects demanded his\
 full attention. But from the time their plan was selected until the mid-1870s, Olmsted and\
 Vaux were associated with the park on and off. Sometimes, their titles as landscape\
 architect advisors required little on-site work. At other times, such as when Olmsted filled\
 (line 65) in as acting president of the Department of Public Parks, he looked into establishing lights\
 in the park at night and assessing the park’s safety. By 1878, however, Olmsted’s role with\
 the park officially ended.\
 Today, Central Park stands as one of Olmsted’s greatest legacies. It contains numerous\
 playgrounds and athletic fields. Runners and bicyclists make use of the wide, rolling paths.\
 (line 70) There are places to skate in the winter and boat in the summer. Concerts, plays, and rallies\
 take place there. Sculptures by famous artists can be found throughout the park. There are\
 also quiet places to walk, sit and read a book, or watch birds. Central Park has become a\
 world-famous site that attracts more than 25 million visitors each year. It also is a shining\
 example of Olmsted’s desire to create and preserve public green spaces in urban places for\
 (line 75) generations of people to enjoy.\
Which phrase from the article helps readers understand the meaning of “pastoral” (line 20)?\
(A) “grand public park” (line 2)\
 (B) “formal locations” (line 22)\
 (C) “rural feeling” (line 25)\
 (D) “world-famous site” (line 73)\

Measles: Eliminated?\
 Measles is a highly contagious viral disease. Infected people first experience a fever, cold-like symptoms, and a rash. Several complications can develop, such as ear infections, diarrhea, pneumonia, encephalitis (swelling of the brain), and death. Prior to the widespread use of the measles vaccine in the 1960s, it is estimated that 3–4 million people were infected every year. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention declared measles eliminated in the United States in 2000. This was accomplished, in part, due to a highly effective vaccination program. However, since 2016 the disease has made a comeback, and there has been an increase in measles cases in recent years.\
 \
 Number of Measles Cases\
 2010-2016\
 Year | Number of Cases\
 2010 | 63\
 2011 | 220\
 2012 | 55\
 2013 | 187\
 2014 | 667\
 2015 | 188\
 2016 | 70\
 Source: www.cdc.gov/measles/cases-outbreaks.html\
 \
 The reason for the dramatic decline in the number of measles cases from the 1960s to 2010 in the United States was because the vaccine\
(1) contained pathogens to fight against this highly contagious virus\
 (2) prevented the development of serious complications after infection\
 (3) exposed many people to a weakened form of the measles virus, making them immune\
 (4) contained an antibiotic that killed the measles virus, preventing its spread\

The Diving Horse\
 by John B. Abbott, Jr.\
 \
 Fall of 1959. That was the year Fidel Castro seized power in Cuba; Alaska and Hawaii\
 joined the Union as our 49th and 50th states, respectively; and Gunsmoke reigned as the\
 top TV series. Charlton Heston collected an Academy Award for Ben-Hur, and Leon Uris’s\
 Exodus topped the reading lists. In Garwood, New Jersey, a child picked up his favorite\
 (line 5) Golden Books (Golden Books were known as Little Golden Books, a popular series of children’s books that had gold-foil bindings.) and stood outside of his parents’ apartment building, waiting for the\
 school bus. What a sight: a chubby boy in black high-top Keds, jeans, and a flannel shirt,\
 patiently waiting and watching for the bus that, when it finally did rumble down Willow\
 Avenue, passed him by. The driver didn’t think to stop, which made perfect sense since\
 her route schedule didn’t include three-year-olds—not even three-year-old me.\
 (line 10) “The bus didn’t stop for me,” I complained to my mother that day.\
 “Oh, really?” she calmly replied. Later she would say that the only surprise was\
 the age at which I wanted to start going to school. But it shouldn’t have surprised her\
 really, because as the son of a pair of avid readers, I grew up in a house abundant with\
 opportunities to read and write. Newspapers, magazines, television, and radio were\
 (line 15) always available.\
 When I finally reached school age and the bus did stop, high drama and adventure\
 made up most of my extracurricular reading. I would read and reread Classics Illustrated\
 comics, and authors like Daniel Defoe, Mark Twain, Arthur Conan Doyle, Washington\
 Irving, Edgar Rice Burroughs, and Frank W. Dixon. I also enjoyed Superman and Batman\
 (line 20) comic books and even went through a MAD magazine phase. Sometimes Mom had to\
 chase me out of the house after school to play, because I would have rather just stayed in\
 my room and read.\
 I wasn’t much on writing until I was enrolled in a Catholic school, St. Bernard’s.\
 There, the nuns were stereotypically tough but thorough educators. In third grade, I\
 (line 25) labored long and hard with Sister Mary, and while it was her thoroughness that led to my\
 discovering that I loved to write, it was a horse—the Diving Horse of Atlantic City—that\
 sparked a lifetime passion for writing.\
 At the beginning of that school year, Sister Mary had assigned to us the ubiquitous\
 essay about summer vacation. That summer, my family had taken a day trip to the\
 (line 30) original Steel Pier in Atlantic City to see the famous Diving Horse. How my parents\
 learned of the horse, I don’t know, but as a family that took all its vacations by automobile,\
 no doubt they were alert for local-yet-unusual attractions. Atlantic City must have been\
 appealing; in the 1960s, there were no casinos or nightlife per se—unless you count Frank\
 Sinatra, Jr.—but the town was mostly known for its family-oriented amusements and the\
 (line 35) tradition of Bert Parks crooning his welcome to Miss America. But for us, Bert paled in\
 comparison to the Diving Horse. So off we went in the white ’64 Pontiac to climb aboard\
 carnival rides and eat hamburgers.\
 Thinking back on that day, I remember the windburn I got on my forearms from the\
 cool salty breeze off the Atlantic—a first for me. And to this day, I can’t go to the Jersey\
 (line 40) Shore without bringing home a box of fresh saltwater taffy.\
 But above all, I remember anxiously getting bleacher seats to see the Diving Horse. As\
 we took our seats, the horse, with a fellow named Arnette Webster (The author’s recollection of the diver appears to be inaccurate. Arnette French, a woman who performed in horse diving shows, stopped performing in 1935.) (clad in a rubber wet\
 suit) on its back, was about to jump from a platform roughly 30 feet high into a pool. I\
 recall staring at the odd sight of a horse standing as calmly as you please on a platform\
 (line 45) above a pool just like the kind I swam in at my Aunt Anne and Uncle Leo’s house. To a\
 recorded drumroll and cymbal crash, Webster urged the horse forward, and the two fell\
 through space to make the biggest splash I’d ever seen—even bigger than the cannonballs\
 my uncle could make in his own pool! Wow! And then both horse and rider surfaced,\
 though for the life of me, I can’t recall how they got out of the pool.\
 (line 50) So two months later, when Sister Mary gave us the essay assignment, it was easy . . . as\
 easy as falling into a pool.\
 Looking at the Diving Horse essay some 40 years later, it’s apparent how much I must\
 have enjoyed writing about the experience. I put a lot of energy into trying to describe the\
 windburn, the taffy, and the horse, which, to my eight-year-old eyes, must have been\
 (line 55) suitable for a Valkyrie to ride. But in that essay, I did something that I imagine no other\
 child in the class did: I ended my piece with a rhetorical question. I wrote, “How would\
 you like to go to Atlantic City?”\
 Small as that detail was, Sister Mary must have noticed it. And she must have\
 encouraged me to keep writing, because with that essay, I learned something about myself.\
 (line 60) I learned that I loved to write.\
 It was at that age, as my father has confirmed, that I started to write stories, not just\
 read them. I soon took to writing as I had taken to reading. I wrote about monsters,\
 superheroes, and what could pass for a fourth-grader’s version of a mystery. Superman\
 never had it so easy foiling the best-laid plans of Lex Luthor, and my detectives—not as\
 (line 65) articulate as Sherlock Holmes, but as savvy—somehow always managed to catch the bad\
 guys and still remember to say “Thank you.”\
 Even now, when many of my workdays at Rutgers University are done, Rex Stout,\
 Mark Twain, Arthur Conan Doyle, and Superman are still often at the center of my\
 recreational reading. And when I write a mystery, whatever thread each of my various\
 (line 70) detectives picks up and untangles, something inside reminds me of the chubby kid with\
 the glasses urging the horse to “Jump! Jump!”\
 In terms of distance, it was about 30 feet. In terms of writing, it was a leap of\
 a lifetime.\
Read lines 48 and 49.\
 Wow! And then both horse and rider surfaced, though for the life of me, I can’t recall how they got out of the pool.\

One of the effects of Hurricane Katrina, which devastated New Orleans in 2005, was the death of almost all of the plants in flooded areas. Initially, toxic chemicals and bacteria were suspected as a possible cause. Scientists later determined that the salt concentration in the floodwater caused the plants to die.\
 \
 The death of the plants was most likely due to\
(1) water moving into plant cells from the surrounding environment\
 (2) water moving out of plant cells into the surrounding environment\
 (3) both water and salt moving from plant cells into the surrounding environment\
 (4) both water and salt moving into plant cells from the surrounding environment\

 Excerpt from Gregor and the Sheep\
 by Toby Rosenstrauch\
 \
 (paragraph 1) In a valley in the highlands of Scotland, there once lived a young tenant farmer, Gregor, and his widowed mother. Although they worked hard, they could never accumulate enough money to buy the flock of sheep they longed to have, for their small parcel of land produced only modest amounts of oats and barley. To make matters\
 worse, MacTavish, the owner of this and many other crofts, always found reasons not to pay the farmers all they had earned. . . .\
 \
 crofts = small farms\
 \
 (paragraph 2) When he opened the door each morning and looked out, he saw MacTavish’s house on top of a mountain, a magnificent stone mansion surrounded by red, pink, and violet rhododendrons. Gregor often climbed the slope and stood outside the iron gates, wondering what fine furnishings and delicious foods lay within. Neighbors claimed\
 that MacTavish owned many houses and even kept a chest of gems under his bed. As Gregor, his mother, and their neighbors grew gaunt and pale with hard work and not enough food, they railed against MacTavish, who had swindled all of them at one time or another.\
 \
 swindled = cheated or tricked\
 \
 (paragraph 3) One day, as Gregor listened to the bagpipe music that drifted from the open windows of MacTavish’s mansion, he had an idea. That night, when his mother was asleep, he emptied the jug that held their money and counted it. After putting back a few coins for food, he put the rest in his pocket. The next morning, he hurried to the market, where he went from farmer to farmer, asking the prices of sheep for sale.\
 Gregor found many handsome animals, but they were all too expensive. When he reached a stall with scrawny and sickly sheep, the owner beckoned to him. . . .\
 \
 (paragraph 4) Gregor shook his head and began to walk away. The man grabbed his sleeve and whispered in his ear, “This one will make her owner rich!” Gregor examined the old sheep with spindly legs and dirty, unkempt wool—the worst of the lot. “If she will make me rich,” said Gregor, “how is it that she has not done so for you?”\
 \
 (paragraph 5) The man paused, thinking. “I have not had her long enough!”\
 \
 (paragraph 6) “Nonsense,” said Gregor, but he gave the man his money and led the pitiful animal home.\
 \
 (paragraph 7) When his mother saw what he had bought with their money, she burst into tears. “My foolish son, what have you done? Now we will starve, and no one will help us!”\
 \
 (paragraph 8) “Do as I say, Mother, and we will be rich. I promise.”\
 \
 (paragraph 9) She wanted to believe him. Wiping her eyes with her ragged sleeve, she asked what he wanted her to do.\
 \
 (paragraph 10) “Go to market and tell everyone that your son has a sheep that will make whoever owns her rich,” said Gregor. . . .\
 \
 (paragraph 11) One morning, a carriage arrived. Two servants opened the door and a stout, welldressed gentleman emerged. His Tartan kilt was made of the finest wool, his ascot was pure silk, and his shoes had silver buckles. On his fat fingers were eight gold rings, and his pomaded hair glistened in the sun. It was MacTavish!\
 \
 Tartan kilt = traditional clothing worn by Scottish Highlanders\
 \
 ascot = a type of necktie\
 \
 (paragraph 12) Gregor bowed as if to royalty. MacTavish looked at him sternly. “I have come to rid you of the unfortunate sheep that everyone is talking about,” said MacTavish, opening his sporran. “I can pay your price and I will have her, even though she has done nothing for you, I see.” MacTavish sneered at Gregor.\
 \
 sporran = a small bag worn at the waist for holding personal items\
 \
 (paragraph 13) Gregor hugged Dear One. “I will not sell her to you!”\
 \
 (paragraph 14) ”At that, MacTavish, whose servants were helping him into his carriage, turned and marched back. “I will pay anything,” he said. “Name the price.”\
 \
 (paragraph 15) Gregor was ready. “That,” he said, pointing up to the mansion above them. “I will have the dwelling and everything in it—furniture, utensils, even the chest of gems under your bed.”\
 \
 (paragraph 16) “Done,” said MacTavish.\
 \
 (paragraph 17) The next day, Gregor and his mother moved into the mansion that had once belonged to MacTavish, and MacTavish brought Dear One to the market so that all might see he could indeed own anything he wanted. Then MacTavish and the sheep rode away in his carriage to another of his houses in a valley beyond the mountains.\
 \
 (paragraph 18) After months had passed and the sheep had done nothing to increase MacTavish’s riches, he realized he had been swindled. Furious beyond speech, he returned to the mansion, but Gregor would not open the gates.\
 \
 (paragraph 19) “I have been cheated!” shouted MacTavish.\
 \
 (paragraph 20) “You have not been cheated,” said Gregor. “I was the owner of the sheep, and she has made me rich, hasn’t she?”\
 \
 (paragraph 21) “Yes, but . . . ,” sputtered MacTavish.\
 \
 (paragraph 22) “Then you got what you paid for.” Gregor turned and walked away.\
 \
 (paragraph 21) Soon afterward, Gregor sold the chest of gems and bought the huge flock of sheep he and his mother had always wanted. He shared the rest of his fortune with the other poor families of the valley who had been cheated by MacTavish.\

For a fortnight Gandhi’s march is intended to be only a demonstration. Then, when he expects to be at the sea, he will begin to produce salt from brine [salt water], and so infringe [violate] the Government salt monopoly, defying the Government to arrest and punish him. At the same time his supporters everywhere have been incited by him to refuse to pay local taxes.\

“. . . The removal of Cherokee Indians from their life long homes in the year of 1838 found me a young man in the prime of life and a Private soldier in the American Army. Being acquainted with many of the Indians and able to fluently speak their language, I was sent as interpreter into the Smoky Mountain Country in May, 1838, and witnessed the execution of the most brutal order in the History of American Warfare. I saw the helpless Cherokees arrested and dragged from their homes, and driven at the bayonet point into the stockades. And in the chill of a drizzling rain on an October morning I saw them loaded like cattle or sheep into six hundred and forty five wagons and started toward the west. . . .”\

 \
 French Colonization of Vietnam\
 \
 . . Economic development always involved what benefited France and her French colonists, not the Vietnamese. Vietnam was kept as dependent on the mother country as possible, both as a source of raw materials and as a captive market for French manufactured goods. Customs regulations were designed to promote French products and discourage competition from foreign goods, thus restricting the consumer in what he could buy.\
    A less shortsighted administration could have predicted the eventual outcome of these restrictive policies, but it took raw armed force to shock the French and the rest of the world into the realities of the situation. In a few words, the people were getting fed up. . .\

 Presidio Press, 1978 (adapted)\
What was a long-term effect of the situation described in this passage?\

Excerpt from Snowflake Bentley\
 by Jacqueline Briggs Martin\
 \
 (paragraph 1) In the days when farmers worked with ox and sled and cut the dark with lantern light, there lived a boy who loved snow more than anything in the world. Willie Bentley’s happiest days were snowstorm days. He watched snowflakes on his mittens, on the dried grass of Vermont farm fields, on the dark metal handle of the barn door. He said snow was as beautiful as butterflies, or apple blossoms.\
 \
 (paragraph 2) He could net butterflies and show them to his older brother, Charlie. He could pick apple blossoms and take them to his mother. But he could not share snowflakes because he could not save them.\
 \
 (paragraph 3) When his mother gave him an old microscope, he used it to look at flowers, raindrops, and blades of grass. Best of all, he used it to look at snow. While other children built forts and pelted snowballs at roosting crows, Willie was catching snowflakes. Day after stormy day he studied the icy crystals.\
 \
 (paragraph 4) Their intricate patterns were even more beautiful than he had imagined. He expected to find whole flakes that were the same, that were copies of each other. But he never did. Willie decided he must find a way to save snowflakes so others could see their wonderful designs. For three winters he tried drawing snow crystals. They always melted before he could finish.\
 \
 (paragraph 5) When he was sixteen, Willie read of a camera with its own microscope. “If I had that camera I could photograph snowflakes,” he told his mother. Willie’s mother knew that he would not be happy until he could share what he had seen.\
 \
 (paragraph6) “Fussing with snow is just foolishness,” his father said. Still, he loved his son. When Willie was seventeen his parents spent their savings and bought the camera. It was taller than a newborn calf, and cost as much as his father’s herd of ten cows. Willie was sure it was the best of all cameras.\
 \
 (paragraph 7) Even so his first pictures were failures—no better than shadows. Yet he would not quit. Mistake by mistake, snowflake by snowflake, Willie worked through every storm. Winter ended, the snow melted, and he had no good pictures. He waited for another season of snow. One day, in the second winter, he tried a new experiment. And it\
 worked! Willie had figured out how to photograph snowflakes! “Now everyone can see the great beauty in a tiny crystal,” he said.\
 \
 (paragraph 8) But in those days, no one cared. Neighbors laughed at the idea of photographing snow. “Snow in Vermont is as common as dirt,” they said. “We don’t need pictures.” Willie said the photographs would be his gift to the world. While other farmers sat by the fire or rode to town with horse and sleigh, Willie studied snowstorms. He stood at the shed door and held out a black tray to catch the flakes.\

 (paragraph 9) When he found only jumbled, broken crystals, he brushed the tray clean with a turkey feather and held it out again. He waited hours for just the right crystal and didn’t notice the cold. If the shed were warm the snow would melt. If he breathed on the black tray the snow would melt. If he twitched a muscle as he held the snow crystal on the long wood pick the snowflake would break. He had to work fast or the snowflake would evaporate before he could slide it into place and take its picture. Some winters he was able to make only a few dozen good pictures. Some winters he made hundreds. . . .\
 \
 (paragraph 10) But his snow crystal pictures were always his favorites. He gave copies away or sold them for a few cents. He made special pictures as gifts for birthdays. He held evening slide shows on the lawns of his friends. Children and adults sat on the grass and watched while Willie projected his slides onto a sheet hung over a clothesline.\
 \
 (paragraph 11) He wrote about snow and published his pictures in magazines. He gave speeches about snow to faraway scholars and neighborhood skywatchers. “You are doing great work,” said a professor from Wisconsin. The little farmer came to be known as the world’s expert on snow, “the Snowflake Man.” But he never grew rich. He spent every\
 penny on his pictures. Willie said there were treasures in snow. “I can’t afford to miss a single snowstorm,” he told a friend. “I never know when I will find some wonderful prize.”\
Which quotation best supports a main idea of the article?\
(A) “He expected to find whole flakes that were the same . . .” (paragraph 4)\
 (B) “ ‘Fussing with snow is just foolishness,’ his father said.” (paragraph 6)\
 (C) “Even so his first pictures were failures . . .” (paragraph 7)\
 (D) “ ‘Now everyone can see the great beauty in a tiny crystal,’ he said.”\

 Reading Comprehension Passage A\
 \
 The Count and the Wedding Guest\
 \
    Miss Maggie Conway and Mr. Andy Donovan are staying at the same boarding house in New York City.\
 \
    …Just coming out the door was Miss Conway. She wore a night-black dress of\
 crêpe de—crêpe de—oh, this thin black goods.(goods - fabric) Her hat was black, and from it drooped and\
 fluttered an ebon veil, filmy as a spider’s web. She stood on the top step and drew on black\
 silk gloves. Not a speck of white or a spot of color about her dress anywhere. Her rich\
 (line 5) golden hair was drawn, with scarcely a ripple, into a shining, smooth knot low on her neck.\
 Her face was plain rather than pretty, but it was now illuminated and made almost beautiful\
 by her large gray eyes that gazed above the houses across the street into the sky with an\
 expression of the most appealing sadness and melancholy. …\
    “It’s a fine, clear evening, Miss Conway,” he [Andy Donovan] said; and if the Weather\
 (line 10) Bureau could have heard the confident emphasis of his tones it would have hoisted the\
 square white signal, (square white signal - a sign of good weather) and nailed it to the mast.\
    “To them that has the heart to enjoy it, it is, Mr. Donovan,” said Miss Conway, with\
 a sigh. …\
    “I hope none of your relatives—I hope you haven’t sustained a loss?” ventured\
 (line 15) Mr. Donovan.\
    “Death has claimed,” said Miss Conway, hesitating—“not a relative, but one who—but\
 I will not intrude my grief upon you, Mr. Donovan.”\
    “Intrude?” protested Mr. Donovan. “Why, say, Miss Conway, I’d be delighted, that is,\
 I’d be sorry—I mean I’m sure nobody could sympathize with you truer than I would.”\
 (line 20)   Miss Conway smiled a little smile. And oh, it was sadder than her expression in repose. (repose - at rest) …\
    “It’s tough to be alone in New York—that’s a cinch,” said Mr. Donovan. “But, say—\
 whenever this little old town does loosen up and get friendly it goes the limit. Say you took\
 a little stroll in the park, Miss Conway—don’t you think it might chase away some of your\
 mullygrubs? And if you’d allow me—”\
 (line 25)   “Thanks, Mr. Donovan. I’d be pleased to accept of your escort if you think the company\
 of one whose heart is filled with gloom could be anyways agreeable to you.”\
    Through the open gates of the iron-railed, old, downtown park, where the elect once\
 took the air, they strolled, and found a quiet bench. …\
    “He was my fiancé,” confided Miss Conway, at the end of an hour. “We were going to\
 (line 30) be married next spring. I don’t want you to think that I am stringing you, Mr. Donovan, but\
 he was a real Count. He had an estate and a castle in Italy. Count Fernando Mazzini was\
 his name. I never saw the beat of him for elegance. Papa objected, of course, and once \
 we eloped, but papa overtook us, and took us back. I thought sure papa and Fernando \
 would fight a duel. Papa has a livery business—in P’kipsee [Poughkeepsie], you know.” … \
 (line 35)    “Three days ago I got a letter from Italy, forwarded from P’kipsee, saying that Fernando \
 had been killed in a gondola accident.” … \
    “I’ve got his picture here in my locket,” said Miss Conway, after wiping her eyes with \
 her handkerchief. “I never showed it to anybody; but I will to you, Mr. Donovan, because \
 I believe you to be a true friend.” \
 (line 40)   Mr. Donovan gazed long and with much interest at the photograph in the locket that \
 Miss Conway opened for him. The face of Count Mazzini was one to command interest. \
 It was a smooth, intelligent, bright, almost a handsome face—the face of a strong, cheerful \
 man who might well be a leader among his fellows. \
    “I have a larger one, framed, in my room,” said Miss Conway. “When we return I will\
 (line 45) show you that. They are all I have to remind me of Fernando. But he ever will be present \
 in my heart, that’s a sure thing.” \
    A subtle task confronted Mr. Donovan,—that of supplanting (supplanting - replacing) the unfortunate Count in \
 the heart of Miss Conway. This his admiration for her determined him to do. But the \
 magnitude of the undertaking did not seem to weigh upon his spirits. The sympathetic but\
 (line 50) cheerful friend was the role he essayed; (essayed - attempted) and he played it so successfully that the next \
 half-hour found them conversing pensively across two plates of ice-cream, though yet there \
 was no diminution of the sadness in Miss Conway’s large gray eyes. \
    Before they parted in the hall that evening she ran upstairs and brought down the \
 framed photograph wrapped lovingly in a white silk scarf. Mr. Donovan surveyed it with\
 (line 55) inscrutable (inscrutable - unreadable) eyes. … \
    “A fine-looking man,” said Mr. Donovan, heartily. “How would it suit you, Miss Conway, \
 to give me the pleasure of your company to Coney [Island] next Sunday afternoon?” \
    A month later they announced their engagement to Mrs. Scott and the other boarders. \
 Miss Conway continued to wear black.\
 (line 60)   A week after the announcement the two sat on the same bench in the downtown park, \
 while the fluttering leaves of the trees made a dim kinetoscopic (kinetoscopic - flickering) picture of them in the \
 moonlight. But Donovan had worn a look of abstracted gloom all day. He was so silent \
 to-night that love’s lips could not keep back any longer the questions that love’s heart \
 propounded. (propounded - put forward)\
 (line 65)   “What’s the matter, Andy, you are so solemn and grouchy to-night?”\
    “Nothing, Maggie.”\
    “I know better. Can’t I tell? You never acted this way before. What is it?” … \
    “I’ll tell you then,” said Andy, wisely, “but I guess you won’t understand it exactly. \
 You’ve heard of Mike Sullivan, haven’t you? ‘Big Mike’ Sullivan, everybody calls him.”\
 (line 70)   “No, I haven’t,” said Maggie. “And I don’t want to, if he makes you act like this. Who is \
 he?” …\
    “Well, Big Mike’s a friend of mine. I ain’t more than deuce-high in the district as far as \
 influence goes, but Mike’s as good a friend to a little man, or a poor man as he is to a big \
 one. I met him to-day on the Bowery [Street], and what do you think he does? Comes up\
 (line 75) and shakes hands. ‘Andy,’ says he, ‘I’ve been keeping cases on you. You’ve been putting in \
 some good licks over on your side of the street, and I’m proud of you. What’ll you take to \
 drink?’ He takes a cigar, and I take a highball. I told him I was going to get married in two \
 weeks. ‘Andy,’ says he, ‘send me an invitation, so I’ll keep in mind of it, and I’ll come to the \
 wedding.’ That’s what Big Mike says to me; and he always does what he says. \
 (line 80)   “You don’t understand it, Maggie, but I’d have one of my hands cut off to have Big Mike \
 Sullivan at our wedding. It would be the proudest day of my life. When he goes to a man’s \
 wedding, there’s a guy being married that’s made for life. Now, that’s why I’m maybe looking \
 sore to-night.”\
    “Why don’t you invite him, then, if he’s so much to the mustard?” (to the mustard - successful) said Maggie, lightly. …\
 (line 85)   “Maggie,” said Andy, presently, “do you think as much of me as you did of your—as you \
 did of the Count Mazzini?”\
    He waited a long time, but Maggie did not reply. And then, suddenly she leaned against \
 his shoulder and began to cry—to cry and shake with sobs, holding his arm tightly, and \
 wetting the crêpe de Chine with tears. …\
 (line 90)   But instead of being pushed away, she found Andy’s arm folding her closer. She looked \
 up and saw his face cleared and smiling. …\
    “Andy,” said Maggie, with a somewhat shy smile, after she had been thoroughly assured \
 of forgiveness, “did you believe all that story about the Count?” \
    “Well, not to any large extent,” said Andy, reaching for his cigar case, “because it’s\
 (line 95) Big Mike Sullivan’s picture you’ve got in that locket of yours.” \

 Excerpt from River of Dreams\
 \
 by Hudson Talbott\
 \
 (paragraph 1) By the twentieth century, New York City had long since reached its destiny of becoming the most powerful city in America. In less than 300 years it had grown from a tiny Dutch outpost in the wilderness to the business capital of the world. It was a city built on dreams.\
 \
 (paragraph 2) But it was made out of bricks and cement that had come from the banks of the Hudson. The river which had fed all those dreams was now fading into the background. New York didn’t seem to need the river anymore, except as a sewer. And that’s what it became.\
 \
 (paragraph 3) Industry on the river had made some New Yorkers filthy rich. But it had just made the river filthy. Garbage, factory waste, plant chemicals and the raw sewage of the cities and towns along its banks were dumped directly into the river. The water turned greenish brown, except by the GM plant, where it turned red or yellow or whatever color they were painting the cars that day.\
 \
 (paragraph 4) The fishing industry collapsed. The few fish that survived were too poisonous to eat. Smog from the factory smoke and dust from the cement plants blanketed the valley. And it was all legal.\
 \
 (paragraph 5) Most people don’t start out with dreams of polluting a river. But it was often the result of people chasing their dreams of wealth with little care of how they reached it. The Hudson Valley had always drawn them.\
 \
 (paragraph 6) But now there were other dreamers in the valley, with their own dreams of wealth. They dreamed of the wealth of wildlife in a healthy forest, the abundance of fish in oxygen-rich water, and the great fortune of living in a beautiful river valley.\
 \
 (paragraph 7) So perhaps it was a matter of time before the two types of dreamers would meet each other—in court.\
 \
 (paragraph 8) In 1963, Con Edison, New York City’s power company, proposed a plan for constructing the largest hydroelectric pumping station ever built. The plan called for carving out a gigantic hole in the side of majestic Storm King Mountain on the Hudson River.\
 \
 (paragraph 9) But then they met Franny Reese. Franny was a longtime valley resident with a simple point to make: the mountain could not speak for itself. If she didn’t speak for it, who would?\
 \
 (paragraph 10) Franny and a group of like-minded people founded Scenic Hudson and took on the power company in a landmark court case. Con Ed challenged the right of private citizens to participate, but the court sided with the citizens, in the ruling now known as the Scenic Hudson Decision.\
 \
 (paragraph 11) After dragging out the case for seventeen years, Con Ed finally gave up and Storm King survived unblemished. It was the beginning of the environmental movement in this country, and once again, the Hudson Valley was the birthplace.\
 \
 (paragraph 12) More and more people joined the movement as they realized how much difference each of us can make.\
 \
 (paragraph 13) The love of their land was still alive in the hearts of Americans, and now that it was aroused again, things began to change.\
 \
 (paragraph 14) Many new laws and new citizens’ groups have been inspired by those early heroes of the environment, and their work has begun to bring the Hudson back to life.\
 \
 (paragraph 15) The Mahicans called it “The River That Flows Both Ways.” Slowly we are learning that taking care of the river is the only way that the river can take care of us.\
 \
 (paragraph 16) Fifty years have passed since I dreamed of going to New York to see the river that shares my name, and thirty-five years since that dream came true. I live in the Hudson Valley now, grateful to all those who came before me, following their dreams to this river, building this nation, sharing its beauty, securing its future.\
 \
 (paragraph 17) It’s now my turn to help in keeping the river of dreams flowing, for all those dreamers yet to come.\
What is the role of paragraph 7 in the organization of the article?\
(A) It compares the two groups of dreamers.\
 (B) It concludes the part of the article about industry.\
 (C) It introduces the part of the article about activists.\
 (D) It transitions to the part of the article where change occurs.\

The First Public Park\
 by Marcia Amidon Lusted\
 \
 It was just an idea for more than a decade, but by 1857, New Yorkers were serious\
 about building a grand public park. New York was the largest metropolis in the nation,\
 and its citizens wanted to show the world that Americans were not just concerned about\
 industry, wealth, and materialism but that they also appreciated natural landscapes.\
 (line 5) Using eminent domain, the city took more than 840 acres of land in the center of\
 Manhattan for the new park. The area was considered to lack any real estate value—it\
 included swamps, bluffs, and rock outcroppings as well as two reservoirs that supplied city\
 water. It was home to about 1,600 poor residents, however. This population of pig farmers,\
 gardeners, and an African American settlement called Seneca Village was displaced by the\
 (line 10) park’s construction.\
 The Central Park Commission held a competition to choose someone to design the\
 park. Among the professional and amateur designers who entered the contest was a team\
 consisting of an American agriculturalist and a British-born architect: Frederick Law\
 Olmsted and Calvert Vaux.\
 (line 15) It was Vaux’s idea for the two men to join forces. A talented draftsman, Vaux used his\
 detailed drawings to show how their idea for the park would look. An accomplished\
 writer, Olmsted wrote the report that described their plan and included lists of proposed\
 plants and an estimated budget. They submitted their plan, called “Greensward,” a day\
 after the commission’s deadline.\
 (line 20) Greensward included pastoral views and rolling meadows, just like those in traditional\
 English parks. The plan offered beautiful vistas of green lawns and natural rocky ridges as\
 well as more formal locations for public gatherings.\
 It also included four roads that cut through the park to carry carriage traffic from one\
 side to the other. Olmsted and Vaux designed these major thoroughfares to run eight feet\
 (line 25) below the park’s surface so they would not disrupt the park’s views and rural feeling.\
 Pedestrian paths, equestrian roads, and carriage drives were all kept separate from one\
 another. Vaux designed more than 40 bridges so that these various paths would never have\
 to cross on the same level.\
 Unlike some of the other submissions that included grand, elaborate buildings,\
 (line 30) Olmsted and Vaux kept structures to a minimum, with only four in the original plan. The\
 design and materials for the buildings were also specifically selected to blend in with the\
 natural environment.\
 Greensward was announced the winner in the spring of 1858. The selection committee\
 debated over certain design points—some of the members wanted a wide grand avenue in\
 (line 35) the park, similar to those found in European parks. Olmsted argued against it by saying\
 that stately roads would “destroy scenery at great cost” and that “straight lines of trees or\
 stately architecture . . . belong not to parks for the people but to palatial gardens.” Olmsted\
 and Vaux had created their design for the recreation of all people, not just the wealthy.\
 The park was to be a place where all New Yorkers could enjoy nature. Its ultimate design\
 (line 40) would retain this feeling.\
 The construction of Central Park was one of the most massive public works projects\
 to take place in 19th-century New York. It required about 20,000 workers to reshape the\
 natural features of the land according to Olmsted and Vaux’s plan. Three hundred\
 thousand cubic yards of rock were blasted into rubble, and the resulting stone was crushed\
 (line 45) to use as paving material. Nearly three million cubic yards of soil were moved, and more\
 than 270,000 trees and shrubs were planted. Swamps were transformed into scenic lakes,\
 and extensive drainage work was done to get rid of small streams and pools. By 1866,\
 more than $5 million had been spent on construction. The park’s final price tag was more\
 than $10 million. In the end, this entirely planned park, stretching from 59th Street to\
 (line 50) 110th Street and from Fifth to Eighth avenues, had a completely natural, unplanned\
 feeling to it.\
 The process of overseeing the park’s construction and accounting for its expenditures\
 exhausted Olmsted. He required a six-week rest cure in Europe in 1859 and suffered a\
 severe broken leg in 1860 that laid him up, but he had the plans for the park spread out in\
 (line 55) his bedroom so he could continue to work. When he tried to resign from the project in\
 1861, however, the commission knew that it could not afford to lose him. Ultimately,\
 Olmsted’s duties and responsibilities were decreased, and when he departed the project to\
 serve in the U.S. Sanitary Commission during the Civil War (1861–1865), the park’s\
 construction was completed under park commission president Andrew Green and Vaux.\
 (line 60) Olmsted’s involvement in Central Park spanned nearly 20 years. It was not the only\
 site he worked or consulted on, and, for a couple of years, other projects demanded his\
 full attention. But from the time their plan was selected until the mid-1870s, Olmsted and\
 Vaux were associated with the park on and off. Sometimes, their titles as landscape\
 architect advisors required little on-site work. At other times, such as when Olmsted filled\
 (line 65) in as acting president of the Department of Public Parks, he looked into establishing lights\
 in the park at night and assessing the park’s safety. By 1878, however, Olmsted’s role with\
 the park officially ended.\
 Today, Central Park stands as one of Olmsted’s greatest legacies. It contains numerous\
 playgrounds and athletic fields. Runners and bicyclists make use of the wide, rolling paths.\
 (line 70) There are places to skate in the winter and boat in the summer. Concerts, plays, and rallies\
 take place there. Sculptures by famous artists can be found throughout the park. There are\
 also quiet places to walk, sit and read a book, or watch birds. Central Park has become a\
 world-famous site that attracts more than 25 million visitors each year. It also is a shining\
 example of Olmsted’s desire to create and preserve public green spaces in urban places for\
 (line 75) generations of people to enjoy.\
Based on evidence from the article, which claim is most accurate?\
(A) Olmsted and Vaux were hired based on their reputations.\
 (B) The scale and design of the project made Central Park remarkable for its time.\
 (C) Americans had a greater appreciation of nature than did Europeans.\
 (D) Central Park today hosts a greater array of activities than it did in the past.\

Excerpt from The Call of Coney Island\
 \
 by Cynthia Overbeck Bix\
 \
 (paragraph 1) Salty ocean smells mingle with the aromas of sweet cotton candy and Nathan’s Famous hot dogs. The legendary Cyclone roller coaster lurches along its tracks—then takes a heart-stopping plunge. Riders whoop and scream with excitement. Farther down the boardwalk, the sound of a carousel starts. Patrons pitch balls at moving targets, hoping to win a prize. Welcome to Coney Island, the nation’s first truly modern amusement area.\
 \
 (paragraph 2) Located on the southern tip of Brooklyn, New York, Coney Island has been the place to go for fun for more than a century. The inspiration for amusement parks such as Coney Island sprang from an exciting event in 1893—the World’s Columbian Exposition in Chicago. It was one of the first venues where people experienced a variety of attractions in one large space. \
 \
 (paragraph 3) Visitors to Chicago gasped in wonder when they saw the fair’s “White City” spread out before them. Beautiful all-white exhibition buildings and large classical statues framed a lagoon of shimmering water. Designed to educate and inform, about a dozen grand buildings housed displays on the latest developments in transportation, machinery, agriculture, art, horticulture, and more. Most visitors had never seen the things they saw there, such as electric lights, a moving sidewalk, world-famous artwork, and moving pictures.\
 \
 (paragraph 4) While the World’s Columbian Exposition awed people with new innovations and ideas, its most popular attraction was the Midway Plaisance. Located in a separate section of the exhibition grounds, the Midway was filled with entertainment: rides, food stands, and sideshows. People could get a taste of international cultures, for example, by riding a camel through the Streets of Cairo or strolling among the thatched huts of a South Sea village. Best of all, they could ride George Ferris’s giant spinning wheel. Rising 264 feet above the Midway, this engineering marvel became the star of the fair. It was a spectacular example of what the new age of machines made possible.\
 \
 (paragraph 5) One visitor, New York showman George C. Tilyou, immediately saw potential for this new form of entertainment. Tilyou owned property on Coney Island, which already was an established beach resort with hotels, bathhouses, and restaurants. It also featured an odd collection of sideshows, food vendors, fortunetellers, and more. Tilyou decided to build an enclosed amusement park there.\
 \
 (paragraph 6) In 1897, Tilyou opened Steeplechase Park. When he was unable to buy Ferris’s wheel, he had his own version built. For 25 cents, visitors could ride Tilyou’s wheel, enjoy the Scenic Railway, or climb into a “spaceship” for a Trip to the Moon. On the Steeplechase, wooden horses carried riders along a metal racetrack from a starting gate to a finish line.\
 \
 (paragraph 7) Steeplechase Park’s huge success was partly due to another invention—electric railways. The first electric trolley line had connected Manhattan Island and Coney Island in the mid-1800s. By the turn of the 20th century, an electric train offered an even faster way to carry more people wanting to escape from the hot, crowded city.\
 \
 (paragraph 8) In the late 1800s and early 1900s, most people worked long hours and six days a week in urban factories and shops. But for a nickel fare, a city worker could afford a day’s outing to a nearby park on Sundays. Recognizing the value of giving the working class access to day trips, trolley and train companies established parks that were located at the end of a line. Travelers disembarked to enjoy simple outdoor pleasures in picnic groves and swimming pools or beaches. Eventually, merry-go-rounds, penny arcades, (penny arcades - indoor area with amusements such as games and photo booths operated by placing a coin in a slot) and even small roller coasters were added. . . .\
 \
 (paragraph 9) Part sideshow, part circus, part theme park, Coney Island set an example for amusement parks. Attractions that are so familiar today—roller coasters, water rides, fun houses, Tunnels of Love—all got their start there.\
 \
 (paragraph 10) Many amusement parks closed during the Great Depression in the 1930s or during World War II (1939–1945). Coney Island has had its ups and downs, too. Over the decades, fires and age destroyed some of the original attractions. In 2012, Superstorm Sandy wrecked the boardwalk and many of the attractions.\
 \
 (paragraph 11) In spite of all that, Coney Island has survived, and it is still operating today. It continues to offer each new generation of kids (and their parents) a chance to escape to a special world of entertainment and thrills. And from New Jersey’s Wildwood Park to California’s Pacific Park and Florida’s Walt Disney World, other amusement and theme parks have taken their cues from Coney Island. They have grown to epic proportions in their efforts to offer a world full of fun.\
Based on paragraphs 10 and 11, what is the author's point of view?\
(A) Newer amusement parks offer families more fun than Coney Island.\
 (B) Coney Island should be modernized in order to keep attracting visitors.\
 (C) It has cost too much money to restore Coney Island after recent difficulties\
 (D) Coney Island remains an exciting destination for visitors after many years\

Base your answer to question 22 on the passage below and on your knowledge of social studies.\
 \
 . . . From the beginning of the revolution there had been many aborted [failed] attempts to impose the veil on women; these attempts failed because of persistent and militant resistance put up mainly by Iranian women. In many important ways the veil had gained a symbolic significance for the regime. Its reimposition [reinstatement] would signify the complete victory of the Islamic aspect of the revolution, which in those first years was not a foregone conclusion. The unveiling of women mandated by Reza Shah in 1936 had been a controversial symbol of modernization, a powerful sign of the reduction of the clergy’s power. It was important for the ruling clerics to reassert that power. All this I can explain now, with the advantage of hindsight, but it was far from clear then. . .\

 …Ivory and slaves had been the Congo’s main exports, but Leopold focused on rubber. The mass marketing of bicycles and automobiles in the 1890s greatly increased the demand for rubber and sent prices soaring. When a rubber producing vine was discovered in the rainforests of Congo in 1890, Leopold forced out the competition and acquired a monopoly on the scarce commodity. By one estimate, the Congo was producing 20,000 tons of crude rubber a year at a 900 percent profit. The high return was due largely to cheap labor.…\

 Excerpt from The Woolly-Puff Rescue\
 \
 by Sue Mozena\
 \
 (paragraph 1) Wendy and Alex stared at the strange ﬂower at their feet. Dozens of them bloomed in this remote corner of the ﬁeld.\
 \
 (paragraph 2) Wendy bent down for a closer look. “We shouldn’t name them until we’re sure we can keep them,” she warned. “But I like Woolly-Puffs. They look just like ﬂeecy rainbows.”\
 \
 (paragraph 3) As tempting as it was to pet the feathery yellow-orange-red-purple-blue petals, neither of them did. Instead, Wendy pulled protective gloves from her belt pack.\
 \
 (paragraph 4) On the asteroid-based colony of New Harmony, even twelve-year-old pioneers knew the number one rule for living in outer space: don’t touch or taste or sniff anything that hasn’t been tested.\

 (paragraph 5) “Where do you think they came from?” Wendy asked. With a gentle tug, she freed a Woolly-Puff from the thin layer of soil, sealed it in a clear bag.\
 \
 (paragraph 6) “They were probably in the compost shipment that brought these naggers,” Alex muttered. He slapped at one of the whining insects that swarmed around him looking for exposed skin to bite.\
 \
 compost = a mixture of decaying plants used to improve the soil in a garden\
 \
 (paragraph 7) New Harmony depended on shipments of rich compost from nearby planets to build up its soil. Usually the compost was treated before it arrived, but one shipment had been accidentally overlooked. The whining gnat-like insects the colonists called “naggers” had hatched from the compost. Without any natural enemies in this new world, the insects had multiplied, becoming a constant torment to the colonists.\
 \
 (paragraph 8) After turning in their discovery, Wendy settled on a stone bench in front of the New Harmony laboratory. Alex paced, then sat. “Poor Woolly-Puff,” Wendy said. “What if it’s just a weedy ﬂower?”\
 \
 (paragraph 9) “Then one living plant and a packet of seeds will be sent to the Botany Preserve on Mars,” Alex answered, rubbing a hot-pink nagger welt just above his elbow.\
 \
 (paragraph 10) Wendy gingerly held the extra bouquet she had picked, in case the Woolly-Puffs proved keepers. “And the rest of the plants—”\
 \
 (paragraph 11) “The rest will be pulled up and destroyed to make room for ‘useful’ plants,” Alex said.\
 \
 (paragraph 12) The colony of New Harmony did have ﬂowers. It just didn’t have a lot of room. Woolly-Puffs would have to be more than pretty if they wanted to grow here.\
 \
 (paragraph 13) The two friends scrambled to attention as the lab door opened.\
 \
 (paragraph 14) “Your Woolly-Puff isn’t toxic,” Professor Raglin said. His smile faded as he went on. “The sap is thick and sticky, but we already have a good glue. The stems are too woody and the leaves too bristly to eat. And the petals, well, they smell funny. Not ﬂowery at all. More like moldy lemons. I’m sorry, but I’ll have to make my report to the council this afternoon. The good news is that they seem to grow only in the soil where you found them, so it won’t be hard to get rid of them.”\
 \
 (paragraph 15) “At least they’re not poison,” Wendy said after Professor Raglin had left. She hugged her colorful, fuzzy bouquet. She had to admit they did smell funny. “Mayor Murphy will probably send a reclaim crew out after the council meeting.” She sighed. “I wish the council would let us adopt one, like a pet.”\
 \
 (paragraph 16) “Fat chance,” Alex said. He blew at a pair of naggers trying to land on his knee. “Shoo! For harmless gnats, these bugs sure are pests.”\
 \
 (paragraph 17) “Yeah.” Wendy reached up to scratch the end of her nose. Then she realized something. The end of her nose itched simply because that’s what the ends of noses do sometimes. The naggers weren’t biting her. They weren’t even landing on her.\
 \
 (paragraph 18) “We’re going to the council meeting,” she announced.\
 \
 (paragraph 19) That afternoon, when the council members emerged from the community center, Alex and Wendy were waiting.\
 \
 (paragraph 20) “What is the meaning of this?” Mayor Murphy demanded as Alex and Wendy presented each member of the council with a Woolly-Puff garland.\
 \
 (paragraph 21) Glancing at Alex for courage, Wendy said, “Woolly-Puffs are bug chasers.”\
 \
 (paragraph 22) “Sorry,” Mayor Murphy said ﬁrmly. “We have already made our decision.”\
 \
 (paragraph 23) “Just watch,” Wendy pleaded. “Watch the naggers.”\
 \
 (paragraph 24) Then someone said, “What naggers? I don’t see any.”\
 \
 (paragraph 25) “Where are the naggers?” asked Professor Raglin. “It’s as if they’re avoiding us.”\
 \
 (paragraph 26) Wendy smiled. “They are. Naggers don’t like Woolly-Puffs.”\
 \
 (paragraph 27) So the Woolly-Puffs stayed in the vases and ﬂower boxes and gardens of New Harmony because, of course, they weren’t just pretty. They smelled like moldy lemons. And luckily, naggers couldn’t stand the smell of moldy lemons.\

Excerpt from One-Eyed Cat\
 by Paula Fox\
 \
 Ned loved snow, the whisper when he walked through it, a sound like candles being\
 blown out, the coming indoors out of it into the warmth, and standing on the register in\
 the big hall through which the dusty, metal-smelling heat blew up, and the going back out\
 again, shivering, cold, stooping and scooping up a handful to make a snowball, packing it\
 (line 5) hard with wet mittens, hefting it, tossing it as far as he could, and the runners of his sled\
 whispering across it as he sleighed down the slopes which were smooth and glittering and\
 hard, like great jewels.\
 On the first of December, there was a heavy snowfall. When Ned looked out of his\
 window the next morning, the river glowed like a snake made out of light as it wound\
 (line 10) among the snow-covered mountains.\
 He ate breakfast hastily, too preoccupied to read the story on the cereal box.\
 Mrs. Scallop (Mrs. Scallop: Ned’s family’s housekeeper) was broody this morning and left him a lone, her glance passing over him as\
 it passed over the kitchen chairs.\
 On the porch, he paused to take deep breaths of air which tasted, he imagined, like\
 (line 15) water from the center of the ocean, then he waded into the snow, passing the Packard (Packard: a brand of car that is no longer manufactured), its\
 windows white and hidden, the crabapple tree with its weighted branches, down the long\
 hill trying to guess if he was anywhere near the buried driveway. By the time he reached\
 Mr. Scully’s house, his galoshes were topped with snow and his feet were wet. Mr. Scully’s\
 shades were drawn; the house had a pinched look as though it felt the cold.\
 (line 20) Ned went around to the back until he could see the shed. There were boot tracks in\
 the snow leading to it and returning to the back door. He guessed the old man had taken\
 in the cat’s bowl; it was nowhere to be seen. You couldn’t leave anything out in this\
 weather, it would freeze. Mr. Scully had told him that finding water in the winter was a\
 big problem for animals. Licking the snow or ice could make them sick.\
 (line 25) Ned stared hard at the shed. Perhaps the cat was inside, squeezed in behind logs in a\
 tight space where its own breath would keep it warm. He was going to be late to school if\
 he didn’t get a move on, but he kept looking hard all over the yard as though he could\
 make the cat appear out of snow and gray sky. Twice, his glance passed over the icebox.\
 The third time, he saw that the motionless mound on top of it was not only the quilt but\
 (line 30) the cat, joined into one shape by a dusting of snow.\
 Ned held his breath for a moment, then put his own feet in Mr. Scully’s tracks and\
 went toward the shed. The tracks had frozen and they crunched under Ned’s weight, but\
 the cat didn’t raise its head. Ned halted a few feet away from it—but of course, he realized,\
 it wouldn’t hear him because of its deaf ear. He could have gone closer to it than he’d ever\
 (line 35) been but he had a sudden vision of the cat exploding into fear when it finally did\
 hear him.\
 When he got back to the front of the house, he saw fresh footsteps on the road. He\
 could tell it was the road because of the deep ditches which fell away to either side. He\
 guessed they were Billy’s tracks. It was odd to think that Billy, huffing and puffing, had\
 (line 40) gone past Mr. Scully’s place, thinking his own thoughts, while he, Ned, only a few yards\
 away, had been searching for the cat. He found Evelyn’s tracks, too, and later on, Janet’s,\
 the smallest of all. He felt ghostly as if he’d been left alone on a white, silent globe.\
 Somewhere in the evergreen woods, snow must have slid off a bough, for he heard the\
 loud plop, then the fainter sound of the bough springing up, relieved of the weight. He\
 (line 45) thought about the cat, visualizing how it had looked on the quilt. How still it had been!\
 Why hadn’t he gone right up to it, looked at it close, touched its fur? Why had it been so\
 motionless—still as death, still as a dead vole he’d seen last summer in the grass near the\
 well? He came to the snow-covered blacktop road upon which a few cars had left their\
 ridged tire tracks. He had a strong impulse to turn back, to play hooky for the first time in\
 (line 50) his life. Mr. Scully, with his poor eyesight, might not spot the cat on top of the icebox,\
 might not, then, set food out for it. Fretting and shivering, his feet numb, Ned went on\
 to school.\
 He tried very hard to concentrate on his lessons, to watch Miss Jefferson’s plump, even\
 handwriting on the blackboard as she wrote out the lines from a poem by Thomas Gray\
 (line 55) that the class was to memorize that week, but try as he might, the image of the unmoving\
 animal on the ragged old quilt persisted. Last week, on a rainy afternoon, the cat had\
 looked at Ned, had cocked its head as though to see him better. Its one eye, narrowed, had\
 reminded him of a grain of wheat.\
 “The curfew tolls the knell of parting day,\
 (line 60) The lowing herd wind slowly o’er the lea . . .”\
 Ned read the lines several times before copying them down in his copybook. The\
 words made no sense to him. It was this that had made his hours in school so hard ever\
 since he and Mr. Scully had seen the cat last autumn, this drawing away of his attention\
 from everything that was going on around him. He was either relieved because the cat was\
 (line 65) where he could see it or fearful because he didn’t know where it was.\
Which quotation from the story best shows how the cat has impacted Ned’s life?\
(A) “He was going to be late to school if he didn’t get a move on, but he kept looking hard all over the yard as though he could make the cat appear out of snow and gray sky.” (lines 26 through 28)\
 (B) “The third time, he saw that the motionless mound on top of it was not only the quilt but the cat, joined into one shape by a dusting of snow.” (lines 29 and 30)\
 (C) “It was odd to think that Billy, huffing and puffing, had gone past Mr. Scully’s place, thinking his own thoughts, while he, Ned, only a few yards away, had been searching for the cat.” (lines 39 through 41)\
 (D) “It was this that had made his hours in school so hard ever since he and Mr. Scully had seen the cat last autumn, this drawing away of his attention from everything that was going on around him.” (lines 62 through 64)\

Reading Comprehension Passage B\
 \
 Amazement Awaits\
 \
 Written on the occasion of the 2008 Olympics at the request of the Olympic Committee\
 \
 Sheer amazement awaits\
 Amazement luxuriant in promise\
 Abundant in wonder\
 Our beautiful children arrive at this Universal stadium.\
 \
 (line 5) They have bathed in the waters of the world\
 And carry the soft silt of the Amazon, the Nile,\
 The Danube, the Rhine, the Yangtze and the Mississippi\
 In the palms of their right hands.\
 A wild tiger nestles in each armpit\
 (line 10) And a meadowlark perches on each shoulder.\
 \
 We, the world audience, stand, arms akimbo, (akimbo — with hands on hips and elbows turned outward)\
 Longing for the passion of the animal:\
 The melody of the lark\
 And the tigers’ passion\
 (line 15) Attend the opening bells,\
 The birds sing of the amazement which awaits\
 \
 The miracle of joy that comes out of the gathering of our best,\
 bringing their best,\
 Displaying the splendor of their bodies and the radiance of their\
 (line 20) agile minds to the cosmos.\
 \
 Encouragement to those other youth caught in the maws (maws — jaws) of poverty,\
 Crippled by the terror of ignorance.\
 \
 They say,\
 Brothers and Sisters,\
 (line 25) Yes, try.\
 Then try harder.\
 Lunge forward, press eagerly for release.\
 The amazement which awaits is for you.\
 \
 We are here at the portal of the world we had wished for\
 (line 30) At the lintel (lintel — a horizontal support above a door or window) of the world we most need.\
 We are here roaring and singing.\
 We prove that we can not only make peace, we can bring it with us.\
 \
 With respect for the world and its people,\
 We can compete passionately without hatred.\
 (line 35) With respect for the world and its people,\
 We can take pride in the achievement of strangers.\
 With respect for the world and its people,\
 We can share openly in the success of friends.\
 \
 Here then is the Amazement:\
 (line 40) Against the odds of impending war,\
 In the mouth of bloody greed,\
 Human grace and human spirit can still conquer.\
 \
 Ah…\
 We discover, we ourselves\
 (line 45) Are the Amazement which awaits\
 We are ourselves Amazement.\
 \

Iranian women made considerable progress during the Pahlavi era (1925–1979). Education for both girls and boys was free. When Tehran University opened in 1936, Iran’s first university admitted both men and women. In 1963, women acquired the right to vote and run for parliament. Under the Family Protection Law, women won the right to petition for divorce and gain child custody. A husband could no longer unilaterally [single-handedly] divorce his wife or automatically gain custody of the children. The marriage age for girls was raised from 13 to 18. And men needed the court’s permission to take a second wife. By 1978, on the eve of Iran’s revolution, 22 women sat in parliament and 333 women served on elected local councils. One-third of university students were female. Two million women were in the work force, more than 146,000 of them in the civil service. . . .\
 \
 Under revolutionary leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, Iran’s new theocracy gave priority to Islamic tradition over modern mores [practices]. One of the revolutionary government’s first acts was to suspend the Family Protection Law and dismantle Family Courts. Men were once again free to divorce their wives by simple declaration; they also gained exclusive custody of their children. Women could no longer file for divorce unless the right was stipulated [clearly stated] in marriage contracts, and they lost the right to child custody. Restrictions on polygamy were also removed. The marriage age for girls was reduced to puberty, which is nine under Islamic law. In 1981, parliament approved the Islamic Law of Retribution, introducing flogging, stoning and payment of blood money for crimes ranging from adultery to violation of Islamic dress codes. . . .\

Based on this passage, what conclusion can be made regarding the tensions between tradition and modernity in Iran?\
(1) Before the revolution, the Pahlavis encouraged people to stay within traditional Islamic norms.\
 (2) The new theocratic government encouraged modernity and the expansion of rights.\
 (3) Ayatollah Khomeini’s revolutionaries favored a more traditional patriarchal society.\
 (4) After the revolution, movement toward modernity was hindered by limitations placed on males in Iranian society.\

This excerpt is from a book about the history of the Hudson River.\
 \
 Excerpt from River of Dreams\
 by Hudson Talbott\
 \
 (paragraph 1) By the twentieth century, New York City had long since reached its destiny of\
 becoming the most powerful city in America. In less than 300 years it had grown from\
 a tiny Dutch outpost in the wilderness to the business capital of the world. It was a city\
 built on dreams.\
 (paragraph 2) But it was made out of bricks and cement that had come from the banks of the\
 Hudson. The river which had fed all those dreams was now fading into the background.\
 New York didn’t seem to need the river anymore, except as a sewer. And that’s what it\
 became.\
 (paragraph 3) Industry on the river had made some New Yorkers filthy rich. But it had just made\
 the river filthy. Garbage, factory waste, plant chemicals and the raw sewage of the cities\
 and towns along its banks were dumped directly into the river. The water turned\
 greenish brown, except by the GM plant, where it turned red or yellow or whatever\
 color they were painting the cars that day.\
 (paragraph 4) The fishing industry collapsed. The few fish that survived were too poisonous to eat.\
 Smog from the factory smoke and dust from the cement plants blanketed the valley.\
 And it was all legal.\
 (paragraph 5) Most people don’t start out with dreams of polluting a river. But it was often the\
 result of people chasing their dreams of wealth with little care of how they reached it.\
 The Hudson Valley had always drawn them.\
 (paragraph 6) But now there were other dreamers in the valley, with their own dreams of wealth.\
 They dreamed of the wealth of wildlife in a healthy forest, the abundance of fish in\
 oxygen-rich water, and the great fortune of living in a beautiful river valley.\
 (paragraph 7) So perhaps it was a matter of time before the two types of dreamers would meet each\
 other—in court.\
 (paragraph 8) In 1963, Con Edison, New York City’s power company, proposed a plan for\
 constructing the largest hydroelectric pumping station ever built. The plan called for\
 carving out a gigantic hole in the side of majestic Storm King Mountain on the Hudson\
 River.\
 (paragraph 9) But then they met Franny Reese. Franny was a longtime valley resident with a simple\
 point to make: the mountain could not speak for itself. If she didn’t speak for it, who\
 would?\
 (paragraph 10) Franny and a group of like-minded people founded Scenic Hudson and took on the\
 power company in a landmark court case. Con Ed challenged the right of private\
 citizens to participate, but the court sided with the citizens, in the ruling now known as\
 the Scenic Hudson Decision.\
 (paragraph 11) After dragging out the case for seventeen years, Con Ed finally gave up and Storm\
 King survived unblemished. It was the beginning of the environmental movement in\
 this country, and once again, the Hudson Valley was the birthplace.\
 (paragraph 12) More and more people joined the movement as they realized how much difference\
 each of us can make.\
 (paragraph 13) The love of their land was still alive in the hearts of Americans, and now that it was\
 aroused again, things began to change.\
 (paragraph 14) Many new laws and new citizens’ groups have been inspired by those early heroes of\
 the environment, and their work has begun to bring the Hudson back to life.\
 (paragraph 15) The Mahicans called it “The River That Flows Both Ways.” Slowly we are learning\
 that taking care of the river is the only way that the river can take care of us.\
 (paragraph 16) Fifty years have passed since I dreamed of going to New York to see the river that\
 shares my name, and thirty-five years since that dream came true. I live in the Hudson\
 Valley now, grateful to all those who came before me, following their dreams to this\
 river, building this nation, sharing its beauty, securing its future.\
 (paragraph 17) It’s now my turn to help in keeping the river of dreams flowing, for all those\
 dreamers yet to come.\
What does “unblemished” mean as used in paragraph 11?\
(A) unaware\
 (B) unknown\
 (C) unharmed\
 (D) unstable\

 Excerpt from The Woolly-Puff Rescue\
 \
 by Sue Mozena\
 \
 (paragraph 1) Wendy and Alex stared at the strange ﬂower at their feet. Dozens of them bloomed in this remote corner of the ﬁeld.\
 \
 (paragraph 2) Wendy bent down for a closer look. “We shouldn’t name them until we’re sure we can keep them,” she warned. “But I like Woolly-Puffs. They look just like ﬂeecy rainbows.”\
 \
 (paragraph 3) As tempting as it was to pet the feathery yellow-orange-red-purple-blue petals, neither of them did. Instead, Wendy pulled protective gloves from her belt pack.\
 \
 (paragraph 4) On the asteroid-based colony of New Harmony, even twelve-year-old pioneers knew the number one rule for living in outer space: don’t touch or taste or sniff anything that hasn’t been tested.\
 \
 (paragraph 5) “Where do you think they came from?” Wendy asked. With a gentle tug, she freed a Woolly-Puff from the thin layer of soil, sealed it in a clear bag.\
 \
 (paragraph 6) “They were probably in the compost shipment that brought these naggers,” Alex muttered. He slapped at one of the whining insects that swarmed around him looking for exposed skin to bite.\
 \
 compost = a mixture of decaying plants used to improve the soil in a garden\
 \
 (paragraph 7) New Harmony depended on shipments of rich compost from nearby planets to build up its soil. Usually the compost was treated before it arrived, but one shipment had been accidentally overlooked. The whining gnat-like insects the colonists called “naggers” had hatched from the compost. Without any natural enemies in this new world, the insects had multiplied, becoming a constant torment to the colonists.\
 \
 (paragraph 8) After turning in their discovery, Wendy settled on a stone bench in front of the New Harmony laboratory. Alex paced, then sat. “Poor Woolly-Puff,” Wendy said. “What if it’s just a weedy ﬂower?”\
 \
 (paragraph 9) “Then one living plant and a packet of seeds will be sent to the Botany Preserve on Mars,” Alex answered, rubbing a hot-pink nagger welt just above his elbow.\
 \
 (paragraph 10) Wendy gingerly held the extra bouquet she had picked, in case the Woolly-Puffs proved keepers. “And the rest of the plants—”\
 \
 (paragraph 11) “The rest will be pulled up and destroyed to make room for ‘useful’ plants,” Alex said.\
 \
 (paragraph 12) The colony of New Harmony did have ﬂowers. It just didn’t have a lot of room. Woolly-Puffs would have to be more than pretty if they wanted to grow here.\
 \
 (paragraph 13) The two friends scrambled to attention as the lab door opened.\
 \
 (paragraph 14) “Your Woolly-Puff isn’t toxic,” Professor Raglin said. His smile faded as he went on. “The sap is thick and sticky, but we already have a good glue. The stems are too woody and the leaves too bristly to eat. And the petals, well, they smell funny. Not ﬂowery at all. More like moldy lemons. I’m sorry, but I’ll have to make my report to the council this afternoon. The good news is that they seem to grow only in the soil where you found them, so it won’t be hard to get rid of them.”\
 \
 (paragraph 15) “At least they’re not poison,” Wendy said after Professor Raglin had left. She hugged her colorful, fuzzy bouquet. She had to admit they did smell funny. “Mayor Murphy will probably send a reclaim crew out after the council meeting.” She sighed. “I wish the council would let us adopt one, like a pet.”\
 \
 (paragraph 16) “Fat chance,” Alex said. He blew at a pair of naggers trying to land on his knee. “Shoo! For harmless gnats, these bugs sure are pests.”\
 \
 (paragraph 17) “Yeah.” Wendy reached up to scratch the end of her nose. Then she realized something. The end of her nose itched simply because that’s what the ends of noses do sometimes. The naggers weren’t biting her. They weren’t even landing on her.\
 \
 (paragraph 18) “We’re going to the council meeting,” she announced.\
 \
 (paragraph 19) That afternoon, when the council members emerged from the community center, Alex and Wendy were waiting.\
 \
 (paragraph 20) “What is the meaning of this?” Mayor Murphy demanded as Alex and Wendy presented each member of the council with a Woolly-Puff garland.\
 \
 (paragraph 21) Glancing at Alex for courage, Wendy said, “Woolly-Puffs are bug chasers.”\
 \
 (paragraph 22) “Sorry,” Mayor Murphy said ﬁrmly. “We have already made our decision.”\
 \
 (paragraph 23) “Just watch,” Wendy pleaded. “Watch the naggers.”\
 \
 (paragraph 24) Then someone said, “What naggers? I don’t see any.”\
 \
 (paragraph 25) “Where are the naggers?” asked Professor Raglin. “It’s as if they’re avoiding us.”\
 \
 (paragraph 26) Wendy smiled. “They are. Naggers don’t like Woolly-Puffs.”\
 \
 (paragraph 27) So the Woolly-Puffs stayed in the vases and ﬂower boxes and gardens of New Harmony because, of course, they weren’t just pretty. They smelled like moldy lemons. And luckily, naggers couldn’t stand the smell of moldy lemons.\
Read this sentence from paragraph 14.\

(A) He is suffering from the bad smell.\
 (B) He regrets having to study the plant.\
 (C) He dislikes the plant he is talking about.\
 (D) He is about to deliver disappointing news.\

Alan is on a volcano on Titan, a moon of Saturn. As the story opens, Alan is stranded on its summit in his space crawler. Luckily, he has brought along his mechanical wings.\
 \
 Excerpt from Fly for Your Life\
 \
 by John Frizell\
 \
 (paragraph 1) Alan knew there was no way back to the base and no way the crew there could help him remotely—the other crawler was down for maintenance. He could go down this side of the stream for 23 kilometers, to a flat area where the flowing liquid would spread out and be shallow enough to cross; then go back 23 kilometers to the far side of the bridge. One problem: he would definitely run out of air before he got there.\
 \
 (paragraph 2) Then Alan thought of the folded flight wings he had attached to his suit. Could he fly across the river and then walk to the base? Some quick calculations showed it wouldn’t work. He had enough air, but the battery that powered the heater of the suit he wore to stay alive on Titan was only good for an hour, not the four-hour walk it would take to reach the base. Spacewalks were usually done trailing a power cable plugged in to the suit. The cable carried power from the crawler to supplement the suit’s battery. Without the supplemental power, he would freeze solid in 10 minutes once the battery was exhausted.\
 \
 (paragraph 3) Alan knew flying the whole way was impossible. Even with Titan’s thick atmosphere and low gravity the suit made flying hard work, worse than running uphill carrying a sack of cement. No one could stay aloft for more than 10 minutes. It would be at least a half-hour flight to the base.\
 \
 (paragraph 4) He needed more than wings alone to get back alive. Then it came to him. Bolted to the side of the crawler was a squat, black cylinder containing compressed nitrogen at 200 bar, compressed Titanian atmosphere in fact, used for cleaning gunk off the crawler’s treads. Alan struggled with the bolts, working carefully in the searing cold with tools as brittle as glass. When he had the cylinder off, propped up, and pointing at the sky, he put his wings on, and then took them off, repeating the task until he could do it without thinking about it. . . .\
 \
 (paragraph 5) He pulled the power cable out of his suit’s hip socket and, before he could change his mind, gave a sharp tug on a line that he had attached to the valve of the pressure cylinder. The cylinder hissed like a giant snake, as high-pressure nitrogen blasted out, and then shot into the sky. A length of climbing rope he had attached to it went taut and snatched him into the air, where he was buffeted and tossed by the jet of nitrogen pouring down on him. It was like being caught under a breaking wave, pounded again and again by the surf. He was directly under the cylinder, using his weight and drag to keep the nozzle pointed down as the cylinder lofted him into Titan’s sky. The ground beneath, blurred by the motion, made it impossible to gauge height or direction.\
 \
 (paragraph 6) Time slowed; his shuddering world narrowed to the readout of the Titan Positioning System (TPS)—the icy moon’s equivalent of GPS. Gradually, the pounding lessened as the rate of climb shown on the readout passed its peak and began falling. Alan waited. Just before it hit zero, he cut the rope. The cylinder, relieved of his drag, flew off, dwindling to a black dot and then disappearing into the empty sky above. Now he was coasting upward, propelled by the momentum imparted to him by the nitrogen rocket. He was high in the air, but already he was slowing under the drag of the thick atmosphere. He had to get the wings on before the downward fall began. Once he started to move with some speed, he would begin to spin and never get them on. The first wing stuck and he had to take his arm out of the loops and try again. . . .\
 \
 (paragraph 7) He was gathering speed on his way down before he got the second one on. He spread his wings and rolled into a comfortable position, soaring over the moon’s dimly lit surface. The TPS showed that he was heading away from the base. He banked in an easy curve and settled on a course for home. All he had to do was hold the wings rigid and enjoy the ride. He took an occasional flap, just for fun. . . .\
 \
 (paragraph 8) As Alan glided toward the base, he flapped more often, watching the height-abovesurface and distance-to-target displays. As they unwound, an unpleasant feeling, like a trace of the frigid atmosphere outside, crept into his stomach. His elevation was dropping dangerously, with over three kilometers left to go on distance-to-target. He could see details on the surface more clearly now, because he was flying so low. . . .\
 \
 (paragraph 9) Alan forced himself to stay calm. Panic would mean disaster. He started flapping his wings faster, faster, faster. . . . He could feel himself lifting with every beat of the massive appendages. Faster, faster, faster. . . . His descent rate began to slow, but the muscles in his arms burned with pain. . . .\
 \
 (paragraph 10) Time stretched out endlessly.\
 \
 (paragraph 11) The TPS buzzed loudly in his helmet. Target. the station’s beacon was directly below him. He could barely feel his arms, but something made them stop flapping. He gratefully fell out of the sky, wrapped in a ball of pain, with barely the strength to flare his wings one last time for a soft landing. . . .\
 \
 (paragraph 12) Then he saw someone running toward him with a power cable in hand. Voices boomed into his helmet. It sounded like the whole station was in the control room waiting to see if he had made it.\
 \
 (paragraph 13) “Alan! ALAN! Say something! Can you move? Are you receiving this?” He recognized the voice of the base leader. . . .\
 \
 (paragraph 14) As the crew lifted him carefully onto a stretcher, he looked up at Titan’s hazy sky. I flew for my life today, he thought. I survived. That’s the only record that matters.\
In paragraph 4, what is the effect of the simile “with tools as brittle as glass”?\
(A) It affects the plot by explaining that the tools were hard to see.\
 (B) It creates suspense by showing that the tools were missing some pieces.\
 (C) It adds to the setting by suggesting that the tools were reflecting light off the snow.\
 (D) It increases danger by emphasizing that the tools were breakable in the cold.\

Dear fellow countrymen, compatriots. Due to the situation which has evolved as a result of the formation of the Commonwealth of Independent States, I hereby discontinue my activities at the post of President of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.\

 I am making this decision on considerations of principle. I firmly came out in favor of the independence of nations and sovereignty for the republics. At the same time, I support the preservation of the union state and the integrity of this country.\

 The developments took a different course. The policy prevailed of dismembering this country and disuniting the state, which is something I cannot subscribe to. . . .\

“Janet Guthrie: Lady in the Fast\
 Lane” from Profifiles in Sports Courage\
 by Ken Rappoport\
 \
 (paragraph 1) It was no surprise that Janet Guthrie excelled at one of the most dangerous sports on Earth. She had always loved adventure and daring new experiences.\
 (paragraph 2) Janet was born on March 7, 1938, in Iowa City, Iowa, and lived on a farm for the first few years of her life. Her father, an airline pilot, later moved the family to South Florida, where Janet took up flying.\
 (paragraph 3) At 13, she had already flown an airplane. At age 16, Janet decided she wanted to try a free-fall parachute jump. In free-fall, the parachutist jumps out of a plane without opening the chute. After falling several hundred feet at more than 100 miles an hour, the cord is pulled to open the chute. Then, if all goes well, the parachutist floats safely to the ground.\
 (paragraph 4) Her father wouldn’t hear of it. “Absolutely not,” he said. “No free-fall!”\
 (paragraph 5) But Janet persisted. Finally, her father gave in. “Just one time,” he said, “but you have to be careful and do it the right way.”\
 (paragraph 6) He would allow her to jump only on two conditions: He would fly the plane and she would receive parachuting lessons before the jump.\
 (paragraph 7) Since there were no parachuting schools in South Florida at the time, Janet’s father hired a pro to give her private lessons. In her autobiography, Janet Guthrie—A Life at Full Throttle, Janet said the pro taught her how to pull the rip cord that opened the chute, how to absorb the shock after landing, and how to fasten the helmet so it wouldn’t fly off.\
 ♦ ♦ ♦\
 (paragraph 8) By the time she was 21, she had earned a commercial pilot’s license. She flew whenever she could break away from her classes at the University of Michigan.\
 (paragraph 9) After graduating, Guthrie got a job as a physicist in the aerospace industry. She saved her money for an entire year and bought a car. Guthrie wasn’t satisfied with just any car. She chose a Jaguar XK 120—the sleek and popular sports car that she had dreamed about since she was a teenager.\
 aerospace = a business involved with space flight\
 (paragraph 10) At first, Guthrie enjoyed just driving the car around Long Island, outside New York City. Then she heard about a local sports car club where members could compete. She loved her car and wanted to see how it would do on a track. Soon she was entering races—and winning them.\
 (paragraph 11) Excited by her success, Guthrie attended a driving school in Connecticut. She was a natural. Her instructor, veteran driver Gordon McKenzie, liked the way she handled her car. He suggested she try auto racing.\
 (paragraph 12) A thrill shot through Guthrie. What a great idea. Off she went to enroll in a racing car drivers’ school sponsored by the Sports Car Club of America. Guthrie swapped her Jaguar for a higher-priced model built especially for racing—the XK 140. Before long she taught herself how to take apart and rebuild its engine like a pro.\
 ♦ ♦ ♦\
 (paragraph 13) Guthrie’s career started to pick up speed.\
 (paragraph 14) She entered races all over the United States, finishing in some of the country’s most celebrated long-distance competitions. In 1973, she won the North Atlantic Road Racing Championship. A champion, yes, but a tired champion. By then she had been racing for 13 years. She was exhausted, broke, and thinking of leaving the sport.\
 (paragraph 15) That’s when she got the phone call. Someone named Vollstedt was asking her to drive his car in the 1976 Indy 500. No woman had ever driven in that race. This has to be a prank, thought Guthrie. But Vollstedt, an auto designer and builder from Oregon, wasn’t kidding. Could she drive a “championship” car? That was the big question.\
 (paragraph 16) With their open cockpits, wide wheelbases, and rear engines, championship cars were much different than the closed sports cars Guthrie had been accustomed to driving for many years.\
 (paragraph 17) “Before she would agree to drive for me,” Vollstedt said, “she wanted to see if she could handle the car.”\
 (paragraph 18) Vollstedt was wondering the same thing, too. He arranged for a secret test at the Ontario Motor Speedway near Los Angeles.\
 (paragraph 19) To get into top physical shape for Vollstedt’s test, Guthrie did exercises in front of her TV. One day she lost her balance, landed hard on her left foot, and fell to the floor. The doctors told her she had broken a bone and they put her foot in a heavy cast. How am I going to drive a racing car? she worried. Will I miss my big chance?\
 ♦ ♦ ♦\
 (paragraph 20) Broken ankle and all, Guthrie stepped into an unfamiliar car. She hit the accelerator. When her car got up to speed, Guthrie couldn’t believe the feeling. “What a thrill,” she said. “It was like going to the moon.”\
 (paragraph 21) Vollstedt was impressed with her time—an average speed of 178.52 miles per hour and a top speed of 196 mph.\
 (paragraph 22) Test passed.\
 (paragraph 23) She had showed Vollstedt she could drive the car. Now she had to show the rest of the world.\
Which quotation best reveals the author’s point of view?\
(A) “It was no surprise that Janet Guthrie excelled at one of the most dangerous sports on Earth.” (paragraph 1)\
 (B) “. . . the pro taught her how to pull the rip cord that opened the chute, how to absorb the shock after landing . . .” (paragraph 7)\
 (C) “She flew whenever she could break away from her classes at the University of Michigan.” (paragraph 8)\
 (D) “To get into top physical shape for Vollstedt’s test, Guthrie did exercises . . .” (paragraph 19)\

Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen – 1789\
 \
 Articles:\
 1. Men are born and remain free and equal in rights. Social distinctions may be founded only upon the general good.\
 \
 2. The aim of all political association is the preservation of the natural and imprescriptible [inalienable] rights of man. These rights are liberty, property, security, and resistance to oppression. . . .\
 \
 4. Liberty consists in the freedom to do everything which injures no one else; hence the exercise of the natural rights of each man has no limits except those which assure to the other members of the society the enjoyment of the same rights. These limits can only be determined by law. . . .\
 \
 6. Law is the expression of the general will. Every citizen has a right to participate personally, or through his representative, in its foundation. It must be the same for all, whether it protects or punishes. All citizens, being equal in the eyes of the law, are equally eligible to all dignities and to all public positions and occupations, according to their abilities, and without distinction except that of their virtues and talents. . . .\

 Declaration of the Rights of Woman and Female Citizen – 1791\
 \
 FIRST ARTICLE\
 Woman is born free and remains equal to man in rights. Social distinctions can only be founded on common service.\
 \
 II\
 The aim of all political associations is to preserve the natural and inalienable rights\
 of Woman and Man: these are the rights to liberty, ownership, safety and, above all, resistance to oppression. . . .\
 \
 IV\
 Liberty and justice lie in rendering everything which belongs to others as of right. Thus the exercise of woman’s natural rights has no limit other than the perpetual tyranny of man’s opposing them: these limits must be reformed by the laws of nature and reason. . . .\
 \
 VI\
 The Law must be the expression of the general will; all citizens, female and male, should concur [agree] personally or through their representatives in its formation, and it must be the same for all. All citizens, being equal in its eyes, must be equally eligible to all honours, positions and public posts according to their abilities, and with no other distinction other than those of their virtues and talents. . . .\

 Source : Olympe de Gouges, 1791\
Which political philosophy is best supported by both documents?\
(1) Rule of law represents a social contract with the people.\
 (2) Tyranny encourages liberty and security.\
 (3) Separation of powers guarantees people fair treatment.\
 (4) Oppression promotes the general will.\

 Mrs. Majeska and the Lost Gloves\
 \
 by Ethel Pochocki\
 \
 (paragraph 1) One crisp fall morning, Mrs. Majeska woke up with a craving for sauerkraut. It was so strong, she could smell it, she could taste it, and she knew she must have it for supper. So she put on her walking shoes, picked up her tub with a lid and a handle, and went into town to buy some.\
 \
 sauerkraut = chopped, pickled cabbage\
 \
  (paragraph 2) She walked briskly, enjoying the wind messing up her hair and the parade of dried leaves dancing ahead of her. It was a glorious day, and the thought of sauerkraut for supper, with a bit of apple and onion and sausage, made her want to dance along with the leaves.\
 \
 (paragraph 3) But suddenly she stopped. In the road there was a glove, a small black glove, the ﬁngers still plump, as if it had just left its owner’s hand. It was out of place in the middle of the road.\
 \
 (paragraph 4) Poor thing, thought Mrs. Majeska. I cannot leave it there. She picked it up quickly— a logging truck was coming—and laid it on the grass. She felt sorry for its owner, who now had only one glove. What good was one glove?\
 \
 (paragraph 5) On the way home from the store, she walked on the other side of the road, the sauerkraut sloshing inside the tub. A cluster of children came toward her, laughing and shouting to one another as they took turns kicking something in the dust. Finally they tired of it and ran off past Mrs. Majeska.\
 \
 (paragraph 6) She looked down at the sorry thing they had been kicking. It was another black glove, of the same size and shape as the one she had rescued. She examined it—yes, it was the mate to the other!\
 \
 (paragraph 7) Mrs. Majeska hesitated, then continued walking. It was only a glove, after all, not a child or a kitten or a wallet. Suddenly she stopped, turned around, and walked back to the crumpled bit of cloth. She picked it up, shook it out, and brushed off the dirt. It looked almost as good as new.\
 \
 (paragraph 8) With the glove in one hand and the tub of sauerkraut in the other, she strode down the road to where the other glove still lay in the grass. She placed its mate beside it, satisﬁed that they were now together. For what good was one glove without the other?\
 \
 (paragraph 9) A boy whizzed by on a bike and looked at her. Two old ladies, arm in arm, marched toward her on their way to the post ofﬁce. Mrs. Maj eska bent down and pretended to tie her Shoelaces, for she felt foolish to be caught in the act of reuniting a pair of gloves.\
 \
 (paragraph 10) That night, after a supper as delicious as she had imagined it, Mrs. Majeska sat in her rocker and thought about the gloves. She wished she had brought them home to use for herself. Their owner had probably already given them up for lost. The next morning,\
 after she had her coffee and read the newspaper, she decided to go back and get the gloves. But they were gone.\
 \
 (paragraph 11) Mrs. Majeska was mystiﬁed. Who—beside herself—would want a pair of gloves lying by the side of the road? Perhaps the owner had retraced her steps and rejoiced in ﬁnding them? Or maybe a housewife on a cleaning binge had used them to polish the stove? Or maybe a puppy needed something to chew on? Or a squirrel, to line its nest for winter?\
 \
 (paragraph 12) Mrs. Majeska would never know, but as long as she did not know, she would believe in a happy ending. No matter what their fate, the gloves were together, and that was all that mattered.\
Mrs. Majeska’s actions in paragraphs 7 and 8 most contribute to the development of the central idea by showing that she\
(A) is content that the gloves are back together\
 (B) considers taking the gloves home for herself\
 (C) thinks she is silly for worrying about the gloves\
 (D) cleans off the gloves to make them easy to ﬁnd\

Reading Comprehension Passage C\
 \
 …Nowhere is light pollution more apparent, almost achingly so, than in satellite images\
 of the Earth from space. The continental United States seems to split in half: the eastern\
 side is brighter than the west, except for the klieg lights of Las Vegas. Highways innervate (innervate - energize)\
 America, connecting luminous dots of small towns and big cities. Across the Atlantic,\
 (line 5) Europe shimmers. Moscow is a radiant nine-pointed star. The Nile Delta glows like a\
 dandelion sprouting from mostly indigo Africa. Farther east, Hong Kong and Shanghai are\
 ablaze, and the demilitarised zone separates dark North Korea from South Korea more\
 cleanly than if the peninsula had been cleft in two. Developed society, it’s clear, is where the\
 light is.\
 \
 (line 10) Human-controlled light has pierced the night for thousands of years, long before\
 [Thomas] Edison. Campfires warmed our ancestors’ feet and cooked their meals; the\
 Harvard anthropologist Richard Wrangham argues in his book Catching Fire (2009) that\
 gathering around a flame to eat and to commune with others is, in fact, what made us\
 human. Not just fellowship but safety has long been the primary rationale for pushing back\
 (line 15) the night. ‘Evil spirits love not the smell of lamps,’ as Plato put it. Comforting, lambent (lambent — glowing or flickering with a soft radiance) \
 lamplight led us safely home by tattling on the people and potholes and animals that would\
 otherwise do us harm. By the early 17th century, residents of cities such as Paris and London\
 were admonished (admonished — warned) to keep lights burning in the windows of all houses that faced the streets,\
 as the historian A. Roger Ekirch notes in his book At Day’s Close: Night in Times Past\
 (line 20) (2005). Taxpayers funded oil lamps and candlelit lanterns for the avenues, while only\
 genteel households could afford fine beeswax or spermaceti candles; most people relied on\
 tallow, made from animal fat. …\
 \
 And even so — what price safety! A young but rapidly growing field of research suggests\
 that night-time light itself is far more dangerous than the dark. In a 2012 report, an\
 (line 25) American Medical Association committee called electric lighting a ‘man-made self-\
 experiment’ creating potentially harmful health effects. Humans, and everything else that\
 lives on this planet with us, evolved during billions of years along a reliable cycle of day and\
 night, with clear boundaries between them. Staunching the flood of artificial light can help\
 restore this divide. Our well-being, and that of our fellow creatures, might depend on us\
 (line 30) doing so — or at the very least trying. The loss of night-time darkness neglects our shared\
 past, but it might very well cut short our futures too. …\
 \
 A growing body of evidence shows that light pollution exacerbates (exacerbates — makes a situation worse),  and might directly\
 cause, cancer, obesity, and depression, the troublesome triumvirate (triumvirate — a group of three holding power) of industrialised\
 society. One of the first people to notice this correlation, at least as it applies to cancer, is\
 (line 35) Richard Stevens, a professor at the University of Connecticut, respected cancer\
 epidemiologist (epidemiologist — health professional who investigates patterns and causes of diseases), and mild insomniac. In the early 1980s, Stevens and other researchers\
 were beginning to realise there was little or no connection between diet and rising rates \
 breast cancer, contrary to what had been suspected. As Stevens puts it, it was like a light\
 bulb going on when he realised that, in fact, a light bulb going on might be a culprit. …\
 \
 (line 40) ‘Rather than falling, night, to the watchful eye, rises,’ writes Ekirch in At Day’s Close.\
 Shadows creep up lows and valleys first, then consume hillsides and houses and the tallest\
 buildings. Muted greys and deeper blues chase off the sun until finally the sky leaks no\
 colour. When we sleep according to a solar cycle, melatonin (melantonin - hormone that regulates sleep and wakefulness) production follows this\
 pattern, rising with the night. But artificial light tamps it down. This is frustratingly\
 (line 45) apparent for a special class of humans who experience sunsets every 90 minutes: astronauts.\
 \
 One of the most frequent complaints of orbital crew members is insomnia; they pop\
 sleeping pills on a regular basis, and still get only about six hours of shuteye, though they’re\
 allotted eight. Steven W. Lockley, a Harvard neuroscientist, recommends altering the light\
 to improve matters. In 2012, he advised NASA [National Aeronautics and Space\
 (line 50) Administration] engineers to change the light bulbs on the International Space Station to a\
 type of LED that can display blue-shifted light during the ‘day’, when the crew is working,\
 and red-shifted light when they need to rest. Why the difference? That crucial ganglion (ganglion — mass of nerve tissues in the brain),\
 the circadian (circadian — 24-hour biological cycle) photoreceptor, is particularly sensitive to light toward the bluish end of the\
 red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo and violet visible-light spectrum. …\
 \
 (line 55) Insomnia is hardly the worst side effect of light pollution. Shift workers, who rise with\
 the night and work awash in blue light, experience not only disrupted circadian rhythms and\
 sleep deprivation, but an increased risk of breast and prostate cancer. These cancers, which\
 require hormones to grow, are suppressed in the presence of melatonin, Stevens has shown.\
 In 2010, Stevens published a review of breast cancer sensitivity in 164 countries, and found\
 (line 60) a 30 to 50 per cent increased risk of cancer in nations with the worst light pollution, but no\
 increased prevalence of non-hormonally dependent cancers in the same populations.\
 \
 ‘Our use of electric light in the modern world is disrupting our circadian sleep and our\
 biology. There is no question about that. Does that have physiological consequences? There\
 is more and more evidence that it does,’ Stevens told me. ‘The epidemiological studies are\
 (line 65) the crudest, but the most important.’ …\
 \
 When we, in the industrialised world, do manage to turn off the lights, there are\
 measurable, beneficial effects on our circadian rhythms. In a widely reported paper last\
 summer, Kenneth Wright at the University of Colorado at Boulder took eight students\
 camping in the Rocky Mountains for two weeks. They weren’t allowed to use any artificial\
 (line 70) light after the sun went down — only the sanguine (sanguine — red) glow of campfire. After a week,\
 melatonin started to rise at sunset, peak in the middle of the night, and taper just at sunrise,\
 which Wright called a ‘remarkable’ result. ‘Internal biological time under natural light-dark\
 conditions tightly synchronises to environmental time, and in this regard, humans are\
 comparable to other animals,’ he wrote. …\
 \
 (line 75) For those of us addicted to our glowing phones and tablets, an app called F.lux can help.\
 It ‘warms’ your device’s display screen so that it shifts red in the evening, more closely\
 matching incandescent bulbs and the hue of the setting sun. Just a brief glimpse at your\
 mobile phone at bedtime is enough to expose your retinas to artificial light, so fighting such\
 a comprehensive intrusion might be an exercise in futility. But even if we can’t completely\
 (line 80) quench our thirst for light, we can all make one small gesture, which could prompt us to\
 unplug a little more. …\

 Roche Moutonée\
 A roche moutonée is a glacial landscape feature produced as an advancing glacier slides over a hill of surface bedrock. As the glacier advances up the side of the hill, the surface bedrock is abraded and smoothed by rock fragments carried within the base of the glacial ice, creating a more gentle hillslope. As the glacier advances down the opposite side of the hill, chunks of bedrock are broken off and removed by the ice, a process called glacial quarrying (plucking), making this side of the hill steeper. The resulting hill resembles a drumlin, except it is often smaller and is composed of solid bedrock.\
A drumlin differs from a roche moutonée because a drumlin is\
(1) formed by glaciers\
 (2) dome shaped\
 (3) deposited by glacial meltwater\
 (4) composed of loose sediments\

 Excerpt from River of Dreams\
 \
 by Hudson Talbott\
 \
 (paragraph 1) By the twentieth century, New York City had long since reached its destiny of becoming the most powerful city in America. In less than 300 years it had grown from a tiny Dutch outpost in the wilderness to the business capital of the world. It was a city built on dreams.\
 \
 (paragraph 2) But it was made out of bricks and cement that had come from the banks of the Hudson. The river which had fed all those dreams was now fading into the background. New York didn’t seem to need the river anymore, except as a sewer. And that’s what it became.\
 \
 (paragraph 3) Industry on the river had made some New Yorkers filthy rich. But it had just made the river filthy. Garbage, factory waste, plant chemicals and the raw sewage of the cities and towns along its banks were dumped directly into the river. The water turned greenish brown, except by the GM plant, where it turned red or yellow or whatever color they were painting the cars that day.\
 \
 (paragraph 4) The fishing industry collapsed. The few fish that survived were too poisonous to eat. Smog from the factory smoke and dust from the cement plants blanketed the valley. And it was all legal.\
 \
 (paragraph 5) Most people don’t start out with dreams of polluting a river. But it was often the result of people chasing their dreams of wealth with little care of how they reached it. The Hudson Valley had always drawn them.\
 \
 (paragraph 6) But now there were other dreamers in the valley, with their own dreams of wealth. They dreamed of the wealth of wildlife in a healthy forest, the abundance of fish in oxygen-rich water, and the great fortune of living in a beautiful river valley.\
 \
 (paragraph 7) So perhaps it was a matter of time before the two types of dreamers would meet each other—in court.\
 \
 (paragraph 8) In 1963, Con Edison, New York City’s power company, proposed a plan for constructing the largest hydroelectric pumping station ever built. The plan called for carving out a gigantic hole in the side of majestic Storm King Mountain on the Hudson River.\
 \
 (paragraph 9) But then they met Franny Reese. Franny was a longtime valley resident with a simple point to make: the mountain could not speak for itself. If she didn’t speak for it, who would?\
 \
 (paragraph 10) Franny and a group of like-minded people founded Scenic Hudson and took on the power company in a landmark court case. Con Ed challenged the right of private citizens to participate, but the court sided with the citizens, in the ruling now known as the Scenic Hudson Decision.\
 \
 (paragraph 11) After dragging out the case for seventeen years, Con Ed finally gave up and Storm King survived unblemished. It was the beginning of the environmental movement in this country, and once again, the Hudson Valley was the birthplace.\
 \
 (paragraph 12) More and more people joined the movement as they realized how much difference each of us can make.\
 \
 (paragraph 13) The love of their land was still alive in the hearts of Americans, and now that it was aroused again, things began to change.\
 \
 (paragraph 14) Many new laws and new citizens’ groups have been inspired by those early heroes of the environment, and their work has begun to bring the Hudson back to life.\
 \
 (paragraph 15) The Mahicans called it “The River That Flows Both Ways.” Slowly we are learning that taking care of the river is the only way that the river can take care of us.\
 \
 (paragraph 16) Fifty years have passed since I dreamed of going to New York to see the river that shares my name, and thirty-five years since that dream came true. I live in the Hudson Valley now, grateful to all those who came before me, following their dreams to this river, building this nation, sharing its beauty, securing its future.\
 \
 (paragraph 17) It’s now my turn to help in keeping the river of dreams flowing, for all those dreamers yet to come.\
How does the idea expressed in paragraph 15 relate to the article?\
(A) There are two main ways that the river can be fixed.\
 (B) The river is able to move in two different directions.\
 (C) People who benefit from the river must also protect it.\
 (D) Opposing groups can each get what they want from the river.\

Reading Comprehension Passage C\
 \
 “The Russell-Einstein Manifesto,” signed by a group of eleven intellectuals and scientists including Bertrand Russell and Albert Einstein, was written at the height of the Cold War.\
 \
 In the tragic situation which confronts humanity, we feel that scientists should\
 assemble in conference to appraise the perils that have arisen as a result of the development\
 of weapons of mass destruction, and to discuss a resolution in the spirit of the appended\
 draft.\
 \
 (line 5) We are speaking on this occasion, not as members of this or that nation, continent, or\
 creed, but as human beings, members of the species Man, whose continued existence is in\
 doubt. The world is full of conflicts; and, overshadowing all minor conflicts, the titanic\
 struggle between Communism and anti-Communism. …\
 \
 We have to learn to think in a new way. We have to learn to ask ourselves, not what steps\
 (line 10) can be taken to give military victory to whatever group we prefer, for there no longer are\
 such steps; the question we have to ask ourselves is: what steps can be taken to prevent a\
 military contest of which the issue must be disastrous to all parties? …\
 \
 No doubt in an H-bomb (H-bomb — hydrogen bomb) war great cities would be obliterated. But this is one of the\
 minor disasters that would have to be faced. If everybody in London, New York, and\
 (line 15) Moscow were exterminated, the world might, in the course of a few centuries, recover from\
 the blow. But we now know, especially since the Bikini test, (Bikini test — reference to an American test of a hydrogen bomb conducted at the Bikini Atoll in the Pacific Ocean on March 1st, 1954. The bomb sent radioactive debris across the globe) that nuclear bombs can\
 gradually spread destruction over a very much wider area than had been supposed. …\
 \
 Many warnings have been uttered by eminent men of science and by authorities in\
 military strategy. None of them will say that the worst results are certain. What they do say\
 (line 20) is that these results are possible, and no one can be sure that they will not be realized. We\
 have not yet found that the views of experts on this question depend in any degree upon\
 their politics or prejudices. They depend only, so far as our researches have revealed, upon\
 the extent of the particular expert’s knowledge. We have found that the men who know most\
 are the most gloomy.\
 \
 (line 25) Here, then, is the problem which we present to you, stark and dreadful and inescapable:\
 Shall we put an end to the human race; or shall mankind renounce war? People will not face\
 this alternative because it is so difficult to abolish war.\
 \
 The abolition of war will demand distasteful limitations of national sovereignty. But\
 what perhaps impedes understanding of the situation more than anything else is that the\
 (line 30) term “mankind” feels vague and abstract. People scarcely realize in imagination that the\
 danger is to themselves and their children and their grandchildren, and not only to a dimly\
 apprehended humanity. They can scarcely bring themselves to grasp that they, individually,\
 and those whom they love are in imminent (imminent — about to take place) danger of perishing agonizingly. And so they\
 hope that perhaps war may be allowed to continue provided modern weapons are\
 (line 35) prohibited.\
 \
 This hope is illusory. Whatever agreements not to use H-bombs had been reached in\
 time of peace, they would no longer be considered binding in time of war, and both sides\
 would set to work to manufacture H-bombs as soon as war broke out, for, if one side\
 manufactured the bombs and the other did not, the side that manufactured them would\
 (line 40) inevitably be victorious.\
 \
 Although an agreement to renounce nuclear weapons as part of a general reduction of\
 armaments would not afford an ultimate solution, it would serve certain important purposes.\
 First: any agreement between East and West is to the good in so far as it tends to diminish\
 tension. Second: the abolition of thermo-nuclear weapons, if each side believed that the\
 (line 45) other had carried it out sincerely, would lessen the fear of a sudden attack in the style of\
 Pearl Harbour, which at present keeps both sides in a state of nervous apprehension. We\
 should, therefore, welcome such an agreement, though only as a first step.\
 \
 Most of us are not neutral in feeling, but, as human beings, we have to remember that,\
 if the issues between East and West are to be decided in any manner that can give any\
 (line 50) possible satisfaction to anybody, whether Communist or anti-Communist, whether Asian or\
 European or American, whether White or Black, then these issues must not be decided by\
 war. We should wish this to be understood, both in the East and in the West.\
 \
 There lies before us, if we choose, continual progress in happiness, knowledge, and\
 wisdom. Shall we, instead, choose death, because we cannot forget our quarrels? We\
 (line 55) appeal, as human beings, to human beings: Remember your humanity, and forget the rest.\
 If you can do so, the way lies open to a new Paradise; if you cannot, there lies before you\
 the risk of universal death.\
 \
 Resolution\
 \
 We invite this Congress, (Congress — the group of scientists who signed the Manifesto) and through it the scientists of the world and the general\
 public, to subscribe to the following resolution:\
 \
 (line 60) “In view of the fact that in any future world war nuclear weapons will certainly be\
 employed, and that such weapons threaten the continued existence of mankind, we urge\
 the Governments of the world to realize, and to acknowledge publicly, that their\
 purpose cannot be furthered by a world war, and we urge them, consequently, to find\
 peaceful means for the settlement of all matters of dispute between them.”\
 \
 —Bertrand Russell\
 excerpted from “The Russell–Einstein Manifesto”\
 July 9, 1955\
The Manifesto states that the presence of nuclear weapons requires individuals to\
(1) advocate for international conflict resolution\
 (2) elect politicians who will support disarmament\
 (3) participate in public discussions about the military\
 (4) prepare the communities for nuclear attack\

 Mrs. Majeska and the Lost Gloves\
 \
 by Ethel Pochocki\
 \
 (paragraph 1) One crisp fall morning, Mrs. Majeska woke up with a craving for sauerkraut. It was so strong, she could smell it, she could taste it, and she knew she must have it for supper. So she put on her walking shoes, picked up her tub with a lid and a handle, and went into town to buy some.\
 \
 sauerkraut = chopped, pickled cabbage\
 \
  (paragraph 2) She walked briskly, enjoying the wind messing up her hair and the parade of dried leaves dancing ahead of her. It was a glorious day, and the thought of sauerkraut for supper, with a bit of apple and onion and sausage, made her want to dance along with the leaves.\
 \
 (paragraph 3) But suddenly she stopped. In the road there was a glove, a small black glove, the ﬁngers still plump, as if it had just left its owner’s hand. It was out of place in the middle of the road.\
 \
 (paragraph 4) Poor thing, thought Mrs. Majeska. I cannot leave it there. She picked it up quickly— a logging truck was coming—and laid it on the grass. She felt sorry for its owner, who now had only one glove. What good was one glove?\
 \
 (paragraph 5) On the way home from the store, she walked on the other side of the road, the sauerkraut sloshing inside the tub. A cluster of children came toward her, laughing and shouting to one another as they took turns kicking something in the dust. Finally they tired of it and ran off past Mrs. Majeska.\
 \
 (paragraph 6) She looked down at the sorry thing they had been kicking. It was another black glove, of the same size and shape as the one she had rescued. She examined it—yes, it was the mate to the other!\
 \
 (paragraph 7) Mrs. Majeska hesitated, then continued walking. It was only a glove, after all, not a child or a kitten or a wallet. Suddenly she stopped, turned around, and walked back to the crumpled bit of cloth. She picked it up, shook it out, and brushed off the dirt. It looked almost as good as new.\
 \
 (paragraph 8) With the glove in one hand and the tub of sauerkraut in the other, she strode down the road to where the other glove still lay in the grass. She placed its mate beside it, satisﬁed that they were now together. For what good was one glove without the other?\
 \
 (paragraph 9) A boy whizzed by on a bike and looked at her. Two old ladies, arm in arm, marched toward her on their way to the post ofﬁce. Mrs. Maj eska bent down and pretended to tie her Shoelaces, for she felt foolish to be caught in the act of reuniting a pair of gloves.\
 \
 (paragraph 10) That night, after a supper as delicious as she had imagined it, Mrs. Majeska sat in her rocker and thought about the gloves. She wished she had brought them home to use for herself. Their owner had probably already given them up for lost. The next morning,\
 after she had her coffee and read the newspaper, she decided to go back and get the gloves. But they were gone.\
 \
 (paragraph 11) Mrs. Majeska was mystiﬁed. Who—beside herself—would want a pair of gloves lying by the side of the road? Perhaps the owner had retraced her steps and rejoiced in ﬁnding them? Or maybe a housewife on a cleaning binge had used them to polish the stove? Or maybe a puppy needed something to chew on? Or a squirrel, to line its nest for winter?\
 \
 (paragraph 12) Mrs. Majeska would never know, but as long as she did not know, she would believe in a happy ending. No matter what their fate, the gloves were together, and that was all that mattered.\
In paragraph 2, what does the phrase “made her want to dance along with the leaves” most suggest about Mrs. Majeska?\
(A) She is ready to move along quickly to get home.\
 (B) She remembers the words to a song in her head.\
 (C) She likes the fall weather because it causes change.\
 (D) She is happy because she is enjoying her day.\

 This is the true story of a Kenyan woman named Wangari Maathai.\
 Excerpt from Seeds of Change:\
 Planting a Path to Peace\
 by Jen Cullerton Johnson\
 \
 (paragraph 1) “Come,” Wangari’s mother called. She beckoned her young daughter over to a tall tree with a wide, smooth trunk and a crown of green, oval leaves.\
 \
 (paragraph 2) “Feel,” her mother whispered.\
 \
 (paragraph 3) Wangari spread her small hands over the tree’s trunk. She smoothed her fingers over the rough bark.\
 \
 (paragraph 4) “This is the mugumo,” her mother said. “It is home to many. It feeds many too.”\
 \
 (paragraph 5) She snapped off a wild fig from a low branch, and gave it to her daughter. Wangari ate the delicious fruit, just as geckos and elephants did. High in the tree, birds chirped in their nests. The branches bounced with jumping monkeys.\
 \
 (paragraph 6) “Our people, the Kikuyu of Kenya, believe that our ancestors rest in the tree’s shade,” her mother explained.\
 \
 (paragraph 7) Wangari wrapped her arms around the trunk as if hugging her great-grandmother’s spirit. She promised never to cut down the tree. . . .\
 \
 ((paragraph 8) When Wangari finished elementary school, she was eleven years old. Her mind was like a seed rooted in rich soil, ready to grow. Wangari wanted to continue her education, but to do so she would have to leave her village and move to the capital city of Nairobi. Wangari had never been farther than her valley’s ridge. She was scared.\
 \
 (paragraph 9) “Go,” her mother said. She picked up a handful of earth and placed it gently into her daughter’s hand. “Where you go, we go.” . . .\
 \
 (paragraph 10) As graduation neared, Wangari told her friends she wanted to become a biologist.\
 \
 (paragraph 11) “Not many native women become biologists,” they told her.\
 \
 (paragraph 12) “I will,” she said.\
 \
 (paragraph 13) Wangari watched sadly as her government sold more and more land to big companies that cut down forests for timber and to clear land for coffee plantations. Native trees such as cedar and acacia vanished. Without trees, birds had no place to nest. Monkeys lost their swings. Tired mothers walked miles for firewood. . . .\
 \
 (paragraph 14) When Wangari visited her village she saw that the Kikuyu custom of not chopping down the mugumo trees had been lost. No longer held in place by tree roots, the soil streamed into the rivers. The water that had been used to grow maize, bananas, and sweet potatoes turned to mud and dried up. Many families went hungry.\
 \
 (paragraph 15) Wangari could not bear to think of the land being destroyed. Now married and the mother of three children, she worried about what would happen to the mothers and children who depended on the land.\
 \
 (paragraph 16) “We must do something,” Wangari said.\
 \
 (paragraph 17) Wangari had an idea as small as a seed but as tall as a tree that reaches for the sky. “Harabee! Let’s work together!” she said to her countrywomen—mothers like her. Wangari dug deep into the soil, a seedling by her side. “We must plant trees.” . . .\
 \
 (paragraph 18) Wangari traveled to villages, towns, and cities with saplings and seeds, shovels and hoes. At each place she went, women planted rows of trees that looked like green belts across the land. Because of this they started calling themselves the Green Belt Movement.\
 \
 (paragraph 19) “We might not change the big world but we can change the landscape of the forest,” she said.\
 \
 (paragraph 20) One tree turned to ten, ten to one hundred, one hundred to one million, all the way up to thirty million planted trees. Kenya grew green again. Birds nested in new trees. Monkeys swung on branches. Rivers filled with clean water. Wild figs grew heavy in mugumo branches.\
 \
 (paragraph 21) Mothers fed their children maize, bananas, and sweet potatoes until they could eat no more.\
Read this sentence from paragraph 8 of the article.\
 Her mind was like a seed rooted in rich soil, ready to grow.\
 What does the sentence help the reader to understand about Wangari?\
(A) She likes to think about plants.\
 (B) She wants to keep learning.\
 (C) She imagines ways to help others.\
 (D) She believes in working together.\

 Reading Comprehension Passage A\
 \
 Caramelo\
 \
    One would think now that she was living in Chicago, in the same city as her [favorite son] \
 Inocencio, the Grandmother would find happiness. But no, that wasn’t the case. The \
 Grandmother was meaner than ever. She was unhappy. And didn’t know she was unhappy, \
 the worst kind of unhappiness of all. As a result, everyone was in a hurry to find her a house\
 (line 5) of some sort. A bungalow, a duplex, a brownstone, an apartment. Something, anything, \
 because the Grandmother’s gloominess was the contagious kind, infecting every member of \
 the household as fiercely as the bubonic plague. \
    Because Baby [Inocencio’s brother] and Ninfa’s apartment had room to accommodate \
 a guest, it was understood the Grandmother would stay with them until she could find a \
 (line 10) house of her own. This had seemed all well and fine when the plans were made long-\
 distance with Uncle Baby shouting into the receiver that he insisted, that he and Ninfa \
 wouldn’t think of her staying anywhere else, that the girls were thrilled she was coming. But \
 now that she was actually sleeping in [granddaughter] Amor’s narrow bed with radios and \
 televisions chattering throughout the apartment, and doors and cupboards banging, and the \
 (line 15) stink of cigarettes soaking into everything, even her skin, and trucks rumbling past and \
 shaking the building like an earthquake, and sirens and car horns at all hours, well, it just \
 about drove her crazy; even the rowdy Chicago wind, a rough, moody brute who took one \
 look at you and laughed. …\
    All day and all night the expressway traffic whooshed past, keeping the Grandmother\
 (line 20) awake. She napped when she could, even when the apartment and its inhabitants jabbered \
 the loudest. She was tired all the time, and yet she had trouble sleeping, often waking once \
 or twice in the early morning, and in her sleeplessness, padding in her house slippers to the \
 living room, where the front windows looked out onto the lanes of traffic, the expressway \
 billboards, and the frighteningly grimy factories beyond. The trucks and cars, furious to get\
 (line 25) from here to there, never paused for a moment, the sound of the expressway almost not a \
 sound at all, but a roar like the voice of the sea trapped inside a shell. \
    She pressed her forehead against the cold glass and sighed. If the Grandmother had \
 consulted her feelings, she would’ve understood why it was taking her so long to buy a new \
 house and settle in Chicago, but she was not a woman given to reflection. She missed her\
 (line 30) old house too much and was too proud to admit she’d made a mistake. She couldn’t go \
 backward, could she? She was stuck, in the middle of nowhere it seemed, halfway between \
 here and where? \
    The Grandmother missed the routine of her mornings, her three-minute eggs and \
 bolillo (bolillo - crunchy roll) breakfasts. She missed rubbing her big toe along the octagon tiles of her bathroom \
 (line 35) floor. But most of all, she missed her own bed with its mattress sagging in the center, the \
 familiar scent and weight of her blankets, the way morning entered gradually from the left\
 as the sun climbed over the east courtyard wall, the one topped with a cockscomb (cockscomb -rooster’s crown with jagged edges) of glass \
 shards to keep out the thieves. Why do we get so used to waking up in a certain room? And \
 when we aren’t in our own bed and wake up in another, a terrible fear for a moment, like\
 (line 40) death.\
    There is nothing worse than being a houseguest for too long, especially when your host\
 is a relative. The Grandmother felt like a prisoner. She hated climbing up the three flights\
 of stairs, and always arrived clutching her heart, convinced she was having an attack, like\
 the one that killed Narciso [her husband]. Really, once she was upstairs, she couldn’t even\
 (line 45) bear the thought of coming back down. What a barbarity! …\
    To visit Chicago is one thing, to live there another. This was not the Chicago of her\
 vacations, where one is always escorted to the lake shore, to the gold coast, driven along the\
 winding lanes of traffic of Lake Shore Drive in the shadow of beautiful apartment buildings,\
 along State Street and Michigan Avenue to window-shop at least. And perhaps taken on an\
 (line 50) excursion on the lake. How is it she hadn’t noticed the expression of the citizens, not the\
 ones fluttering in and out of taxis, but the ones at bus stops, hopping like sparrows, shivering\
 and peering anxiously for the next bus, and those descending wearily into the filthy bowels\
 of the subway like the souls condemned to purgatory.(purgatory - place of suffering)\
    At first the Grandmother was thrilled by the restaurants and the big discount chains—\
 (line 55) but then the routine got to be too familiar. Saturdays in search of houses that were not to\
 her liking. Dark brick houses with small, squinty windows, gloomy apartments, or damp\
 little bungalows, everything somber and sad and not letting in enough light, and no\
 courtyards, a dank, (dank - damp) mean gangway, a small patch of thin grass called a garden, and maybe a\
 bald tree in front. This wasn’t what she had in mind.\
 (line 60)   And as the weeks and months passed, and she was still without a house, the rainy, cold\
 autumn weather began and only made her feel worse. There was the Chicago winter\
 coming that everyone had warned her about, and she was already so cold and miserable she\
 didn’t feel much like leaving her room, let alone the building. She blamed Ninfa, who kept\
 lowering the heat in order to save money. The Grandmother confined herself to bed,\
 (line 65) satisfied only when she was under several layers of blankets. …\
    But nothing, nothing in the Grandmother’s imagination prepared her for the horrors of\
 a Chicago winter. It was not the picturesque (picturesque - charming) season of Christmas, but the endless tundra\
 of January, February, and March. Daylight dimmed to a dull pewter. (pewter - gray) The sun a thick piece\
 of ice behind a dirty woolen sky. It was a cold like you can’t imagine, a barbarous thing, a\
 (line 70) knife in the bone, a cold so cold it burned the lungs if one could even believe such a cold.\
 And the mountains of filthy snow shoveled in huge heaps, the chunks of ice on the sidewalk\
 that could kill an aged citizen. —Oh, this is nothing, you should’ve been here for the Big\
 Snow, the grandchildren bragged, speaking of the recent storm of ’68.\
    Big snow or little snow, it was all the same after the novelty of snow had worn off. A\
 (line 75) nuisance, a deadly thing, an exaggerated, long, drawn-out ordeal that made one feel like\
 dying, that killed one slowly, a torture. Let me die in February, let me die rather than have\
 to step out the door again, please, the Grandmother thought to herself, dreading having to\
 dress like a monster to go outside. —Ay, ya no puedo. I can’t anymore, I can’t. And just\
 when she could no longer, when she could no longer find the strength, the drive, the will to\
 (line 80) keep on living, when she was ready to fold into herself and let her spirit die, just then, and\
 only then, did April arrive with sky the color of hope and branches filled with possibilities.\

Base your answers to questions 36 through 38 on the passage and mineral table below and on your knowledge of Earth science. The table shows some properties of four minerals that display fluorescence.\
 \
 Fluorescent Minerals\
 All minerals have the ability to reflect visible light. Only about 15% of minerals have an interesting physical property known as fluorescence. These minerals have the ability to temporarily absorb a small amount of electromagnetic energy and, an instant later, release a small amount of energy of a different wavelength. This change in wavelength causes a temporary color change of the mineral in the eye of an observer. The color change of fluorescent minerals is most spectacular when the minerals are placed in darkness and exposed to electromagnetic energy shorter than visible light.\
 \
 A former zinc mine in New Jersey is one of the most famous sources of fluorescent minerals in the entire world. Zincite and willemite were two of the zinc ores mined there. It was later discovered that more than 91 minerals in this region displayed fluorescence under shortwave electromagnetic energy.\
 \
 Mineral | Hardness | Color Under Visible Light | “Fluorescent” Color | Composition\
 Calcite | 3 | clear-white-variable | bright orange | CaCO3\
 Celestine | 3 to 3.5 | colorless-variable | yellow and/or white/blue | SrSO4\
 Willemite | 5.5 | pink-tan | bright green | Zn2SiO4\
 Zincite | 4 | yellow-orange | yellow | ZnO\
Which two forms of electromagnetic energy are used to produce the most spectacular fluorescence when placed in darkness?\
(1) microwaves and x rays\
 (2) microwaves and infrared\
 (3) ultraviolet and x rays\

 \
 …Ivory and slaves had been the Congo’s main exports, but Leopold focused on rubber. The mass marketing of bicycles and automobiles in the 1890s greatly increased the demand for rubber and sent prices soaring. When a rubber producing vine was discovered in the rainforests of Congo in 1890, Leopold forced out the competition and acquired a monopoly on the scarce commodity. By one estimate, the Congo was producing 20,000 tons of crude rubber a year at a 900 percent profit. The high return was due largely to cheap labor.…\

 Excerpt from The Woolly-Puff Rescue\
 \
 by Sue Mozena\
 \
 (paragraph 1) Wendy and Alex stared at the strange ﬂower at their feet. Dozens of them bloomed in this remote corner of the ﬁeld.\
 \
 (paragraph 2) Wendy bent down for a closer look. “We shouldn’t name them until we’re sure we can keep them,” she warned. “But I like Woolly-Puffs. They look just like ﬂeecy rainbows.”\
 \
 (paragraph 3) As tempting as it was to pet the feathery yellow-orange-red-purple-blue petals, neither of them did. Instead, Wendy pulled protective gloves from her belt pack.\
 \
 (paragraph 4) On the asteroid-based colony of New Harmony, even twelve-year-old pioneers knew the number one rule for living in outer space: don’t touch or taste or sniff anything that hasn’t been tested.\
 \
 (paragraph 5) “Where do you think they came from?” Wendy asked. With a gentle tug, she freed a Woolly-Puff from the thin layer of soil, sealed it in a clear bag.\
 \
 (paragraph 6) “They were probably in the compost shipment that brought these naggers,” Alex muttered. He slapped at one of the whining insects that swarmed around him looking for exposed skin to bite.\
 \
 compost = a mixture of decaying plants used to improve the soil in a garden\
 \
 (paragraph 7) New Harmony depended on shipments of rich compost from nearby planets to build up its soil. Usually the compost was treated before it arrived, but one shipment had been accidentally overlooked. The whining gnat-like insects the colonists called “naggers” had hatched from the compost. Without any natural enemies in this new world, the insects had multiplied, becoming a constant torment to the colonists.\
 \
 (paragraph 8) After turning in their discovery, Wendy settled on a stone bench in front of the New Harmony laboratory. Alex paced, then sat. “Poor Woolly-Puff,” Wendy said. “What if it’s just a weedy ﬂower?”\
 \
 (paragraph 9) “Then one living plant and a packet of seeds will be sent to the Botany Preserve on Mars,” Alex answered, rubbing a hot-pink nagger welt just above his elbow.\
 \
 (paragraph 10) Wendy gingerly held the extra bouquet she had picked, in case the Woolly-Puffs proved keepers. “And the rest of the plants—”\
 \
 (paragraph 11) “The rest will be pulled up and destroyed to make room for ‘useful’ plants,” Alex said.\
 \
 (paragraph 12) The colony of New Harmony did have ﬂowers. It just didn’t have a lot of room. Woolly-Puffs would have to be more than pretty if they wanted to grow here.\
 \
 (paragraph 13) The two friends scrambled to attention as the lab door opened.\
 \
 (paragraph 14) “Your Woolly-Puff isn’t toxic,” Professor Raglin said. His smile faded as he went on. “The sap is thick and sticky, but we already have a good glue. The stems are too woody and the leaves too bristly to eat. And the petals, well, they smell funny. Not ﬂowery at all. More like moldy lemons. I’m sorry, but I’ll have to make my report to the council this afternoon. The good news is that they seem to grow only in the soil where you found them, so it won’t be hard to get rid of them.”\
 \
 (paragraph 15) “At least they’re not poison,” Wendy said after Professor Raglin had left. She hugged her colorful, fuzzy bouquet. She had to admit they did smell funny. “Mayor Murphy will probably send a reclaim crew out after the council meeting.” She sighed. “I wish the council would let us adopt one, like a pet.”\
 \
 (paragraph 16) “Fat chance,” Alex said. He blew at a pair of naggers trying to land on his knee. “Shoo! For harmless gnats, these bugs sure are pests.”\
 \
 (paragraph 17) “Yeah.” Wendy reached up to scratch the end of her nose. Then she realized something. The end of her nose itched simply because that’s what the ends of noses do sometimes. The naggers weren’t biting her. They weren’t even landing on her.\
 \
 (paragraph 18) “We’re going to the council meeting,” she announced.\
 \
 (paragraph 19) That afternoon, when the council members emerged from the community center, Alex and Wendy were waiting.\
 \
 (paragraph 20) “What is the meaning of this?” Mayor Murphy demanded as Alex and Wendy presented each member of the council with a Woolly-Puff garland.\
 \
 (paragraph 21) Glancing at Alex for courage, Wendy said, “Woolly-Puffs are bug chasers.”\
 \
 (paragraph 22) “Sorry,” Mayor Murphy said ﬁrmly. “We have already made our decision.”\
 \
 (paragraph 23) “Just watch,” Wendy pleaded. “Watch the naggers.”\
 \
 (paragraph 24) Then someone said, “What naggers? I don’t see any.”\
 \
 (paragraph 25) “Where are the naggers?” asked Professor Raglin. “It’s as if they’re avoiding us.”\
 \
 (paragraph 26) Wendy smiled. “They are. Naggers don’t like Woolly-Puffs.”\
 \
 (paragraph 27) So the Woolly-Puffs stayed in the vases and ﬂower boxes and gardens of New Harmony because, of course, they weren’t just pretty. They smelled like moldy lemons. And luckily, naggers couldn’t stand the smell of moldy lemons.\

 Mrs. Majeska and the Lost Gloves\
 \
 by Ethel Pochocki\
 \
 (paragraph 1) One crisp fall morning, Mrs. Majeska woke up with a craving for sauerkraut. It was so strong, she could smell it, she could taste it, and she knew she must have it for supper. So she put on her walking shoes, picked up her tub with a lid and a handle, and went into town to buy some.\
 \
 sauerkraut = chopped, pickled cabbage\
 \
  (paragraph 2) She walked briskly, enjoying the wind messing up her hair and the parade of dried leaves dancing ahead of her. It was a glorious day, and the thought of sauerkraut for supper, with a bit of apple and onion and sausage, made her want to dance along with the leaves.\
 \
 (paragraph 3) But suddenly she stopped. In the road there was a glove, a small black glove, the ﬁngers still plump, as if it had just left its owner’s hand. It was out of place in the middle of the road.\
 \
 (paragraph 4) Poor thing, thought Mrs. Majeska. I cannot leave it there. She picked it up quickly— a logging truck was coming—and laid it on the grass. She felt sorry for its owner, who now had only one glove. What good was one glove?\
 \
 (paragraph 5) On the way home from the store, she walked on the other side of the road, the sauerkraut sloshing inside the tub. A cluster of children came toward her, laughing and shouting to one another as they took turns kicking something in the dust. Finally they tired of it and ran off past Mrs. Majeska.\
 \
 (paragraph 6) She looked down at the sorry thing they had been kicking. It was another black glove, of the same size and shape as the one she had rescued. She examined it—yes, it was the mate to the other!\
 \
 (paragraph 7) Mrs. Majeska hesitated, then continued walking. It was only a glove, after all, not a child or a kitten or a wallet. Suddenly she stopped, turned around, and walked back to the crumpled bit of cloth. She picked it up, shook it out, and brushed off the dirt. It looked almost as good as new.\
 \
 (paragraph 8) With the glove in one hand and the tub of sauerkraut in the other, she strode down the road to where the other glove still lay in the grass. She placed its mate beside it, satisﬁed that they were now together. For what good was one glove without the other?\
 \
 (paragraph 9) A boy whizzed by on a bike and looked at her. Two old ladies, arm in arm, marched toward her on their way to the post ofﬁce. Mrs. Maj eska bent down and pretended to tie her Shoelaces, for she felt foolish to be caught in the act of reuniting a pair of gloves.\
 \
 (paragraph 10) That night, after a supper as delicious as she had imagined it, Mrs. Majeska sat in her rocker and thought about the gloves. She wished she had brought them home to use for herself. Their owner had probably already given them up for lost. The next morning,\
 after she had her coffee and read the newspaper, she decided to go back and get the gloves. But they were gone.\
 \
 (paragraph 11) Mrs. Majeska was mystiﬁed. Who—beside herself—would want a pair of gloves lying by the side of the road? Perhaps the owner had retraced her steps and rejoiced in ﬁnding them? Or maybe a housewife on a cleaning binge had used them to polish the stove? Or maybe a puppy needed something to chew on? Or a squirrel, to line its nest for winter?\
 \
 (paragraph 12) Mrs. Majeska would never know, but as long as she did not know, she would believe in a happy ending. No matter what their fate, the gloves were together, and that was all that mattered.\
What can the reader infer about Mrs. Majeska in paragraph 9?\
(A) She is nervous that the gloves will not be found by their owner.\
 (B) She is concerned about what the boy and the two ladies think of her.\
 (C) She is scared by the boy who is riding on the bike.\
 (D) She is upset by the old ladies who walk past her.\

 \
 Excerpt from River of Dreams\
 \
 by Hudson Talbott\
 \
 (paragraph 1) By the twentieth century, New York City had long since reached its destiny of becoming the most powerful city in America. In less than 300 years it had grown from a tiny Dutch outpost in the wilderness to the business capital of the world. It was a city built on dreams.\
 \
 (paragraph 2) But it was made out of bricks and cement that had come from the banks of the Hudson. The river which had fed all those dreams was now fading into the background. New York didn’t seem to need the river anymore, except as a sewer. And that’s what it became.\
 \
 (paragraph 3) Industry on the river had made some New Yorkers filthy rich. But it had just made the river filthy. Garbage, factory waste, plant chemicals and the raw sewage of the cities and towns along its banks were dumped directly into the river. The water turned greenish brown, except by the GM plant, where it turned red or yellow or whatever color they were painting the cars that day.\
 \
 (paragraph 4) The fishing industry collapsed. The few fish that survived were too poisonous to eat. Smog from the factory smoke and dust from the cement plants blanketed the valley. And it was all legal.\
 \
 (paragraph 5) Most people don’t start out with dreams of polluting a river. But it was often the result of people chasing their dreams of wealth with little care of how they reached it. The Hudson Valley had always drawn them.\
 \
 (paragraph 6) But now there were other dreamers in the valley, with their own dreams of wealth. They dreamed of the wealth of wildlife in a healthy forest, the abundance of fish in oxygen-rich water, and the great fortune of living in a beautiful river valley.\
 \
 (paragraph 7) So perhaps it was a matter of time before the two types of dreamers would meet each other—in court.\
 \
 (paragraph 8) In 1963, Con Edison, New York City’s power company, proposed a plan for constructing the largest hydroelectric pumping station ever built. The plan called for carving out a gigantic hole in the side of majestic Storm King Mountain on the Hudson River.\
 \
 (paragraph 9) But then they met Franny Reese. Franny was a longtime valley resident with a simple point to make: the mountain could not speak for itself. If she didn’t speak for it, who would?\
 \
 (paragraph 10) Franny and a group of like-minded people founded Scenic Hudson and took on the power company in a landmark court case. Con Ed challenged the right of private citizens to participate, but the court sided with the citizens, in the ruling now known as the Scenic Hudson Decision.\
 \
 (paragraph 11) After dragging out the case for seventeen years, Con Ed finally gave up and Storm King survived unblemished. It was the beginning of the environmental movement in this country, and once again, the Hudson Valley was the birthplace.\
 \
 (paragraph 12) More and more people joined the movement as they realized how much difference each of us can make.\
 \
 (paragraph 13) The love of their land was still alive in the hearts of Americans, and now that it was aroused again, things began to change.\
 \
 (paragraph 14) Many new laws and new citizens’ groups have been inspired by those early heroes of the environment, and their work has begun to bring the Hudson back to life.\
 \
 (paragraph 15) The Mahicans called it “The River That Flows Both Ways.” Slowly we are learning that taking care of the river is the only way that the river can take care of us.\
 \
 (paragraph 16) Fifty years have passed since I dreamed of going to New York to see the river that shares my name, and thirty-five years since that dream came true. I live in the Hudson Valley now, grateful to all those who came before me, following their dreams to this river, building this nation, sharing its beauty, securing its future.\
 \
 (paragraph 17) It’s now my turn to help in keeping the river of dreams flowing, for all those dreamers yet to come.\
Which quotation best expresses the author’s point of view in the article?\
(A) “In less than 300 years it had grown from a tiny Dutch outpost in the wilderness to the business capital of the world.” (paragraph 1)\

Excerpt from A la Carte\
 \
 by Tanita S. Davis\
 \
 (paragraph 1) “Homework?” My mother mouths the word exaggeratedly, eyebrows raised, and I roll my eyes. Frowning, she points with her chin to the side door that leads to the stairs. I roll my eyes again, mouthing, Okay, okay, not needing her to pantomime further what she wants me to do. I hate the thought of leaving the clattering nerve center of the restaurant to wrestle with my trigonometry homework in my mother’s quiet office downstairs.\
 \
 (paragraph 2) “Order!”\
 \
 (paragraph 3) The bright lights and swirl of noise and motion are muffled as the kitchen door swings closed behind me.\
 \
 (paragraph 4) It’s hard to remember a time when the restaurant hasn’t been the center of our lives. Mom used to be a copy editor and wrote food features for our local paper, the Clarion, and she met Pia when she did a write-up on the culinary school Pia attended. Pia thinks it was fate that Mom wanted to invest in a restaurant at the same time Pia wanted to buy the old bank building.\
 \
 (paragraph 5) La Salle Rouge doesn’t serve much in the way of “kid” food, since the menu doesn’t cater to people my age on a cheap date, but I’ve loved everything about it from the first. I started experimenting with being a vegetarian when I turned fourteen, but Pia still found things to feed me and taught me to be creative with vegetables and tofu. I like to think I’m the best-fed vegetarian in the state of California.\
 \
 (paragraph 6) Pia’s been really good about teaching what she knows, and I decided early on that this is the work I want to do—get out of school and get into the kitchen for good. Mom and Pia have created a popular French-Asian-Californian fusion restaurant that has gotten great reviews from food critics. They took the best of each other’s tastes—Mom’s traditional Southern flavors and Pia’s French training combined with her vegetable- and spice-savvy Cambodian tastes—and pulled off what one food critic called “stylized food with unique flavor combinations in an intimate setting.”\
 \
 (paragraph 7) Whatever that means.\
 \
 (paragraph 8) Three years ago, when I started high school thirty pounds heavier than everyone in my class, Mom and I came up with a light menu for La Salle Rouge, and it’s been such a popular idea that Mom lets me come up with tasty, low-calorie desserts, which is one of my favorite things to do. It hardly seems fair that I have to walk away from all of that just to do trigonometry, but my mom says I have to finish school before I concentrate on cooking. She says it’s smarter to have a “backup plan,” and she’s made me apply to plenty of colleges and check out business majors just in case I ever want to do anything else with my life. I guess that makes sense if you’re anybody other than me. When I turn eighteen, I already know what I’m going to do.\
 \
 (paragraph 9) First, I’m going to buy a plane ticket to D.C. and go to Julia Child’s kitchen at the Smithsonian and leave roses. They don’t let you walk through it, but somewhere—I don’t know where—I’m going to leave a bouquet and a little note for her. Julia Child is my patron saint. (patron saint - an inspiring person admired for his or her work) She’s the queen of all reasons people can do anything they want in life. Saint Julia didn’t start cooking until she was practically forty, and she went on to do TV shows and make cookbooks and be this huge part of culinary history. She never got too fancy, she never freaked out, and she was never afraid to try new things. I want to be just like her—except maybe get famous faster.\
 \
 (paragraph 10) The second thing I’m going to do is buy myself a set of knives. Pia swears by this set of German steel knives she got when she graduated, but I’ve seen the TV chef Kylie Kwong use a phenomenal-looking ceramic knife on her show on the Discovery Channel. Either way, knives are what the best chefs have of their very own.\
 \
 (paragraph 11) The third thing I’m going to do, after I get back from Washington and get my knives, is . . . get discovered. Somehow. I know I’m going to have to pay my dues, but I’m so ready for my real life to start. It’s not something I admit to a lot, but my real dream is to be a celebrity chef. Do you know how many African American female chefs there aren’t? And how many vegetarian chefs have their own shows? The field is wide open for stardom. Every time I watch old episodes of Saint Julia, I imagine that I have my own cooking show. The way celebrity chefs do it now, I could also have a line of cooking gear, cookbooks, aprons, the works. People would know my name, ask for my autograph, and try my recipes. All I have to do is finish my trig homework and get back into the kitchen.\
What does the statement “I know I’m going to have to pay my dues” (paragraph 11) show about the narrator’s attitude toward her plans?\
(A) She thinks the price of fame might be too high.\
 (B) She realizes success depends on more than setting a goal.\
 (C) She is highly motivated by the idea of becoming famous.\
 (D) She thinks becoming a celebrity chef requires only money.\

Excerpt from Gregor and the Sheep\
 by Toby Rosenstrauch\
 \
 (paragraph 1) In a valley in the highlands of Scotland, there once lived a young tenant farmer, Gregor, and his widowed mother. Although they worked hard, they could never accumulate enough money to buy the flock of sheep they longed to have, for their small parcel of land produced only modest amounts of oats and barley. To make matters worse, MacTavish, the owner of this and many other crofts, always found reasons not to pay the farmers all they had earned. . . .\
 \
 crofts = small farms\
 \
 (paragraph 2) When he opened the door each morning and looked out, he saw MacTavish’s house on top of a mountain, a magnificent stone mansion surrounded by red, pink, and violet rhododendrons. Gregor often climbed the slope and stood outside the iron gates, wondering what fine furnishings and delicious foods lay within. Neighbors claimed that MacTavish owned many houses and even kept a chest of gems under his bed. As Gregor, his mother, and their neighbors grew gaunt and pale with hard work and not enough food, they railed against MacTavish, who had swindled all of them at one time or another.\
 \
 swindled = cheated or tricked\
 \
 (paragraph 3) One day, as Gregor listened to the bagpipe music that drifted from the open windows of MacTavish’s mansion, he had an idea. That night, when his mother was asleep, he emptied the jug that held their money and counted it. After putting back a few coins for food, he put the rest in his pocket. The next morning, he hurried to the market, where he went from farmer to farmer, asking the prices of sheep for sale. Gregor found many handsome animals, but they were all too expensive. When he reached a stall with scrawny and sickly sheep, the owner beckoned to him. . . .\
 \
 (paragraph 4) Gregor shook his head and began to walk away. The man grabbed his sleeve and whispered in his ear, “This one will make her owner rich!” Gregor examined the old sheep with spindly legs and dirty, unkempt wool—the worst of the lot. “If she will make me rich,” said Gregor, “how is it that she has not done so for you?”\
 \
 (paragraph 5) The man paused, thinking. “I have not had her long enough!”\
 \
 (paragraph 6) “Nonsense,” said Gregor, but he gave the man his money and led the pitiful animal home.\
 \
 (paragraph 7) When his mother saw what he had bought with their money, she burst into tears. “My foolish son, what have you done? Now we will starve, and no one will help us!”\
 \
 (paragraph 8) “Do as I say, Mother, and we will be rich. I promise.”\
 \
 (paragraph 9) She wanted to believe him. Wiping her eyes with her ragged sleeve, she asked what he wanted her to do.\
 \
 (paragraph 10) “Go to market and tell everyone that your son has a sheep that will make whoever owns her rich,” said Gregor. . . .\
 \
 (paragraph 11) One morning, a carriage arrived. Two servants opened the door and a stout, welldressed gentleman emerged. His Tartan kilt was made of the finest wool, his ascot was pure silk, and his shoes had silver buckles. On his fat fingers were eight gold rings, and his pomaded hair glistened in the sun. It was MacTavish!\
 \
 Tartan kilt = traditional clothing worn by Scottish Highlanders\
 \
 ascot = a type of necktie\
 \
 (paragraph 12) Gregor bowed as if to royalty. MacTavish looked at him sternly. “I have come to rid you of the unfortunate sheep that everyone is talking about,” said MacTavish, opening his sporran. “I can pay your price and I will have her, even though she has done nothing for you, I see.” MacTavish sneered at Gregor.\
 \
 sporran = a small bag worn at the waist for holding personal items\
 \
 (paragraph 13) Gregor hugged Dear One. “I will not sell her to you!”\
 \
 (paragraph 14) ”At that, MacTavish, whose servants were helping him into his carriage, turned and marched back. “I will pay anything,” he said. “Name the price.”\
 \
 (paragraph 15) Gregor was ready. “That,” he said, pointing up to the mansion above them. “I will have the dwelling and everything in it—furniture, utensils, even the chest of gems under your bed.”\
 \
 (paragraph 16) “Done,” said MacTavish.\
 \
 (paragraph 17) The next day, Gregor and his mother moved into the mansion that had once belonged to MacTavish, and MacTavish brought Dear One to the market so that all might see he could indeed own anything he wanted. Then MacTavish and the sheep rode away in his carriage to another of his houses in a valley beyond the mountains.\
 \
 (paragraph 18) After months had passed and the sheep had done nothing to increase MacTavish’s riches, he realized he had been swindled. Furious beyond speech, he returned to the mansion, but Gregor would not open the gates.\
 \
 (paragraph 19) “I have been cheated!” shouted MacTavish.\
 \
 (paragraph 20) “You have not been cheated,” said Gregor. “I was the owner of the sheep, and she has made me rich, hasn’t she?”\
 \
 (paragraph 21) “Yes, but . . . ,” sputtered MacTavish.\
 \
 (paragraph 22) “Then you got what you paid for.” Gregor turned and walked away.\
 \
 (paragraph 23) Soon afterward, Gregor sold the chest of gems and bought the huge flock of sheep he and his mother had always wanted. He shared the rest of his fortune with the other poor families of the valley who had been cheated by MacTavish.\

Reading Comprehension Passage C\
 \
 “The Russell-Einstein Manifesto,” signed by a group of eleven intellectuals and scientists including Bertrand Russell and Albert Einstein, was written at the height of the Cold War.\
 \
 In the tragic situation which confronts humanity, we feel that scientists should\
 assemble in conference to appraise the perils that have arisen as a result of the development\
 of weapons of mass destruction, and to discuss a resolution in the spirit of the appended\
 draft.\
 \
 (line 5) We are speaking on this occasion, not as members of this or that nation, continent, or\
 creed, but as human beings, members of the species Man, whose continued existence is in\
 doubt. The world is full of conflicts; and, overshadowing all minor conflicts, the titanic\
 struggle between Communism and anti-Communism. …\
 \
 We have to learn to think in a new way. We have to learn to ask ourselves, not what steps\
 (line 10) can be taken to give military victory to whatever group we prefer, for there no longer are\
 such steps; the question we have to ask ourselves is: what steps can be taken to prevent a\
 military contest of which the issue must be disastrous to all parties? …\
 \
 No doubt in an H-bomb (H-bomb — hydrogen bomb) war great cities would be obliterated. But this is one of the\
 minor disasters that would have to be faced. If everybody in London, New York, and\
 (line 15) Moscow were exterminated, the world might, in the course of a few centuries, recover from\
 the blow. But we now know, especially since the Bikini test, (Bikini test — reference to an American test of a hydrogen bomb conducted at the Bikini Atoll in the Pacific Ocean on March 1st, 1954. The bomb sent radioactive debris across the globe) that nuclear bombs can\
 gradually spread destruction over a very much wider area than had been supposed. …\
 \
 Many warnings have been uttered by eminent men of science and by authorities in\
 military strategy. None of them will say that the worst results are certain. What they do say\
 (line 20) is that these results are possible, and no one can be sure that they will not be realized. We\
 have not yet found that the views of experts on this question depend in any degree upon\
 their politics or prejudices. They depend only, so far as our researches have revealed, upon\
 the extent of the particular expert’s knowledge. We have found that the men who know most\
 are the most gloomy.\
 \
 (line 25) Here, then, is the problem which we present to you, stark and dreadful and inescapable:\
 Shall we put an end to the human race; or shall mankind renounce war? People will not face\
 this alternative because it is so difficult to abolish war.\
 \
 The abolition of war will demand distasteful limitations of national sovereignty. But\
 what perhaps impedes understanding of the situation more than anything else is that the\
 (line 30) term “mankind” feels vague and abstract. People scarcely realize in imagination that the\
 danger is to themselves and their children and their grandchildren, and not only to a dimly\
 apprehended humanity. They can scarcely bring themselves to grasp that they, individually,\
 and those whom they love are in imminent (imminent — about to take place) danger of perishing agonizingly. And so they\
 hope that perhaps war may be allowed to continue provided modern weapons are\
 (line 35) prohibited.\
 \
 This hope is illusory. Whatever agreements not to use H-bombs had been reached in\
 time of peace, they would no longer be considered binding in time of war, and both sides\
 would set to work to manufacture H-bombs as soon as war broke out, for, if one side\
 manufactured the bombs and the other did not, the side that manufactured them would\
 (line 40) inevitably be victorious.\
 \
 Although an agreement to renounce nuclear weapons as part of a general reduction of\
 armaments would not afford an ultimate solution, it would serve certain important purposes.\
 First: any agreement between East and West is to the good in so far as it tends to diminish\
 tension. Second: the abolition of thermo-nuclear weapons, if each side believed that the\
 (line 45) other had carried it out sincerely, would lessen the fear of a sudden attack in the style of\
 Pearl Harbour, which at present keeps both sides in a state of nervous apprehension. We\
 should, therefore, welcome such an agreement, though only as a first step.\
 \
 Most of us are not neutral in feeling, but, as human beings, we have to remember that,\
 if the issues between East and West are to be decided in any manner that can give any\
 (line 50) possible satisfaction to anybody, whether Communist or anti-Communist, whether Asian or\
 European or American, whether White or Black, then these issues must not be decided by\
 war. We should wish this to be understood, both in the East and in the West.\
 \
 There lies before us, if we choose, continual progress in happiness, knowledge, and\
 wisdom. Shall we, instead, choose death, because we cannot forget our quarrels? We\
 (line 55) appeal, as human beings, to human beings: Remember your humanity, and forget the rest.\
 If you can do so, the way lies open to a new Paradise; if you cannot, there lies before you\
 the risk of universal death.\
 \
 Resolution\
 \
 We invite this Congress, (Congress — the group of scientists who signed the Manifesto) and through it the scientists of the world and the general\
 public, to subscribe to the following resolution:\
 \
 (line 60) “In view of the fact that in any future world war nuclear weapons will certainly be\
 employed, and that such weapons threaten the continued existence of mankind, we urge\
 the Governments of the world to realize, and to acknowledge publicly, that their\
 purpose cannot be furthered by a world war, and we urge them, consequently, to find\
 peaceful means for the settlement of all matters of dispute between them.”\
 \
 —Bertrand Russell\
 excerpted from “The Russell–Einstein Manifesto”\
 July 9, 1955\
The position taken in lines 9 through 12 suggests\
(1) a justification of modern warfare and politics\
 (2) a connection between military victory and the destruction of Communism\
 (3) the similarity of Communist and anti-Communist ideals\
 (4) the relationship between military conflict and ultimate disaster\

If you grew up in Ireland you were told about the Famine. It was dinned [pounded] into you. In the history books there were pictures of huddled families dying of hunger in their hovels [simple dwelling], the same families being evicted—by English landlords—and with no place to go but a ditch.\
 \
 In the 1930s and 1940s old people in Limerick City still whispered of the horrors of that Famine less than 100 years before. They said it was the fault of the English. They said it was a fact that tons of corn [grain] were shipped out of the country to feed Her Majesty’s armies beyond. There was enough food to go around to feed Ireland ten times over. \
 \
 The old people said they would never forgive that of the English and they hoped we wouldn’t either. . . .\

The First Public Park\
 by Marcia Amidon Lusted\
 \
 It was just an idea for more than a decade, but by 1857, New Yorkers were serious\
 about building a grand public park. New York was the largest metropolis in the nation,\
 and its citizens wanted to show the world that Americans were not just concerned about\
 industry, wealth, and materialism but that they also appreciated natural landscapes.\
 (line 5) Using eminent domain, the city took more than 840 acres of land in the center of\
 Manhattan for the new park. The area was considered to lack any real estate value—it\
 included swamps, bluffs, and rock outcroppings as well as two reservoirs that supplied city\
 water. It was home to about 1,600 poor residents, however. This population of pig farmers,\
 gardeners, and an African American settlement called Seneca Village was displaced by the\
 (line 10) park’s construction.\
 The Central Park Commission held a competition to choose someone to design the\
 park. Among the professional and amateur designers who entered the contest was a team\
 consisting of an American agriculturalist and a British-born architect: Frederick Law\
 Olmsted and Calvert Vaux.\
 (line 15) It was Vaux’s idea for the two men to join forces. A talented draftsman, Vaux used his\
 detailed drawings to show how their idea for the park would look. An accomplished\
 writer, Olmsted wrote the report that described their plan and included lists of proposed\
 plants and an estimated budget. They submitted their plan, called “Greensward,” a day\
 after the commission’s deadline.\
 (line 20) Greensward included pastoral views and rolling meadows, just like those in traditional\
 English parks. The plan offered beautiful vistas of green lawns and natural rocky ridges as\
 well as more formal locations for public gatherings.\
 It also included four roads that cut through the park to carry carriage traffic from one\
 side to the other. Olmsted and Vaux designed these major thoroughfares to run eight feet\
 (line 25) below the park’s surface so they would not disrupt the park’s views and rural feeling.\
 Pedestrian paths, equestrian roads, and carriage drives were all kept separate from one\
 another. Vaux designed more than 40 bridges so that these various paths would never have\
 to cross on the same level.\
 Unlike some of the other submissions that included grand, elaborate buildings,\
 (line 30) Olmsted and Vaux kept structures to a minimum, with only four in the original plan. The\
 design and materials for the buildings were also specifically selected to blend in with the\
 natural environment.\
 Greensward was announced the winner in the spring of 1858. The selection committee\
 debated over certain design points—some of the members wanted a wide grand avenue in\
 (line 35) the park, similar to those found in European parks. Olmsted argued against it by saying\
 that stately roads would “destroy scenery at great cost” and that “straight lines of trees or\
 stately architecture . . . belong not to parks for the people but to palatial gardens.” Olmsted\
 and Vaux had created their design for the recreation of all people, not just the wealthy.\
 The park was to be a place where all New Yorkers could enjoy nature. Its ultimate design\
 (line 40) would retain this feeling.\
 The construction of Central Park was one of the most massive public works projects\
 to take place in 19th-century New York. It required about 20,000 workers to reshape the\
 natural features of the land according to Olmsted and Vaux’s plan. Three hundred\
 thousand cubic yards of rock were blasted into rubble, and the resulting stone was crushed\
 (line 45) to use as paving material. Nearly three million cubic yards of soil were moved, and more\
 than 270,000 trees and shrubs were planted. Swamps were transformed into scenic lakes,\
 and extensive drainage work was done to get rid of small streams and pools. By 1866,\
 more than $5 million had been spent on construction. The park’s final price tag was more\
 than $10 million. In the end, this entirely planned park, stretching from 59th Street to\
 (line 50) 110th Street and from Fifth to Eighth avenues, had a completely natural, unplanned\
 feeling to it.\
 The process of overseeing the park’s construction and accounting for its expenditures\
 exhausted Olmsted. He required a six-week rest cure in Europe in 1859 and suffered a\
 severe broken leg in 1860 that laid him up, but he had the plans for the park spread out in\
 (line 55) his bedroom so he could continue to work. When he tried to resign from the project in\
 1861, however, the commission knew that it could not afford to lose him. Ultimately,\
 Olmsted’s duties and responsibilities were decreased, and when he departed the project to\
 serve in the U.S. Sanitary Commission during the Civil War (1861–1865), the park’s\
 construction was completed under park commission president Andrew Green and Vaux.\
 (line 60) Olmsted’s involvement in Central Park spanned nearly 20 years. It was not the only\
 site he worked or consulted on, and, for a couple of years, other projects demanded his\
 full attention. But from the time their plan was selected until the mid-1870s, Olmsted and\
 Vaux were associated with the park on and off. Sometimes, their titles as landscape\
 architect advisors required little on-site work. At other times, such as when Olmsted filled\
 (line 65) in as acting president of the Department of Public Parks, he looked into establishing lights\
 in the park at night and assessing the park’s safety. By 1878, however, Olmsted’s role with\
 the park officially ended.\
 Today, Central Park stands as one of Olmsted’s greatest legacies. It contains numerous\
 playgrounds and athletic fields. Runners and bicyclists make use of the wide, rolling paths.\
 (line 70) There are places to skate in the winter and boat in the summer. Concerts, plays, and rallies\
 take place there. Sculptures by famous artists can be found throughout the park. There are\
 also quiet places to walk, sit and read a book, or watch birds. Central Park has become a\
 world-famous site that attracts more than 25 million visitors each year. It also is a shining\
 example of Olmsted’s desire to create and preserve public green spaces in urban places for\
 (line 75) generations of people to enjoy.\
Which evidence supports the idea that Olmsted and Vaux wanted their park to appeal to all New Yorkers?\
(A) They excluded some designs common to European parks.\
 (B) They decided to put the park in the middle of Manhattan.\
 (C) They hired thousands of local residents to build the park.\
 (D) They included lights so the park could be used at night.\

 View with a Grain of Sand\
 \
 We call it a grain of sand\
 but it calls itself neither grain nor sand.\
 It does just fine without a name,\
 whether general, particular,\
 (line 5) permanent, passing,\
 incorrect or apt.\
 \
 Our glance, our touch mean nothing to it.\
 It doesn’t feel itself seen and touched.\
 And that it fell on the windowsill\
 (line 10) is only our experience, not its.\
 For it it’s no different than falling on anything else\
 with no assurance that it’s finished falling\
 or that it’s falling still.\
 \
 The window has a wonderful view of a lake\
 (line 15) but the view doesn’t view itself.\
 It exists in this world\
 colorless, shapeless,\
 soundless, odorless, and painless.\
 \
 The lake’s floor exists floorlessly\
 (line 20) and its shore exists shorelessly.\
 Its water feels itself neither wet nor dry\
 and its waves to themselves are neither singular nor plural.\
 They splash deaf to their own noise\
 on pebbles neither large nor small.\
 \
 (line 25) And all this beneath a sky by nature skyless\
 in which the sun sets without setting at all\
 and hides without hiding behind an unminding cloud.\
 The wind ruffles it, its only reason being\
 that it blows.\
 \
 (line 30) A second passes.\
 A second second.\
 A third.\
 But they’re three seconds only for us.\
 \
 Time has passed like a courier with urgent news.\
 (line 35) But that’s just our simile.\
 The character’s invented, his haste is make-believe,\
 his news inhuman.\

Reading Comprehension Passage A\
 \
 …It was so cold that his first breath turned to iron in his throat, the hairs in his nostrils\
 webbed into instant ice, his eyes stung and watered. In the faint starlight and the bluish\
 luminescence of the snow everything beyond a few yards away swam deceptive and without\
 depth, glimmering with things half seen or imagined. Beside the dead car he stood with his\
 (line 5) head bent, listening, and there was not a sound. Everything on the planet might have died\
 in the cold. …\
 \
 But here he stood in light overcoat and thin leather gloves, without overshoes, and his\
 car all but blocked the road, and the door could not be locked, and there was not a\
 possibility that he could carry the heavy cases with him to the next farm or village. He\
 (line 10) switched on the headlights again and studied the roadside they revealed, and saw a rail\
 fence, with cedars and spruces behind it. When more complex gadgets and more complex\
 cures failed, there was always the lucifer match (lucifer match — a match that ignites through friction).\
 \
 Ten minutes later he was sitting with the auto robe over his head and shoulders and his\
 back against the plowed snowbank, digging the half melted snow from inside his shoes and\
 (line 15) gloating over the growing light and warmth of the fire. He had a supply of fence rails good\
 for an hour. In that time, someone would come along and he could get a push or a tow. In\
 this country, in winter, no one ever passed up a stranded motorist. …\
 \
 Abruptly he did not want to wait in that lonely snow-banked ditch any longer. The\
 sample cases (sample cases — cases of medicine samples) could look after themselves, any motorist who passed could take his own\
 (line 20) chances. He would walk ahead to the nearest help, and if he found himself getting too cold\
 on the way, he could always build another fire. The thought of action cheered him; he\
 admitted to himself that he was all but terrified at the silence and the iron cold. …\
 \
 Turning with the road, he passed through the stretch of woods and came into the open\
 to see the moon-white, shadow-black buildings of a farm, and the weak bloom of light in a\
 (line 25) window. …\
 \
 “Hello?” he said, and knocked again. “Anybody home?” No sound answered him. He\
 saw the moon glint on the great icicles along the eaves. His numb hand ached with the pain\
 of knocking; he pounded with the soft edge of his fist.\
 \
 Answer finally came, not from the door before which he stood, but from the barn, down\
 (line 30) at the end of a staggered string of attached sheds. A door creaked open against a snowbank\
 and a figure with a lantern appeared, stood for a moment, and came running. The traveler\
 wondered at the way it came, lurching and stumbling in the uneven snow, until it arrived at\
 the porch and he saw that it was a boy of eleven or twelve. The boy set his lantern on the\
 porch; between the upturned collar of his mackinaw (mackinaw — type of warm coat) and the down-pulled stocking cap his\
 (line 35) face was a pinched whiteness, his eyes enormous. He stared at the traveler until the traveler\
 became aware of the blanket he still held over head and shoulders, and began to laugh.\
 \
 “My car stopped on me, a mile or so up the road,” he said. “I was just hunting a\
 telephone or some place where I could get help.”\
 \
 The boy swallowed, wiped the back of his mitt across his nose. “Grandpa’s sick!” he\
 (line 40) blurted, and opened the door. …\
 \
 “He must’ve had a shock,” the boy said. “I came in from chores and he was on the floor.”\
 He stared at the mummy under the quilt, and he swallowed. …\
 \
 “Why didn’t you go for help?”\
 \
 The boy looked down, ashamed. “It’s near two miles. I was afraid he’d.…”\
 \
 (line 45) “But you left him. You were out in the barn.”\
 \
 “I was hitching up to go,” the boy said. “I’d made up my mind.”\
 \
 The traveler backed away from the stove, his face smarting (smarting — stinging) with the heat, his fingers\
 and feet beginning to ache. He looked at the old man and knew that here, as at the car, he\
 was helpless. The boy’s thin anxious face told him how thoroughly his own emergency had\
 (line 50) been swallowed up in this other one. He had been altered from a man in need of help to\
 one who must give it. Salesman of wonder cures, he must now produce something to calm\
 this over-worried boy, restore a dying man. Rebelliously, victimized by circumstances, he\
 said, “Where were you going for help?”\
 \
 “The Hill place. They’ve got a phone.”\
 \
 (line 55) “How far are they from a town?”\
 \
 “About five miles.”\
 \
 “Doctor there?”\
 \
 “Yes.”\
 \
 “If I took your horse and—what is it, sleigh?—could someone at the Hills’ bring them\
 (line 60) back, do you think?”\
 \
 “Cutter (cutter — a small horse-drawn sled). One of the Hill boys could, I should say.”\
 \
 “Or would you rather go, while I look after your Grandpa?”\
 \
 “He don’t know you,” the boy said directly. “If he should wake up he might … wonder\
 … it might.…”\
 \
 (line 65) The traveler grudgingly gave up the prospect of staying in the warm kitchen while the\
 boy did the work. And he granted that it was extraordinarily sensitive of the boy to know\
 how it might disturb a man to wake from sickness in his own house and stare into the face\
 of an utter stranger. “Yes,” he said. “Well, I could call the doctor from the Hills’. Two miles,\
 did you say?” …\
 \
 (line 70) He climbed into the cutter and pulled over his lap the balding buffalo robe he found\
 there; the scallop (scallop — curve) of its felt edges was like a key that fitted a door. The horses breathed jets\
 of steam in the moonlight, restlessly moving, jingling their harness bells, as the moment\
 lengthened itself. The traveler saw how the boy, now that his anxiety was somewhat quieted,\
 now that he had been able to unload part of his burden, watched him with a thousand\
 (line 75) questions in his face, and he remembered how he himself, thirty years ago, had searched\
 the faces of passing strangers for something he could not name, how he had listened to their\
 steps and seen their shadows lengthen ahead of them down roads that led to unimaginable\
 places, and how he had ached with the desire to know them, who they were. But none of\
 them had looked back at him as he tried now to look at this boy. …\
 \
 (line 80) For half a breath he was utterly bewitched, frozen at the heart of some icy dream.\
 Abruptly he slapped the reins across the backs of the horses; the cutter jerked and then slid\
 smoothly out toward the road. The traveler looked back once, to fix forever the picture of\
 himself standing silently watching himself go. As he slid into the road the horses broke into\
 a trot. The icy flow of air locked his throat and made him let go the reins with one hand to\

 Along a road he had never driven he went swiftly toward an unknown farm and an\

 emergency and his own; but he bore (bore — carried) in his mind, bright as moonlight over snow, a vivid\

The loudness of sound is measured in units called decibels (dB). These units are measured by first assigning an intensity $I_{0}$ to a very soft sound that is called the threshold sound. The sound to be measured is assigned an intensity, $I$, and the decibel rating, $d$, of this sound is found using $d = 10log\frac{I}{I_{0}}$. The threshold sound audible to the average person is $1.0 * 10^{-12} W/m^{2}$ (watts per square meter).\
 \
 Consider the following sound level classifications:\
 \
 Moderate | 45-69 dB\
 Loud | 70-89 dB\
 Very loud | 90-109 dB\
 Deafening | >110 dB\
 \
 How would a sound with intensity $6.3 * 10^{-3} W/m^{2}$ be classified?\
(1) moderate\
 (2) loud\
 (3) very loud\
 (4) deafening\

 Excerpt from The Guest Cat\
 \
 by Takashi Hiraide\
 \
 (paragraph 1) The cat’s name was Chibi, which means “little one.” We could hear the boy’s particularly high-pitched voice calling the cat: “Chibi!” Then we’d hear the sound of the boy’s shoes running around outside, followed by the tinkling of the little bell announcing the cat’s arrival.\
 \
 (paragraph 2) Chibi was a jewel of a cat. Her pure white fur was mottled with several lampblack blotches containing just a bit of light brown. The sort of cat you might see just about anywhere in Japan, except she was especially slim and tiny.\
 \
 (paragraph 3) These were her individual characteristics—slim and small, with ears that stood out, tapering off beautifully at the tips, and often twitching. She would approach silently and undetected to rub up against one’s legs. At first I thought Chibi avoided me because I was not used to cats, but this seems not to have been the case. When a girl who often passed along Lightning Alley stopped and crouched to gaze at the cat, it did not run away. But as soon as she attempted to touch it, the cat quickly slipped off, avoiding contact at all costs. The cat’s manner of rejection was like cold, white light.\
 \
 (paragraph 4) Moreover, the cat rarely made a sound. As far as I remember, when it first appeared in the alley it made some sort of sound, but since then it had never let out a meow. It looked as if no matter how much time passed the cat was not going to let us hear its\
 voice. This seemed to be the message the cat was giving us.\
 \
 (paragraph 5) Another one of Chibi’s characteristics was that she changed the direction of her cautious attention frequently. This active behavior wasn’t limited to her kittenhood. Perhaps because she played alone most of the time in the expansive garden, she reacted strongly to insects and reptiles. And there were times when I could only conclude that she must be reacting to subtle changes in the wind and light, not detectable by humans. It may be that most cats share the same quickness, but even so, in Chibi’s case, it was acute—she was, after all, the cat of Lightning Alley. My wife got into the habit of pointing to the cat whenever it went by, extolling (extolling - praising) its virtues. . . .\
 \
 (paragraph 6) Chibi, who loved to play ball, gradually began to visit us on her own and would try and get us to play with her. She would step gingerly into the room and gaze intently at its occupants, then purposefully turn around and walk back out, as if to lead us to the garden. This process would be repeated until she got a response. Most of the time my wife would put down whatever she was doing, slip happily into her sandals and head outside.\
 \
 (paragraph 7) Having played to her heart’s content, Chibi would come inside and rest for a while. When she began to sleep on the sofa—like a talisman (talisman - an object thought to bring good luck) curled gently in the shape of a comma and dug up from a prehistoric archaeological site—a deep sense of happiness arrived, as if the house itself had dreamed this scene.\
 \
 (paragraph 8) Avoiding the prying eyes of the landlady, we began leaving it up to Chibi to come inside the house whenever she wanted—and with this new development I had begun little by little to understand cat lovers. Whether on TV or in all of the ubiquitous (ubiquitous - present everywhere) cat calendars, it seemed as if there was no cat comparable to her. But, though I had started to think of her as the best cat around, she was not really our cat.\
 \
 (paragraph 9) First we would hear the tinkling of the bell, and then she would appear, so we began to call her by the nickname “Tinkerbell.” Whenever we wanted her to come over, this name seemed to find itself on our lips.\
 \
 (paragraph 10) “I wonder where Tinkerbell is.” By the time my wife had gotten the words out of her mouth we’d hear the tinkling of Chibi’s bell. We’d realize that she was near at the point where, exiting the foyer next door (located at the second corner of Lightning Alley), Chibi would leap through the tear in the wire-mesh boundary of the property, dash along the side of the building, turn at the far end of the veranda, leap up onto the open area of the deck, and then, placing her front paws on the window frame at about the height of a human adult’s knee, stretch out her neck to peek inside.\
 \
 (paragraph 11) In winter she came inside. Little by little, through the crack in the partially opened window, her tendency to visit subtly developed; her appearances were repeated until, as if a silken opening in a fabric had been continuously moistened and stretched, Chibi had entered our lives. But at the same time—call it fate if you will—something else was closing in and pressing itself against that tendency.\
What is the meaning of the word “subtle” as it is used in paragraph 5?\
(A) environmental\
 (B) slight\
 (C) powerful\
 (D) rapid\

 Reading Comprehension Passage A\
 \
 The Count and the Wedding Guest\
 \
    Miss Maggie Conway and Mr. Andy Donovan are staying at the same boarding house in New York City.\
 \
    …Just coming out the door was Miss Conway. She wore a night-black dress of\
 crêpe de—crêpe de—oh, this thin black goods.(goods - fabric) Her hat was black, and from it drooped and\
 fluttered an ebon veil, filmy as a spider’s web. She stood on the top step and drew on black\
 silk gloves. Not a speck of white or a spot of color about her dress anywhere. Her rich\
 (line 5) golden hair was drawn, with scarcely a ripple, into a shining, smooth knot low on her neck.\
 Her face was plain rather than pretty, but it was now illuminated and made almost beautiful\
 by her large gray eyes that gazed above the houses across the street into the sky with an\
 expression of the most appealing sadness and melancholy. …\
    “It’s a fine, clear evening, Miss Conway,” he [Andy Donovan] said; and if the Weather\
 (line 10) Bureau could have heard the confident emphasis of his tones it would have hoisted the\
 square white signal, (square white signal - a sign of good weather) and nailed it to the mast.\
    “To them that has the heart to enjoy it, it is, Mr. Donovan,” said Miss Conway, with\
 a sigh. …\
    “I hope none of your relatives—I hope you haven’t sustained a loss?” ventured\
 (line 15) Mr. Donovan.\
    “Death has claimed,” said Miss Conway, hesitating—“not a relative, but one who—but\
 I will not intrude my grief upon you, Mr. Donovan.”\
    “Intrude?” protested Mr. Donovan. “Why, say, Miss Conway, I’d be delighted, that is,\
 I’d be sorry—I mean I’m sure nobody could sympathize with you truer than I would.”\
 (line 20)   Miss Conway smiled a little smile. And oh, it was sadder than her expression in repose. (repose - at rest) …\
    “It’s tough to be alone in New York—that’s a cinch,” said Mr. Donovan. “But, say—\
 whenever this little old town does loosen up and get friendly it goes the limit. Say you took\
 a little stroll in the park, Miss Conway—don’t you think it might chase away some of your\
 mullygrubs? And if you’d allow me—”\
 (line 25)   “Thanks, Mr. Donovan. I’d be pleased to accept of your escort if you think the company\
 of one whose heart is filled with gloom could be anyways agreeable to you.”\
    Through the open gates of the iron-railed, old, downtown park, where the elect once\
 took the air, they strolled, and found a quiet bench. …\
    “He was my fiancé,” confided Miss Conway, at the end of an hour. “We were going to\
 (line 30) be married next spring. I don’t want you to think that I am stringing you, Mr. Donovan, but\
 he was a real Count. He had an estate and a castle in Italy. Count Fernando Mazzini was\
 his name. I never saw the beat of him for elegance. Papa objected, of course, and once \
 we eloped, but papa overtook us, and took us back. I thought sure papa and Fernando \
 would fight a duel. Papa has a livery business—in P’kipsee [Poughkeepsie], you know.” … \
 (line 35)    “Three days ago I got a letter from Italy, forwarded from P’kipsee, saying that Fernando \
 had been killed in a gondola accident.” … \
    “I’ve got his picture here in my locket,” said Miss Conway, after wiping her eyes with \
 her handkerchief. “I never showed it to anybody; but I will to you, Mr. Donovan, because \
 I believe you to be a true friend.” \
 (line 40)   Mr. Donovan gazed long and with much interest at the photograph in the locket that \
 Miss Conway opened for him. The face of Count Mazzini was one to command interest. \
 It was a smooth, intelligent, bright, almost a handsome face—the face of a strong, cheerful \
 man who might well be a leader among his fellows. \
    “I have a larger one, framed, in my room,” said Miss Conway. “When we return I will\
 (line 45) show you that. They are all I have to remind me of Fernando. But he ever will be present \
 in my heart, that’s a sure thing.” \
    A subtle task confronted Mr. Donovan,—that of supplanting (supplanting - replacing) the unfortunate Count in \
 the heart of Miss Conway. This his admiration for her determined him to do. But the \
 magnitude of the undertaking did not seem to weigh upon his spirits. The sympathetic but\
 (line 50) cheerful friend was the role he essayed; (essayed - attempted) and he played it so successfully that the next \
 half-hour found them conversing pensively across two plates of ice-cream, though yet there \
 was no diminution of the sadness in Miss Conway’s large gray eyes. \
    Before they parted in the hall that evening she ran upstairs and brought down the \
 framed photograph wrapped lovingly in a white silk scarf. Mr. Donovan surveyed it with\
 (line 55) inscrutable (inscrutable - unreadable) eyes. … \
    “A fine-looking man,” said Mr. Donovan, heartily. “How would it suit you, Miss Conway, \
 to give me the pleasure of your company to Coney [Island] next Sunday afternoon?” \
    A month later they announced their engagement to Mrs. Scott and the other boarders. \
 Miss Conway continued to wear black.\
 (line 60)   A week after the announcement the two sat on the same bench in the downtown park, \
 while the fluttering leaves of the trees made a dim kinetoscopic (kinetoscopic - flickering) picture of them in the \
 moonlight. But Donovan had worn a look of abstracted gloom all day. He was so silent \
 to-night that love’s lips could not keep back any longer the questions that love’s heart \
 propounded. (propounded - put forward)\
 (line 65)   “What’s the matter, Andy, you are so solemn and grouchy to-night?”\
    “Nothing, Maggie.”\
    “I know better. Can’t I tell? You never acted this way before. What is it?” … \
    “I’ll tell you then,” said Andy, wisely, “but I guess you won’t understand it exactly. \
 You’ve heard of Mike Sullivan, haven’t you? ‘Big Mike’ Sullivan, everybody calls him.”\
 (line 70)   “No, I haven’t,” said Maggie. “And I don’t want to, if he makes you act like this. Who is \
 he?” …\
    “Well, Big Mike’s a friend of mine. I ain’t more than deuce-high in the district as far as \
 influence goes, but Mike’s as good a friend to a little man, or a poor man as he is to a big \
 one. I met him to-day on the Bowery [Street], and what do you think he does? Comes up\
 (line 75) and shakes hands. ‘Andy,’ says he, ‘I’ve been keeping cases on you. You’ve been putting in \
 some good licks over on your side of the street, and I’m proud of you. What’ll you take to \
 drink?’ He takes a cigar, and I take a highball. I told him I was going to get married in two \
 weeks. ‘Andy,’ says he, ‘send me an invitation, so I’ll keep in mind of it, and I’ll come to the \
 wedding.’ That’s what Big Mike says to me; and he always does what he says. \
 (line 80)   “You don’t understand it, Maggie, but I’d have one of my hands cut off to have Big Mike \
 Sullivan at our wedding. It would be the proudest day of my life. When he goes to a man’s \
 wedding, there’s a guy being married that’s made for life. Now, that’s why I’m maybe looking \
 sore to-night.”\
    “Why don’t you invite him, then, if he’s so much to the mustard?” (to the mustard - successful) said Maggie, lightly. …\
 (line 85)   “Maggie,” said Andy, presently, “do you think as much of me as you did of your—as you \
 did of the Count Mazzini?”\
    He waited a long time, but Maggie did not reply. And then, suddenly she leaned against \
 his shoulder and began to cry—to cry and shake with sobs, holding his arm tightly, and \
 wetting the crêpe de Chine with tears. …\
 (line 90)   But instead of being pushed away, she found Andy’s arm folding her closer. She looked \
 up and saw his face cleared and smiling. …\
    “Andy,” said Maggie, with a somewhat shy smile, after she had been thoroughly assured \
 of forgiveness, “did you believe all that story about the Count?” \
    “Well, not to any large extent,” said Andy, reaching for his cigar case, “because it’s\
 (line 95) Big Mike Sullivan’s picture you’ve got in that locket of yours.” \

Excerpt from “The Beadwork” from American Indian Stories\
 \
 by Zitkala-Sa\
 \
 (paragraph 1) Soon after breakfast mother sometimes began her beadwork. On a bright, clear day, she pulled out the wooden pegs that pinned the skirt of our wigwam to the ground, and rolled the canvas part way up on its frame of slender poles. Then the cool morning breezes swept freely through our dwelling, now and then wafting the perfume of sweet grasses from the newly burnt prairie.\
 \
 (paragraph 2) Untying the long tasseled strings that bound a small brown buckskin bag, my mother spread upon a mat beside her bunches of colored beads, just as an artist arranges the paints upon his palette. On a lapboard she smoothed out a double sheet of soft white buckskin; and drawing from a beaded case that hung on the left of her wide\
 belt a long, narrow blade, she trimmed the buckskin into shape. Often she worked upon small moccasins for her small daughter. Then I became intensely interested in her designing. With a proud, beaming face, I watched her work. In imagination, I saw myself walking in a new pair of snugly fitting moccasins. I felt the envious eyes of my playmates upon the pretty red beads decorating my feet.\
 \
 (paragraph 3) Close beside my mother I sat on a rug, with a scrap of buckskin in one hand and an awl in the other. This was the beginning of my practical observation lessons in the art of beadwork. From a skein of finely twisted threads of silvery sinews my mother pulled out a single one. With an awl she pierced the buckskin, and skillfully threaded it with the white sinew. Picking up the tiny beads one by one, she strung them with the point of her thread, always twisting it carefully after every stitch. . . .\
 \
 (paragraph 4) Always after these confining lessons I was wild with surplus spirits, and found joyous relief in running loose in the open again. Many a summer afternoon a party of four or five of my playmates roamed over the hills with me. We each carried a light, sharpened rod about four feet long, with which we pried up certain sweet roots. When we had eaten all the choice roots we chanced upon, we shouldered our rods and strayed off into patches of a stalky plant under whose yellow blossoms we found little crystal drops of gum. Drop by drop we gathered this nature’s rock-candy, until each of us could boast of a lump the size of a small bird’s egg. Soon satiated (satiated - completely satisfied) with its woody flavor, we tossed away our gum, to return again to the sweet roots.\
 \
 (paragraph 5) I remember well how we used to exchange our necklaces, beaded belts, and sometimes even our moccasins. We pretended to offer them as gifts to one another. We delighted in impersonating our own mothers. We talked of things we had heard them say in their conversations. We imitated their various manners, even to the inflection of their voices. In the lap of the prairie we seated ourselves upon our feet, and leaning our painted cheeks in the palms of our hands, we rested our elbows on our knees, and bent forward as old women were most accustomed to do.\
 \
 (paragraph 6) While one was telling of some heroic deed recently done by a near relative, the rest of us listened attentively, and exclaimed in undertones “Han! han!” (yes! yes!) whenever the speaker paused for breath, or sometimes for our sympathy. As the discourse became more thrilling, according to our ideas, we raised our voices in these interjections. In these impersonations our parents were led to say only those things that were in common favor.\
 \
 (paragraph 7) No matter how exciting a tale we might be rehearsing, the mere shifting of a cloud shadow in the landscape near by was sufficient to change our impulses; and soon we were all chasing the great shadows that played among the hills. We shouted and whooped in the chase; laughing and calling to one another, we were like little sportive nymphs (sportive nymphs - playful creatures of the woods) on that Dakota sea of rolling green.\
 \
 (paragraph 8) On one occasion I forgot the cloud shadow in a strange notion to catch up with my own shadow. Standing straight and still, I began to glide after it, putting out one foot cautiously. When, with the greatest care, I set my foot in advance of myself, my shadow crept onward too. Then again I tried it; this time with the other foot. Still again my shadow escaped me. I began to run; and away flew my shadow, always just a step beyond me. Faster and faster I ran, setting my teeth and clenching my fists, determined to overtake my own fleet shadow. But ever swifter it glided before me while I was growing breathless and hot. Slackening my speed, I was greatly vexed that my shadow should check its pace also. Daring it to the utmost, as I thought, I sat down upon a rock imbedded in the hillside.\
 \
 (paragraph 9) So! my shadow had the impudence (impudence - nerve) to sit down beside me!\
 \
 (paragraph 10) Now my comrades caught up with me, and began to ask why I was running away so fast.\
 \
 (paragraph 11) “Oh, I was chasing my shadow! Didn’t you ever do that?” I inquired, surprised that they should not understand.\
 \
 (paragraph 12) They planted their moccasined feet firmly upon my shadow to stay it, and I arose. Again my shadow slipped away, and moved as often as I did. Then we gave up trying to catch my shadow.\
 \
 (paragraph 13) Before this peculiar experience, I have no distinct memory of having recognized any vital bond between myself and my shadow. I never gave it an afterthought.\
 \
 (paragraph 14) Returning to our borrowed belts and trinkets, we rambled homeward. That evening, as on other evenings, I went to sleep over my legends.\

 . . . Spain’s stubborn possession of the Mississippi’s mouth kept alive the possibility that the United States would rip itself apart. Yet something unexpected changed the course of history. In 1791, Africans enslaved in the French Caribbean colony of Saint-Domingue [Haiti] exploded in a revolt unprecedented in human history. Saint-Domingue, the eastern third of the island of Hispaniola, was at that time the ultimate sugar island, the imperial engine of French economic growth. But on a single August night, the mill of the first slavery’s growth stopped turning. All across Saint-Domingue’s sugar country, the most profitable stretch of real estate on the planet, enslaved people burst into the country mansions. They slaughtered enslavers, set torches to sugar houses and cane fields, and then marched by the thousand on Cap-Français, the seat of colonial rule. Thrown back, they regrouped. Revolt spread across the colony. . . .\

 . . . I have heard that you are a kind, compassionate monarch. I am sure that you will not do to others what you yourself do not desire. I have also heard that you have instructed every British ship that sails for Canton not to bring any prohibited goods to China. It seems that your policy is as enlightened as it is proper. The fact that British ships have continued to bring opium to China results perhaps from the impossibility of making a thorough inspection of all of them owing to their large numbers. I am sending you this letter to reiterate [repeat] the seriousness with which we enforce the law of the Celestial Empire and to make sure that merchants from your honorable country will not attempt to violate it again. . . .\

 Excerpt from Snowflake Bentley\
 by Jacqueline Briggs Martin\
 \
 (paragraph 1) In the days when farmers worked with ox and sled and cut the dark with lantern light, there lived a boy who loved snow more than anything in the world. Willie Bentley’s happiest days were snowstorm days. He watched snowflakes on his mittens, on the dried grass of Vermont farm fields, on the dark metal handle of the barn door. He said snow was as beautiful as butterflies, or apple blossoms.\
 \
 (paragraph 2) He could net butterflies and show them to his older brother, Charlie. He could pick apple blossoms and take them to his mother. But he could not share snowflakes because he could not save them.\
 \
 (paragraph 3) When his mother gave him an old microscope, he used it to look at flowers, raindrops, and blades of grass. Best of all, he used it to look at snow. While other children built forts and pelted snowballs at roosting crows, Willie was catching snowflakes. Day after stormy day he studied the icy crystals.\
 \
 (paragraph 4) Their intricate patterns were even more beautiful than he had imagined. He expected to find whole flakes that were the same, that were copies of each other. But he never did. Willie decided he must find a way to save snowflakes so others could see their wonderful designs. For three winters he tried drawing snow crystals. They always melted before he could finish.\
 \
 (paragraph 5) When he was sixteen, Willie read of a camera with its own microscope. “If I had that camera I could photograph snowflakes,” he told his mother. Willie’s mother knew that he would not be happy until he could share what he had seen.\
 \
 (paragraph6) “Fussing with snow is just foolishness,” his father said. Still, he loved his son. When Willie was seventeen his parents spent their savings and bought the camera. It was taller than a newborn calf, and cost as much as his father’s herd of ten cows. Willie was sure it was the best of all cameras.\
 \
 (paragraph 7) Even so his first pictures were failures—no better than shadows. Yet he would not quit. Mistake by mistake, snowflake by snowflake, Willie worked through every storm. Winter ended, the snow melted, and he had no good pictures. He waited for another season of snow. One day, in the second winter, he tried a new experiment. And it\
 worked! Willie had figured out how to photograph snowflakes! “Now everyone can see the great beauty in a tiny crystal,” he said.\
 \
 (paragraph 8) But in those days, no one cared. Neighbors laughed at the idea of photographing snow. “Snow in Vermont is as common as dirt,” they said. “We don’t need pictures.” Willie said the photographs would be his gift to the world. While other farmers sat by the fire or rode to town with horse and sleigh, Willie studied snowstorms. He stood at the shed door and held out a black tray to catch the flakes.\
 \
 (paragraph 9) When he found only jumbled, broken crystals, he brushed the tray clean with a turkey feather and held it out again. He waited hours for just the right crystal and didn’t notice the cold. If the shed were warm the snow would melt. If he breathed on the black tray the snow would melt. If he twitched a muscle as he held the snow crystal on the long wood pick the snowflake would break. He had to work fast or the snowflake would evaporate before he could slide it into place and take its picture. Some winters he was able to make only a few dozen good pictures. Some winters he made hundreds. . . .\
 \
 (paragraph 10) But his snow crystal pictures were always his favorites. He gave copies away or sold them for a few cents. He made special pictures as gifts for birthdays. He held evening slide shows on the lawns of his friends. Children and adults sat on the grass and watched while Willie projected his slides onto a sheet hung over a clothesline.\
 \
 (paragraph 11) He wrote about snow and published his pictures in magazines. He gave speeches about snow to faraway scholars and neighborhood skywatchers. “You are doing great work,” said a professor from Wisconsin. The little farmer came to be known as the world’s expert on snow, “the Snowflake Man.” But he never grew rich. He spent every\
 penny on his pictures. Willie said there were treasures in snow. “I can’t afford to miss a single snowstorm,” he told a friend. “I never know when I will find some wonderful prize.”\
What does the reader learn about Bentley from paragraphs 10 and 11?\
(A) He was more interested in sharing his work than in making money from it.\
 (B) He worked hard to develop a way of making photographs of snowflakes.\
 (C) He wanted to find out if all snowflakes were different from each other.\
 (D) He was able to follow his interests because of the help he got from his family.\

Alan is on a volcano on Titan, a moon of Saturn. As the story opens, Alan is stranded on its summit in his space crawler. Luckily, he has brought along his mechanical wings.\
 \
 Excerpt from Fly for Your Life\
 \
 by John Frizell\
 \
 (paragraph 1) Alan knew there was no way back to the base and no way the crew there could help him remotely—the other crawler was down for maintenance. He could go down this side of the stream for 23 kilometers, to a flat area where the flowing liquid would spread out and be shallow enough to cross; then go back 23 kilometers to the far side of the bridge. One problem: he would definitely run out of air before he got there.\
 \
 (paragraph 2) Then Alan thought of the folded flight wings he had attached to his suit. Could he fly across the river and then walk to the base? Some quick calculations showed it wouldn’t work. He had enough air, but the battery that powered the heater of the suit he wore to stay alive on Titan was only good for an hour, not the four-hour walk it would take to reach the base. Spacewalks were usually done trailing a power cable plugged in to the suit. The cable carried power from the crawler to supplement the suit’s battery. Without the supplemental power, he would freeze solid in 10 minutes once the battery was exhausted.\
 \
 (paragraph 3) Alan knew flying the whole way was impossible. Even with Titan’s thick atmosphere and low gravity the suit made flying hard work, worse than running uphill carrying a sack of cement. No one could stay aloft for more than 10 minutes. It would be at least a half-hour flight to the base.\
 \
 (paragraph 4) He needed more than wings alone to get back alive. Then it came to him. Bolted to the side of the crawler was a squat, black cylinder containing compressed nitrogen at 200 bar, compressed Titanian atmosphere in fact, used for cleaning gunk off the crawler’s treads. Alan struggled with the bolts, working carefully in the searing cold with tools as brittle as glass. When he had the cylinder off, propped up, and pointing at the sky, he put his wings on, and then took them off, repeating the task until he could do it without thinking about it. . . .\
 \
 (paragraph 5) He pulled the power cable out of his suit’s hip socket and, before he could change his mind, gave a sharp tug on a line that he had attached to the valve of the pressure cylinder. The cylinder hissed like a giant snake, as high-pressure nitrogen blasted out, and then shot into the sky. A length of climbing rope he had attached to it went taut and snatched him into the air, where he was buffeted and tossed by the jet of nitrogen pouring down on him. It was like being caught under a breaking wave, pounded again and again by the surf. He was directly under the cylinder, using his weight and drag to keep the nozzle pointed down as the cylinder lofted him into Titan’s sky. The ground beneath, blurred by the motion, made it impossible to gauge height or direction.\
 \
 (paragraph 6) Time slowed; his shuddering world narrowed to the readout of the Titan Positioning System (TPS)—the icy moon’s equivalent of GPS. Gradually, the pounding lessened as the rate of climb shown on the readout passed its peak and began falling. Alan waited. Just before it hit zero, he cut the rope. The cylinder, relieved of his drag, flew off, dwindling to a black dot and then disappearing into the empty sky above. Now he was coasting upward, propelled by the momentum imparted to him by the nitrogen rocket. He was high in the air, but already he was slowing under the drag of the thick atmosphere. He had to get the wings on before the downward fall began. Once he started to move with some speed, he would begin to spin and never get them on. The first wing stuck and he had to take his arm out of the loops and try again. . . .\
 \
 (paragraph 7) He was gathering speed on his way down before he got the second one on. He spread his wings and rolled into a comfortable position, soaring over the moon’s dimly lit surface. The TPS showed that he was heading away from the base. He banked in an easy curve and settled on a course for home. All he had to do was hold the wings rigid and enjoy the ride. He took an occasional flap, just for fun. . . .\
 \
 (paragraph 8) As Alan glided toward the base, he flapped more often, watching the height-abovesurface and distance-to-target displays. As they unwound, an unpleasant feeling, like a trace of the frigid atmosphere outside, crept into his stomach. His elevation was dropping dangerously, with over three kilometers left to go on distance-to-target. He could see details on the surface more clearly now, because he was flying so low. . . .\
 \
 (paragraph 9) Alan forced himself to stay calm. Panic would mean disaster. He started flapping his wings faster, faster, faster. . . . He could feel himself lifting with every beat of the massive appendages. Faster, faster, faster. . . . His descent rate began to slow, but the muscles in his arms burned with pain. . . .\
 \
 (paragraph 10) Time stretched out endlessly.\
 \
 (paragraph 11) The TPS buzzed loudly in his helmet. Target. the station’s beacon was directly below him. He could barely feel his arms, but something made them stop flapping. He gratefully fell out of the sky, wrapped in a ball of pain, with barely the strength to flare his wings one last time for a soft landing. . . .\
 \
 (paragraph 12) Then he saw someone running toward him with a power cable in hand. Voices boomed into his helmet. It sounded like the whole station was in the control room waiting to see if he had made it.\
 \
 (paragraph 13) “Alan! ALAN! Say something! Can you move? Are you receiving this?” He recognized the voice of the base leader. . . .\
 \
 (paragraph 14) As the crew lifted him carefully onto a stretcher, he looked up at Titan’s hazy sky. I flew for my life today, he thought. I survived. That’s the only record that matters.\
Why does Alan use the compressed nitrogen?\
(A) The nitrogen’s energy will propel him toward the base before he runs out of air.\
 (B) The nitrogen is used for emergencies when astronauts become stranded.\
 (C) The nitrogen will stay liquid in the atmosphere.\
 (D) The nitrogen’s cable can be cut and it will continue to work.\

 (paragraph 2) Janet was born on March 7, 1938, in Iowa City, Iowa, and lived on a farm for the first few years of her life. Her father, an airline pilot, later moved the family to South Florida, where Janet took up flying.\
 (paragraph 3) At 13, she had already flown an airplane. At age 16, Janet decided she wanted to try a free-fall parachute jump. In free-fall, the parachutist jumps out of a plane without opening the chute. After falling several hundred feet at more than 100 miles an hour, the cord is pulled to open the chute. Then, if all goes well, the parachutist floats safely to the ground.\
 (paragraph 4) Her father wouldn’t hear of it. “Absolutely not,” he said. “No free-fall!”\
 (paragraph 5) But Janet persisted. Finally, her father gave in. “Just one time,” he said, “but you have to be careful and do it the right way.”\
 (paragraph 6) He would allow her to jump only on two conditions: He would fly the plane and she would receive parachuting lessons before the jump.\
 (paragraph 7) Since there were no parachuting schools in South Florida at the time, Janet’s father hired a pro to give her private lessons. In her autobiography, Janet Guthrie—A Life at Full Throttle, Janet said the pro taught her how to pull the rip cord that opened the chute, how to absorb the shock after landing, and how to fasten the helmet so it wouldn’t fly off.\
 ♦ ♦ ♦\
 (paragraph 8) By the time she was 21, she had earned a commercial pilot’s license. She flew whenever she could break away from her classes at the University of Michigan.\
 (paragraph 9) After graduating, Guthrie got a job as a physicist in the aerospace industry. She saved her money for an entire year and bought a car. Guthrie wasn’t satisfied with just any car. She chose a Jaguar XK 120—the sleek and popular sports car that she had dreamed about since she was a teenager.\
 aerospace = a business involved with space flight\
 (paragraph 10) At first, Guthrie enjoyed just driving the car around Long Island, outside New York City. Then she heard about a local sports car club where members could compete. She loved her car and wanted to see how it would do on a track. Soon she was entering races—and winning them.\
 (paragraph 11) Excited by her success, Guthrie attended a driving school in Connecticut. She was a natural. Her instructor, veteran driver Gordon McKenzie, liked the way she handled her car. He suggested she try auto racing.\
 (paragraph 12) A thrill shot through Guthrie. What a great idea. Off she went to enroll in a racing car drivers’ school sponsored by the Sports Car Club of America. Guthrie swapped her Jaguar for a higher-priced model built especially for racing—the XK 140. Before long she taught herself how to take apart and rebuild its engine like a pro.\
 ♦ ♦ ♦\
 (paragraph 13) Guthrie’s career started to pick up speed.\
 (paragraph 14) She entered races all over the United States, finishing in some of the country’s most celebrated long-distance competitions. In 1973, she won the North Atlantic Road Racing Championship. A champion, yes, but a tired champion. By then she had been racing for 13 years. She was exhausted, broke, and thinking of leaving the sport.\
 (paragraph 15) That’s when she got the phone call. Someone named Vollstedt was asking her to drive his car in the 1976 Indy 500. No woman had ever driven in that race. This has to be a prank, thought Guthrie. But Vollstedt, an auto designer and builder from Oregon, wasn’t kidding. Could she drive a “championship” car? That was the big question.\
 (paragraph 16) With their open cockpits, wide wheelbases, and rear engines, championship cars were much different than the closed sports cars Guthrie had been accustomed to driving for many years.\
 (paragraph 17) “Before she would agree to drive for me,” Vollstedt said, “she wanted to see if she could handle the car.”\
 (paragraph 18) Vollstedt was wondering the same thing, too. He arranged for a secret test at the Ontario Motor Speedway near Los Angeles.\
 (paragraph 19) To get into top physical shape for Vollstedt’s test, Guthrie did exercises in front of her TV. One day she lost her balance, landed hard on her left foot, and fell to the floor. The doctors told her she had broken a bone and they put her foot in a heavy cast. How am I going to drive a racing car? she worried. Will I miss my big chance?\
 ♦ ♦ ♦\
 (paragraph 20) Broken ankle and all, Guthrie stepped into an unfamiliar car. She hit the accelerator. When her car got up to speed, Guthrie couldn’t believe the feeling. “What a thrill,” she said. “It was like going to the moon.”\
 (paragraph 21) Vollstedt was impressed with her time—an average speed of 178.52 miles per hour and a top speed of 196 mph.\
 (paragraph 22) Test passed.\
 (paragraph 23) She had showed Vollstedt she could drive the car. Now she had to show the rest of the world.\
Which idea from the article does the title “ ‘Janet Guthrie: Lady in the Fast Lane’ from Profiles in Sports Courage” best support?\
(A) Guthrie was a hard worker and saved money to achieve her goals.\
 (B) Guthrie was famous for participating in a race with a broken foot.\

 Excerpt from Snowflake Bentley\
 by Jacqueline Briggs Martin\
 \
 (paragraph 1) In the days when farmers worked with ox and sled and cut the dark with lantern light, there lived a boy who loved snow more than anything in the world. Willie Bentley’s happiest days were snowstorm days. He watched snowflakes on his mittens, on the dried grass of Vermont farm fields, on the dark metal handle of the barn door. He said snow was as beautiful as butterflies, or apple blossoms.\
 \
 (paragraph 2) He could net butterflies and show them to his older brother, Charlie. He could pick apple blossoms and take them to his mother. But he could not share snowflakes because he could not save them.\
 \
 (paragraph 3) When his mother gave him an old microscope, he used it to look at flowers, raindrops, and blades of grass. Best of all, he used it to look at snow. While other children built forts and pelted snowballs at roosting crows, Willie was catching snowflakes. Day after stormy day he studied the icy crystals.\
 \
 (paragraph 4) Their intricate patterns were even more beautiful than he had imagined. He expected to find whole flakes that were the same, that were copies of each other. But he never did. Willie decided he must find a way to save snowflakes so others could see their wonderful designs. For three winters he tried drawing snow crystals. They always melted before he could finish.\
 \
 (paragraph 5) When he was sixteen, Willie read of a camera with its own microscope. “If I had that camera I could photograph snowflakes,” he told his mother. Willie’s mother knew that he would not be happy until he could share what he had seen.\
 \
 (paragraph6) “Fussing with snow is just foolishness,” his father said. Still, he loved his son. When Willie was seventeen his parents spent their savings and bought the camera. It was taller than a newborn calf, and cost as much as his father’s herd of ten cows. Willie was sure it was the best of all cameras.\
 \
 (paragraph 7) Even so his first pictures were failures—no better than shadows. Yet he would not quit. Mistake by mistake, snowflake by snowflake, Willie worked through every storm. Winter ended, the snow melted, and he had no good pictures. He waited for another season of snow. One day, in the second winter, he tried a new experiment. And it\
 worked! Willie had figured out how to photograph snowflakes! “Now everyone can see the great beauty in a tiny crystal,” he said.\
 \
 (paragraph 8) But in those days, no one cared. Neighbors laughed at the idea of photographing snow. “Snow in Vermont is as common as dirt,” they said. “We don’t need pictures.” Willie said the photographs would be his gift to the world. While other farmers sat by the fire or rode to town with horse and sleigh, Willie studied snowstorms. He stood at the shed door and held out a black tray to catch the flakes.\
 \
 (paragraph 9) When he found only jumbled, broken crystals, he brushed the tray clean with a turkey feather and held it out again. He waited hours for just the right crystal and didn’t notice the cold. If the shed were warm the snow would melt. If he breathed on the black tray the snow would melt. If he twitched a muscle as he held the snow crystal on the long wood pick the snowflake would break. He had to work fast or the snowflake would evaporate before he could slide it into place and take its picture. Some winters he was able to make only a few dozen good pictures. Some winters he made hundreds. . . .\
 \
 (paragraph 10) But his snow crystal pictures were always his favorites. He gave copies away or sold them for a few cents. He made special pictures as gifts for birthdays. He held evening slide shows on the lawns of his friends. Children and adults sat on the grass and watched while Willie projected his slides onto a sheet hung over a clothesline.\
 \
 (paragraph 11) He wrote about snow and published his pictures in magazines. He gave speeches about snow to faraway scholars and neighborhood skywatchers. “You are doing great work,” said a professor from Wisconsin. The little farmer came to be known as the world’s expert on snow, “the Snowflake Man.” But he never grew rich. He spent every\
 penny on his pictures. Willie said there were treasures in snow. “I can’t afford to miss a single snowstorm,” he told a friend. “I never know when I will find some wonderful prize.”\

The First Public Park\
 by Marcia Amidon Lusted\
 \
 It was just an idea for more than a decade, but by 1857, New Yorkers were serious\
 about building a grand public park. New York was the largest metropolis in the nation,\
 and its citizens wanted to show the world that Americans were not just concerned about\
 industry, wealth, and materialism but that they also appreciated natural landscapes.\
 (line 5) Using eminent domain, the city took more than 840 acres of land in the center of\
 Manhattan for the new park. The area was considered to lack any real estate value—it\
 included swamps, bluffs, and rock outcroppings as well as two reservoirs that supplied city\
 water. It was home to about 1,600 poor residents, however. This population of pig farmers,\
 gardeners, and an African American settlement called Seneca Village was displaced by the\
 (line 10) park’s construction.\
 The Central Park Commission held a competition to choose someone to design the\
 park. Among the professional and amateur designers who entered the contest was a team\
 consisting of an American agriculturalist and a British-born architect: Frederick Law\
 Olmsted and Calvert Vaux.\
 (line 15) It was Vaux’s idea for the two men to join forces. A talented draftsman, Vaux used his\
 detailed drawings to show how their idea for the park would look. An accomplished\
 writer, Olmsted wrote the report that described their plan and included lists of proposed\
 plants and an estimated budget. They submitted their plan, called “Greensward,” a day\
 after the commission’s deadline.\
 (line 20) Greensward included pastoral views and rolling meadows, just like those in traditional\
 English parks. The plan offered beautiful vistas of green lawns and natural rocky ridges as\
 well as more formal locations for public gatherings.\
 It also included four roads that cut through the park to carry carriage traffic from one\
 side to the other. Olmsted and Vaux designed these major thoroughfares to run eight feet\
 (line 25) below the park’s surface so they would not disrupt the park’s views and rural feeling.\
 Pedestrian paths, equestrian roads, and carriage drives were all kept separate from one\
 another. Vaux designed more than 40 bridges so that these various paths would never have\
 to cross on the same level.\
 Unlike some of the other submissions that included grand, elaborate buildings,\
 (line 30) Olmsted and Vaux kept structures to a minimum, with only four in the original plan. The\
 design and materials for the buildings were also specifically selected to blend in with the\
 natural environment.\
 Greensward was announced the winner in the spring of 1858. The selection committee\
 debated over certain design points—some of the members wanted a wide grand avenue in\
 (line 35) the park, similar to those found in European parks. Olmsted argued against it by saying\
 that stately roads would “destroy scenery at great cost” and that “straight lines of trees or\
 stately architecture . . . belong not to parks for the people but to palatial gardens.” Olmsted\
 and Vaux had created their design for the recreation of all people, not just the wealthy.\
 The park was to be a place where all New Yorkers could enjoy nature. Its ultimate design\
 (line 40) would retain this feeling.\
 The construction of Central Park was one of the most massive public works projects\
 to take place in 19th-century New York. It required about 20,000 workers to reshape the\
 natural features of the land according to Olmsted and Vaux’s plan. Three hundred\
 thousand cubic yards of rock were blasted into rubble, and the resulting stone was crushed\
 (line 45) to use as paving material. Nearly three million cubic yards of soil were moved, and more\
 than 270,000 trees and shrubs were planted. Swamps were transformed into scenic lakes,\
 and extensive drainage work was done to get rid of small streams and pools. By 1866,\
 more than $5 million had been spent on construction. The park’s final price tag was more\
 than $10 million. In the end, this entirely planned park, stretching from 59th Street to\
 (line 50) 110th Street and from Fifth to Eighth avenues, had a completely natural, unplanned\
 feeling to it.\
 The process of overseeing the park’s construction and accounting for its expenditures\
 exhausted Olmsted. He required a six-week rest cure in Europe in 1859 and suffered a\
 severe broken leg in 1860 that laid him up, but he had the plans for the park spread out in\
 (line 55) his bedroom so he could continue to work. When he tried to resign from the project in\
 1861, however, the commission knew that it could not afford to lose him. Ultimately,\
 Olmsted’s duties and responsibilities were decreased, and when he departed the project to\
 serve in the U.S. Sanitary Commission during the Civil War (1861–1865), the park’s\
 construction was completed under park commission president Andrew Green and Vaux.\
 (line 60) Olmsted’s involvement in Central Park spanned nearly 20 years. It was not the only\
 site he worked or consulted on, and, for a couple of years, other projects demanded his\
 full attention. But from the time their plan was selected until the mid-1870s, Olmsted and\
 Vaux were associated with the park on and off. Sometimes, their titles as landscape\
 architect advisors required little on-site work. At other times, such as when Olmsted filled\
 (line 65) in as acting president of the Department of Public Parks, he looked into establishing lights\
 in the park at night and assessing the park’s safety. By 1878, however, Olmsted’s role with\
 the park officially ended.\
 Today, Central Park stands as one of Olmsted’s greatest legacies. It contains numerous\
 playgrounds and athletic fields. Runners and bicyclists make use of the wide, rolling paths.\
 (line 70) There are places to skate in the winter and boat in the summer. Concerts, plays, and rallies\
 take place there. Sculptures by famous artists can be found throughout the park. There are\
 also quiet places to walk, sit and read a book, or watch birds. Central Park has become a\
 world-famous site that attracts more than 25 million visitors each year. It also is a shining\
 example of Olmsted’s desire to create and preserve public green spaces in urban places for\
 (line 75) generations of people to enjoy.\
Read these sentences from lines 37 through 40 of the article.\
 Olmsted and Vaux had created their design for the recreation of all people, not just the wealthy. The park was to be a place where all New Yorkers could enjoy nature. Its ultimate design would retain this feeling.\
 Lines 37 through 40 relate to lines 68 through 72 by showing that the\
(A) role of the park has changed over time\
 (B) park is now used throughout the year\
 (C) park designers achieved their goal\
 (D) size of the park is increasing\

Reading Comprehension Passage A\
 \
 Screeno\
 In the following passage, Cornelius Schmidt seeks refuge from a gloomy, rainy night by going to a movie. \
 \
 …At the door [of the theater] the uniformed ticket taker gave him a card on which was \
 printed a kind of checkerboard, having in each box a number. It was obviously the old game \
 of Lotto, the object being to get five numbers which were successive either horizontally or\
 vertically or in a diagonal. In the center, amid numbered boxes, was a box entitled\
 (line 5) GRATIS; (GRATIS - free, a space that could count as any number called) the management gave this box to the audience. …\
    The theatre fell into a semi-darkness, not the movie darkness, but one in which discreet\
 lights shone on both sides of the theatre and both sides of the stage. A white and pink\
 clockface flashed on the screen. It was, in fact, like a roulette wheel, and had numbers\
 running from 1 to 100. In the center was a pointer, which suddenly began to whirl furiously \
 (line 10) about the clockface, and then slowed down, and then stopped.\
    \"Ninety-nine!\" said the businesslike yet airy young man in an authoritative voice.\
 An usher wrote down the number upon a blackboard to the right of the screen. The pointer \
 spun again, at a tremendous pace, so that it was almost a moving blur for a moment, and\
 then clarified into its arrow-like straightness. The actual wheel was, of course, in the\
 (line 15) projection room.\
    \"Fifty-four!\" said the young master of ceremonies, simulating a dramatic tone.\
    \"SCREENO!\" cried a voice from the balcony in a mocking voice, while everyone\
 laughed, for obviously no one could have SCREENO as yet.\
    \"I am sorry, ladies and gentlemen,\" said the young man in an affable (affable - friendly) voice,\" but we will \
 (line 20) have to ask you not to be humorous about this. After all, money is involved, and there has\
 been much confusion in the past because various people insisted upon trying to be\
 funny.\"…\
    The pointer was revolving again. \"Thirty-nine!\" announced the young man. The\
 audience was not yet warmed up, because too few numbers had been called for anyone to \
 (line 25) be on the verge of winning. Cornelius, however, also had this third number and was pleased \
 no little by the course of events.\
    \"Forty-nine!\" announced the young man. …\
    \"Fourteen!\" cried the young man into the microphone which made his voice even more\
 official than otherwise. Cornelius did not have the number. He assured himself that the\
 (line 30) game was a fraud, that the management was obviously not going to permit anyone to win so \
 much money and that the whole business would obviously be controlled in the projection \
 room or by arranging the numbers on the cards. There was only one more chance, a drop\
 in the ocean. He slouched back in his seat, chiding himself for his great excitement. …\
    \"Twenty-five!\" the master of ceremonies called out.\
 (line 35)    \"Twenty-five! Twenty-five!\" said Cornelius to himself, and then, finding the number on\
 his card as the fifth consecutive horizontal number, he rose in his seat and shouted:\
    \"SCREENO!\" in a too loud voice which broke, and began to issue (to issue - to exit) from his aisle,\
 tripping over the feet of the people seated near him, some of whom were solicitous (solicitous - helpful) of his\
 walk, and eager to provide good advice as he passed. The attractiveness of the winner shone\
 (line 40) in him. …\
    An usher took his card, and checked it with the numbers on the blackboard. The young\
 man came over to oversee the usher. It seemed as if something was wrong, someone\
 had miscalculated, to look at the young man. The checking was done several times.\
 Very bureaucratic, said Cornelius to himself. Recovering, as the checkup proved that\
 (line 45) Cornelius had indeed won, he shook Cornelius’s hand and the whole theatre lighted up.\
    \"Lucky fellow,\" cried the balcony voice, amusing the audience again, by the envious\
 tone in his voice. …\
    The usher arrived with the money just as the persistent balcony voice called out,\
 \"Let’s go on with the show,\" and the audience began to clap again, wishing to have its\
 (line 50) chance at the other prizes.\
    But then, as the money was delivered to the young assistant manager, and he began\
 officiously to count it out, shuffle it, and arrange it, before paying Cornelius, a hoarse and \
 disused voice cried from the balcony:\
    \"SCREENO! SCREENO!\" …\
 (line 55)   \"SCREENO!\" came the voice again, this time nearer, as the new winner approached\
 the stairs from the balcony to the orchestra. The young assistant manager and the ushers \
 looked at each other in dismay. Something had obviously gone wrong, for usually no one\
 won the jackpot; two winners was inconceivable and would lead to bankruptcy. Someone\
 was going to lose his job because of this. …\
 (line 60)   \"My name is Casper Weingarten,\" said the old man, unasked, intruding himself upon\
 the huddle of the assistant manager and the ushers. He was very nervous, very excited.\
 \"I am a musician,\" he said, but no one paid any attention to him, except Cornelius.\
    And then the young assistant manager came over to the old man and, holding the card\
 up, showed him that he had not won, that he had mistaken a 7 for a 1 because the print had\
 (line 65) been on the left-hand side. \"Perhaps you’ll win one of the other prizes,\" he said,\
 courteously, \"since you already have four numbers in a row.\" …\
    Cornelius came over to look into the matter for himself. He took the card in his hand\
 and looked at the number in question. The old man looked at him, and then turned to the\
 assistant manager, saying:\
 (line 70)   \"Give me my money! I have won!\" …\
    \"Look here,\" said Cornelius tactfully to the assistant manager, \"it seems to me that you\
 can only assume that this is a 1. The blur is too faint to make it a seven.\"\
    \"I know it is a 7,\" said the assistant manager angrily, and when he said that, Cornelius\
 recognized immediately that he was so sure because the cards had been prepared in\
 (line 75) advance to obviate the possibility of two winners of the jackpot, or even one. Seeing this,\
 Cornelius began to feel sick and angry, as he always did when confronted with fraud or\
 cheating.\
    \"All my life I’ve been cheated,\" said the old man, wringing his hands. \"Give me my\
 money.\" An usher took his arm, as if to lead him from the stage, but the assistant manager\
 (line 80) deterred him, unwilling as yet to resort to force. …\
    \"My good man,\" said the assistant manager, \"Your hard luck is not my fault, nor this\
 theatre’s responsibility. Please do not cause a disturbance. Now if both of you will leave the\
 stage, we can go on with the other prizes and with the show.\"\
    In answer, the old man sat down upon the stage, looking grotesque there, with his head\
 (line 85) turned up. \"I will sit here until I am paid,\" he said tearfully. …\
    But the audience was won over, for no one wished to lose his chance at the remaining\
 $50. There was a murmuring of voices and someone cried out:\
    \"Go home and give us a chance.\" …\
    \"Call a cop,\" said another. …\
 (line 90)   Cornelius meditated with himself for a moment and then said: \"Listen, I will give you\
 half of the jackpot. Come on before you’re arrested.\" …\
    \"No,\" said Weingarten, \"I don’t want your money. I want mine. Give me my money,\"\
 he said towards the assistant manager.\
    Cornelius considered matters with himself again and came to a decision. Easy come,\
 (line 95) easy go, he said to himself, and then he told the old musician that he could have the whole\
 jackpot. The manager protested immediately, but Cornelius took the bills from his pocket\
 and began to count them out and give them to the musician, who accepted them with\
 a guilty look and trembling hands.\
    The audience saw what was happening and applauded vigorously, not because it was\
 (line 100) genuinely moved, but because it felt that it ought to applaud. Such applause is heard at\
 public gatherings when an abstraction too vacuous (vacuous - insincere) is mentioned or tribute is paid to a man\
 long dead. The assistant manager, trying to move in on Cornelius’s credit, came over to\
 shake hands with Cornelius. Cornelius, tempted to reject the proffered hand, accepted it\

 (line 105)   The old man had risen and come over to Cornelius.\
    \"Thank you very much for your kindness,\" he said in the estranged voice of those who\
 have been weeping or overexcited.\
    \"Not at all,\" said Cornelius formally. Both descended from the stage together. …\

 This is the true story of a Kenyan woman named Wangari Maathai.\
 Excerpt from Seeds of Change:\
 Planting a Path to Peace\
 by Jen Cullerton Johnson\
 \
 (paragraph 1) “Come,” Wangari’s mother called. She beckoned her young daughter over to a tall tree with a wide, smooth trunk and a crown of green, oval leaves.\
 \
 (paragraph 2) “Feel,” her mother whispered.\
 \
 (paragraph 3) Wangari spread her small hands over the tree’s trunk. She smoothed her fingers over the rough bark.\
 \
 (paragraph 4) “This is the mugumo,” her mother said. “It is home to many. It feeds many too.”\
 \
 (paragraph 5) She snapped off a wild fig from a low branch, and gave it to her daughter. Wangari ate the delicious fruit, just as geckos and elephants did. High in the tree, birds chirped in their nests. The branches bounced with jumping monkeys.\
 \
 (paragraph 6) “Our people, the Kikuyu of Kenya, believe that our ancestors rest in the tree’s shade,” her mother explained.\
 \
 (paragraph 7) Wangari wrapped her arms around the trunk as if hugging her great-grandmother’s spirit. She promised never to cut down the tree. . . .\
 \
 ((paragraph 8) When Wangari finished elementary school, she was eleven years old. Her mind was like a seed rooted in rich soil, ready to grow. Wangari wanted to continue her education, but to do so she would have to leave her village and move to the capital city of Nairobi. Wangari had never been farther than her valley’s ridge. She was scared.\
 \
 (paragraph 9) “Go,” her mother said. She picked up a handful of earth and placed it gently into her daughter’s hand. “Where you go, we go.” . . .\
 \
 (paragraph 10) As graduation neared, Wangari told her friends she wanted to become a biologist.\
 \
 (paragraph 11) “Not many native women become biologists,” they told her.\
 \
 (paragraph 12) “I will,” she said.\
 \
 (paragraph 13) Wangari watched sadly as her government sold more and more land to big companies that cut down forests for timber and to clear land for coffee plantations. Native trees such as cedar and acacia vanished. Without trees, birds had no place to nest. Monkeys lost their swings. Tired mothers walked miles for firewood. . . .\
 \
 (paragraph 14) When Wangari visited her village she saw that the Kikuyu custom of not chopping down the mugumo trees had been lost. No longer held in place by tree roots, the soil streamed into the rivers. The water that had been used to grow maize, bananas, and sweet potatoes turned to mud and dried up. Many families went hungry.\
 \
 (paragraph 15) Wangari could not bear to think of the land being destroyed. Now married and the mother of three children, she worried about what would happen to the mothers and children who depended on the land.\
 \
 (paragraph 16) “We must do something,” Wangari said.\
 \
 (paragraph 17) Wangari had an idea as small as a seed but as tall as a tree that reaches for the sky. “Harabee! Let’s work together!” she said to her countrywomen—mothers like her. Wangari dug deep into the soil, a seedling by her side. “We must plant trees.” . . .\
 \
 (paragraph 18) Wangari traveled to villages, towns, and cities with saplings and seeds, shovels and hoes. At each place she went, women planted rows of trees that looked like green belts across the land. Because of this they started calling themselves the Green Belt Movement.\
 \
 (paragraph 19) “We might not change the big world but we can change the landscape of the forest,” she said.\
 \
 (paragraph 20) One tree turned to ten, ten to one hundred, one hundred to one million, all the way up to thirty million planted trees. Kenya grew green again. Birds nested in new trees. Monkeys swung on branches. Rivers filled with clean water. Wild figs grew heavy in mugumo branches.\
 \
 (paragraph 21) Mothers fed their children maize, bananas, and sweet potatoes until they could eat no more.\
How are the details in paragraphs 13 and 14 organized?\
(A) as a description of how animal habitats changed\
 (B) as an explanation of the solution to a problem in the environment\
 (C) as a comparison of the village before and after the government sold the land\
 (D) as a description of how a problem was caused in the area and its effects\

This story takes place in Japan. The narrator has just rented a new home on a small street named Lightning Alley.\
 \
 Excerpt from The Guest Cat\
 \
 by Takashi Hiraide\
 \
 (paragraph 1) The cat’s name was Chibi, which means “little one.” We could hear the boy’s particularly high-pitched voice calling the cat: “Chibi!” Then we’d hear the sound of the boy’s shoes running around outside, followed by the tinkling of the little bell announcing the cat’s arrival.\
 \
 (paragraph 2) Chibi was a jewel of a cat. Her pure white fur was mottled with several lampblack blotches containing just a bit of light brown. The sort of cat you might see just about anywhere in Japan, except she was especially slim and tiny.\
 \
 (paragraph 3) These were her individual characteristics—slim and small, with ears that stood out, tapering off beautifully at the tips, and often twitching. She would approach silently and undetected to rub up against one’s legs. At first I thought Chibi avoided me because I was not used to cats, but this seems not to have been the case. When a girl who often passed along Lightning Alley stopped and crouched to gaze at the cat, it did not run away. But as soon as she attempted to touch it, the cat quickly slipped off, avoiding contact at all costs. The cat’s manner of rejection was like cold, white light.\
 \
 (paragraph 4) Moreover, the cat rarely made a sound. As far as I remember, when it first appeared in the alley it made some sort of sound, but since then it had never let out a meow. It looked as if no matter how much time passed the cat was not going to let us hear its\
 voice. This seemed to be the message the cat was giving us.\
 \
 (paragraph 5) Another one of Chibi’s characteristics was that she changed the direction of her cautious attention frequently. This active behavior wasn’t limited to her kittenhood. Perhaps because she played alone most of the time in the expansive garden, she reacted strongly to insects and reptiles. And there were times when I could only conclude that she must be reacting to subtle changes in the wind and light, not detectable by humans. It may be that most cats share the same quickness, but even so, in Chibi’s case, it was acute—she was, after all, the cat of Lightning Alley. My wife got into the habit of pointing to the cat whenever it went by, extolling (extolling - praising) its virtues. . . .\
 \
 (paragraph 6) Chibi, who loved to play ball, gradually began to visit us on her own and would try and get us to play with her. She would step gingerly into the room and gaze intently at its occupants, then purposefully turn around and walk back out, as if to lead us to the garden. This process would be repeated until she got a response. Most of the time my wife would put down whatever she was doing, slip happily into her sandals and head outside.\
 \
 (paragraph 7) Having played to her heart’s content, Chibi would come inside and rest for a while. When she began to sleep on the sofa—like a talisman (talisman - an object thought to bring good luck) curled gently in the shape of a comma and dug up from a prehistoric archaeological site—a deep sense of happiness arrived, as if the house itself had dreamed this scene.\
 \
 (paragraph 8) Avoiding the prying eyes of the landlady, we began leaving it up to Chibi to come inside the house whenever she wanted—and with this new development I had begun little by little to understand cat lovers. Whether on TV or in all of the ubiquitous (ubiquitous - present everywhere) cat calendars, it seemed as if there was no cat comparable to her. But, though I had started to think of her as the best cat around, she was not really our cat.\
 \
 (paragraph 9) First we would hear the tinkling of the bell, and then she would appear, so we began to call her by the nickname “Tinkerbell.” Whenever we wanted her to come over, this name seemed to find itself on our lips.\
 \
 (paragraph 10) “I wonder where Tinkerbell is.” By the time my wife had gotten the words out of her mouth we’d hear the tinkling of Chibi’s bell. We’d realize that she was near at the point where, exiting the foyer next door (located at the second corner of Lightning Alley), Chibi would leap through the tear in the wire-mesh boundary of the property, dash along the side of the building, turn at the far end of the veranda, leap up onto the open area of the deck, and then, placing her front paws on the window frame at about the height of a human adult’s knee, stretch out her neck to peek inside.\
 \
 (paragraph 11) In winter she came inside. Little by little, through the crack in the partially opened window, her tendency to visit subtly developed; her appearances were repeated until, as if a silken opening in a fabric had been continuously moistened and stretched, Chibi had entered our lives. But at the same time—call it fate if you will—something else was closing in and pressing itself against that tendency.\
Which activity first leads Chibi to engage with the narrator and his wife?\
(A) sleeping on the sofa\
 (B) staying away from the landlady\
 (C) wanting to play ball\
 (D) being called by a nickname\

 I think, at last, it’s unsolvable,\
 that the only meaning it holds is told\
 (line 5) in the moments I feel on the verge\
 of understanding, and it turns me back.\
 \
 The pieces: so small, so many. How they\
 belong together is beyond me,\
 though early on my mind inclined\
 (line 10) toward an idyllic scene: a yellow field,\
 all jonquils (jonquils - a type of yellow daffodil), a sea, the wide horizon…\
 \
 The dog’s dish is empty. My wife and children\
 sleep. The house is hushed, except\
 for the stout hall clock that ticks its minutes.\
 (line 15) Here in my patch of lamplight, time\
 dawdles, waiting for me to catch up,\
 though a few small hairs on my wrist\
 have gone white, and evening’s blank encircles me.\
 \
 Who made this puzzle? If I sought him out\

 But the hour is late, my vision strained.\
 How could I look for him now, though he were\
 waiting for me, and knew me by name?\

Reading Comprehension Passage A\
 \
 Screeno\
 In the following passage, Cornelius Schmidt seeks refuge from a gloomy, rainy night by going to a movie. \
 \
 …At the door [of the theater] the uniformed ticket taker gave him a card on which was \
 printed a kind of checkerboard, having in each box a number. It was obviously the old game \
 of Lotto, the object being to get five numbers which were successive either horizontally or\
 vertically or in a diagonal. In the center, amid numbered boxes, was a box entitled\
 (line 5) GRATIS; (GRATIS - free, a space that could count as any number called) the management gave this box to the audience. …\
    The theatre fell into a semi-darkness, not the movie darkness, but one in which discreet\
 lights shone on both sides of the theatre and both sides of the stage. A white and pink\
 clockface flashed on the screen. It was, in fact, like a roulette wheel, and had numbers\
 running from 1 to 100. In the center was a pointer, which suddenly began to whirl furiously \
 (line 10) about the clockface, and then slowed down, and then stopped.\
    \"Ninety-nine!\" said the businesslike yet airy young man in an authoritative voice.\
 An usher wrote down the number upon a blackboard to the right of the screen. The pointer \
 spun again, at a tremendous pace, so that it was almost a moving blur for a moment, and\
 then clarified into its arrow-like straightness. The actual wheel was, of course, in the\
 (line 15) projection room.\
    \"Fifty-four!\" said the young master of ceremonies, simulating a dramatic tone.\
    \"SCREENO!\" cried a voice from the balcony in a mocking voice, while everyone\
 laughed, for obviously no one could have SCREENO as yet.\
    \"I am sorry, ladies and gentlemen,\" said the young man in an affable (affable - friendly) voice,\" but we will \
 (line 20) have to ask you not to be humorous about this. After all, money is involved, and there has\
 been much confusion in the past because various people insisted upon trying to be\
 funny.\"…\
    The pointer was revolving again. \"Thirty-nine!\" announced the young man. The\
 audience was not yet warmed up, because too few numbers had been called for anyone to \
 (line 25) be on the verge of winning. Cornelius, however, also had this third number and was pleased \
 no little by the course of events.\
    \"Forty-nine!\" announced the young man. …\
    \"Fourteen!\" cried the young man into the microphone which made his voice even more\
 official than otherwise. Cornelius did not have the number. He assured himself that the\
 (line 30) game was a fraud, that the management was obviously not going to permit anyone to win so \
 much money and that the whole business would obviously be controlled in the projection \
 room or by arranging the numbers on the cards. There was only one more chance, a drop\
 in the ocean. He slouched back in his seat, chiding himself for his great excitement. …\
    \"Twenty-five!\" the master of ceremonies called out.\
 (line 35)    \"Twenty-five! Twenty-five!\" said Cornelius to himself, and then, finding the number on\
 his card as the fifth consecutive horizontal number, he rose in his seat and shouted:\
    \"SCREENO!\" in a too loud voice which broke, and began to issue (to issue - to exit) from his aisle,\
 tripping over the feet of the people seated near him, some of whom were solicitous (solicitous - helpful) of his\
 walk, and eager to provide good advice as he passed. The attractiveness of the winner shone\
 (line 40) in him. …\
    An usher took his card, and checked it with the numbers on the blackboard. The young\
 man came over to oversee the usher. It seemed as if something was wrong, someone\
 had miscalculated, to look at the young man. The checking was done several times.\
 Very bureaucratic, said Cornelius to himself. Recovering, as the checkup proved that\
 (line 45) Cornelius had indeed won, he shook Cornelius’s hand and the whole theatre lighted up.\
    \"Lucky fellow,\" cried the balcony voice, amusing the audience again, by the envious\
 tone in his voice. …\
    The usher arrived with the money just as the persistent balcony voice called out,\
 \"Let’s go on with the show,\" and the audience began to clap again, wishing to have its\
 (line 50) chance at the other prizes.\
    But then, as the money was delivered to the young assistant manager, and he began\
 officiously to count it out, shuffle it, and arrange it, before paying Cornelius, a hoarse and \
 disused voice cried from the balcony:\
    \"SCREENO! SCREENO!\" …\
 (line 55)   \"SCREENO!\" came the voice again, this time nearer, as the new winner approached\
 the stairs from the balcony to the orchestra. The young assistant manager and the ushers \
 looked at each other in dismay. Something had obviously gone wrong, for usually no one\
 won the jackpot; two winners was inconceivable and would lead to bankruptcy. Someone\
 was going to lose his job because of this. …\
 (line 60)   \"My name is Casper Weingarten,\" said the old man, unasked, intruding himself upon\
 the huddle of the assistant manager and the ushers. He was very nervous, very excited.\
 \"I am a musician,\" he said, but no one paid any attention to him, except Cornelius.\
    And then the young assistant manager came over to the old man and, holding the card\
 up, showed him that he had not won, that he had mistaken a 7 for a 1 because the print had\
 (line 65) been on the left-hand side. \"Perhaps you’ll win one of the other prizes,\" he said,\
 courteously, \"since you already have four numbers in a row.\" …\
    Cornelius came over to look into the matter for himself. He took the card in his hand\
 and looked at the number in question. The old man looked at him, and then turned to the\
 assistant manager, saying:\
 (line 70)   \"Give me my money! I have won!\" …\
    \"Look here,\" said Cornelius tactfully to the assistant manager, \"it seems to me that you\
 can only assume that this is a 1. The blur is too faint to make it a seven.\"\
    \"I know it is a 7,\" said the assistant manager angrily, and when he said that, Cornelius\
 recognized immediately that he was so sure because the cards had been prepared in\
 (line 75) advance to obviate the possibility of two winners of the jackpot, or even one. Seeing this,\
 Cornelius began to feel sick and angry, as he always did when confronted with fraud or\
 cheating.\
    \"All my life I’ve been cheated,\" said the old man, wringing his hands. \"Give me my\
 money.\" An usher took his arm, as if to lead him from the stage, but the assistant manager\
 (line 80) deterred him, unwilling as yet to resort to force. …\
    \"My good man,\" said the assistant manager, \"Your hard luck is not my fault, nor this\
 theatre’s responsibility. Please do not cause a disturbance. Now if both of you will leave the\
 stage, we can go on with the other prizes and with the show.\"\
    In answer, the old man sat down upon the stage, looking grotesque there, with his head\
 (line 85) turned up. \"I will sit here until I am paid,\" he said tearfully. …\
    But the audience was won over, for no one wished to lose his chance at the remaining\
 $50. There was a murmuring of voices and someone cried out:\
    \"Go home and give us a chance.\" …\
    \"Call a cop,\" said another. …\
 (line 90)   Cornelius meditated with himself for a moment and then said: \"Listen, I will give you\
 half of the jackpot. Come on before you’re arrested.\" …\
    \"No,\" said Weingarten, \"I don’t want your money. I want mine. Give me my money,\"\
 he said towards the assistant manager.\
    Cornelius considered matters with himself again and came to a decision. Easy come,\
 (line 95) easy go, he said to himself, and then he told the old musician that he could have the whole\
 jackpot. The manager protested immediately, but Cornelius took the bills from his pocket\
 and began to count them out and give them to the musician, who accepted them with\
 a guilty look and trembling hands.\
    The audience saw what was happening and applauded vigorously, not because it was\
 (line 100) genuinely moved, but because it felt that it ought to applaud. Such applause is heard at\
 public gatherings when an abstraction too vacuous (vacuous - insincere) is mentioned or tribute is paid to a man\
 long dead. The assistant manager, trying to move in on Cornelius’s credit, came over to\
 shake hands with Cornelius. Cornelius, tempted to reject the proffered hand, accepted it\
 because he wished to cause no further disturbance.\
 (line 105)   The old man had risen and come over to Cornelius.\
    \"Thank you very much for your kindness,\" he said in the estranged voice of those who\
 have been weeping or overexcited.\
    \"Not at all,\" said Cornelius formally. Both descended from the stage together. …\

Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen – 1789\
 \
 Articles:\
 1. Men are born and remain free and equal in rights. Social distinctions may be founded only upon the general good.\
 \
 2. The aim of all political association is the preservation of the natural and imprescriptible [inalienable] rights of man. These rights are liberty, property, security, and resistance to oppression. . . .\
 \
 4. Liberty consists in the freedom to do everything which injures no one else; hence the exercise of the natural rights of each man has no limits except those which assure to the other members of the society the enjoyment of the same rights. These limits can only be determined by law. . . .\
 \
 6. Law is the expression of the general will. Every citizen has a right to participate personally, or through his representative, in its foundation. It must be the same for all, whether it protects or punishes. All citizens, being equal in the eyes of the law, are equally eligible to all dignities and to all public positions and occupations, according to their abilities, and without distinction except that of their virtues and talents. . . .\

 Declaration of the Rights of Woman and Female Citizen – 1791\
 \
 FIRST ARTICLE\
 Woman is born free and remains equal to man in rights. Social distinctions can only be founded on common service.\
 \
 II\
 The aim of all political associations is to preserve the natural and inalienable rights\
 of Woman and Man: these are the rights to liberty, ownership, safety and, above all, resistance to oppression. . . .\
 \
 IV\
 Liberty and justice lie in rendering everything which belongs to others as of right. Thus the exercise of woman’s natural rights has no limit other than the perpetual tyranny of man’s opposing them: these limits must be reformed by the laws of nature and reason. . . .\
 \
 VI\
 The Law must be the expression of the general will; all citizens, female and male, should concur [agree] personally or through their representatives in its formation, and it must be the same for all. All citizens, being equal in its eyes, must be equally eligible to all honours, positions and public posts according to their abilities, and with no other distinction other than those of their virtues and talents. . . .\

Excerpt from Snowflake Bentley\
 by Jacqueline Briggs Martin\
 \
 (paragraph 1) In the days when farmers worked with ox and sled and cut the dark with lantern light, there lived a boy who loved snow more than anything in the world. Willie Bentley’s happiest days were snowstorm days. He watched snowflakes on his mittens, on the dried grass of Vermont farm fields, on the dark metal handle of the barn door. He said snow was as beautiful as butterflies, or apple blossoms.\
 \
 (paragraph 2) He could net butterflies and show them to his older brother, Charlie. He could pick apple blossoms and take them to his mother. But he could not share snowflakes because he could not save them.\
 \
 (paragraph 3) When his mother gave him an old microscope, he used it to look at flowers, raindrops, and blades of grass. Best of all, he used it to look at snow. While other children built forts and pelted snowballs at roosting crows, Willie was catching snowflakes. Day after stormy day he studied the icy crystals.\
 \
 (paragraph 4) Their intricate patterns were even more beautiful than he had imagined. He expected to find whole flakes that were the same, that were copies of each other. But he never did. Willie decided he must find a way to save snowflakes so others could see their wonderful designs. For three winters he tried drawing snow crystals. They always melted before he could finish.\
 \
 (paragraph 5) When he was sixteen, Willie read of a camera with its own microscope. “If I had that camera I could photograph snowflakes,” he told his mother. Willie’s mother knew that he would not be happy until he could share what he had seen.\
 \
 (paragraph6) “Fussing with snow is just foolishness,” his father said. Still, he loved his son. When Willie was seventeen his parents spent their savings and bought the camera. It was taller than a newborn calf, and cost as much as his father’s herd of ten cows. Willie was sure it was the best of all cameras.\
 \
 (paragraph 7) Even so his first pictures were failures—no better than shadows. Yet he would not quit. Mistake by mistake, snowflake by snowflake, Willie worked through every storm. Winter ended, the snow melted, and he had no good pictures. He waited for another season of snow. One day, in the second winter, he tried a new experiment. And it\
 worked! Willie had figured out how to photograph snowflakes! “Now everyone can see the great beauty in a tiny crystal,” he said.\
 \
 (paragraph 8) But in those days, no one cared. Neighbors laughed at the idea of photographing snow. “Snow in Vermont is as common as dirt,” they said. “We don’t need pictures.” Willie said the photographs would be his gift to the world. While other farmers sat by the fire or rode to town with horse and sleigh, Willie studied snowstorms. He stood at the shed door and held out a black tray to catch the flakes.\
 \
 (paragraph 9) When he found only jumbled, broken crystals, he brushed the tray clean with a turkey feather and held it out again. He waited hours for just the right crystal and didn’t notice the cold. If the shed were warm the snow would melt. If he breathed on the black tray the snow would melt. If he twitched a muscle as he held the snow crystal on the long wood pick the snowflake would break. He had to work fast or the snowflake would evaporate before he could slide it into place and take its picture. Some winters he was able to make only a few dozen good pictures. Some winters he made hundreds. . . .\
 \
 (paragraph 10) But his snow crystal pictures were always his favorites. He gave copies away or sold them for a few cents. He made special pictures as gifts for birthdays. He held evening slide shows on the lawns of his friends. Children and adults sat on the grass and watched while Willie projected his slides onto a sheet hung over a clothesline.\
 \
 (paragraph 11) He wrote about snow and published his pictures in magazines. He gave speeches about snow to faraway scholars and neighborhood skywatchers. “You are doing great work,” said a professor from Wisconsin. The little farmer came to be known as the world’s expert on snow, “the Snowflake Man.” But he never grew rich. He spent every\
 penny on his pictures. Willie said there were treasures in snow. “I can’t afford to miss a single snowstorm,” he told a friend. “I never know when I will find some wonderful prize.”\

 . . .The poor harvest could not have come at a worse moment. France had entered into an unfavorable trade treaty with England in 1776. The pact reduced import duties on English goods, the notion being to encourage French manufacturers to mechanize production in response to enhanced competition. A flood of cheap imports from across the Channel overwhelmed the cloth industry. Cloth production alone fell by 50 percent between 1787 and 1789. The 5,672 looms in Amiens and Abbeville in 1785 were down to 2,204 by 1789. Thirty-six thousand people were put out of work, throwing many poor workers onto city streets at a time when hungry peasants were flocking to urban centers in search of food. The rural crisis might have been short-lived had not urban unemployment mushroomed at the same time. In Paris, the government subsidized bread prices out of fear of the mobs, but to no avail. The situation was soon out of control. . . .\

A major environmental concern in urban areas is pollution produced by automobiles. Fluids, such as oil and gasoline, may leak out of vehicles and end up in lakes, streams, and rivers. One reason why scientists are concerned about this type of pollution is that\
(1) the presence of these fluids in waterways could make them uninhabitable for aquatic organisms and reduce water supplies for humans\
 (2) the addition of these fluids will cause an increase in the levels of lakes and rivers, possibly causing flooding in nearby areas\
 (3) these fluids increase the rate of photosynthesis in aquatic plants, reducing the amount of O2 available for other life forms\
 (4) the addition of these chemicals to waterways reduces air quality, which would lead to increased respiratory diseases and global warming\

 Excerpt from Gregor and the Sheep\
 by Toby Rosenstrauch\
 \
 (paragraph 1) In a valley in the highlands of Scotland, there once lived a young tenant farmer, Gregor, and his widowed mother. Although they worked hard, they could never accumulate enough money to buy the flock of sheep they longed to have, for their small parcel of land produced only modest amounts of oats and barley. To make matters\
 worse, MacTavish, the owner of this and many other crofts, always found reasons not to pay the farmers all they had earned. . . .\
 \
 crofts = small farms\
 \
 (paragraph 2) When he opened the door each morning and looked out, he saw MacTavish’s house on top of a mountain, a magnificent stone mansion surrounded by red, pink, and violet rhododendrons. Gregor often climbed the slope and stood outside the iron gates, wondering what fine furnishings and delicious foods lay within. Neighbors claimed\
 that MacTavish owned many houses and even kept a chest of gems under his bed. As Gregor, his mother, and their neighbors grew gaunt and pale with hard work and not enough food, they railed against MacTavish, who had swindled all of them at one time or another.\
 \
 swindled = cheated or tricked\
 \
 (paragraph 3) One day, as Gregor listened to the bagpipe music that drifted from the open windows of MacTavish’s mansion, he had an idea. That night, when his mother was asleep, he emptied the jug that held their money and counted it. After putting back a few coins for food, he put the rest in his pocket. The next morning, he hurried to the market, where he went from farmer to farmer, asking the prices of sheep for sale.\
 Gregor found many handsome animals, but they were all too expensive. When he reached a stall with scrawny and sickly sheep, the owner beckoned to him. . . .\
 \
 (paragraph 4) Gregor shook his head and began to walk away. The man grabbed his sleeve and whispered in his ear, “This one will make her owner rich!” Gregor examined the old sheep with spindly legs and dirty, unkempt wool—the worst of the lot. “If she will make me rich,” said Gregor, “how is it that she has not done so for you?”\
 \
 (paragraph 5) The man paused, thinking. “I have not had her long enough!”\
 \
 (paragraph 6) “Nonsense,” said Gregor, but he gave the man his money and led the pitiful animal home.\
 \
 (paragraph 7) When his mother saw what he had bought with their money, she burst into tears. “My foolish son, what have you done? Now we will starve, and no one will help us!”\
 \
 (paragraph 8) “Do as I say, Mother, and we will be rich. I promise.”\
 \
 (paragraph 9) She wanted to believe him. Wiping her eyes with her ragged sleeve, she asked what he wanted her to do.\
 \
 (paragraph 10) “Go to market and tell everyone that your son has a sheep that will make whoever owns her rich,” said Gregor. . . .\
 \
 (paragraph 11) One morning, a carriage arrived. Two servants opened the door and a stout, welldressed gentleman emerged. His Tartan kilt was made of the finest wool, his ascot was pure silk, and his shoes had silver buckles. On his fat fingers were eight gold rings, and his pomaded hair glistened in the sun. It was MacTavish!\
 \
 Tartan kilt = traditional clothing worn by Scottish Highlanders\
 \
 ascot = a type of necktie\
 \
 (paragraph 12) Gregor bowed as if to royalty. MacTavish looked at him sternly. “I have come to rid you of the unfortunate sheep that everyone is talking about,” said MacTavish, opening his sporran. “I can pay your price and I will have her, even though she has done nothing for you, I see.” MacTavish sneered at Gregor.\
 \
 sporran = a small bag worn at the waist for holding personal items\
 \
 (paragraph 13) Gregor hugged Dear One. “I will not sell her to you!”\
 \
 (paragraph 14) ”At that, MacTavish, whose servants were helping him into his carriage, turned and marched back. “I will pay anything,” he said. “Name the price.”\
 \
 (paragraph 15) Gregor was ready. “That,” he said, pointing up to the mansion above them. “I will have the dwelling and everything in it—furniture, utensils, even the chest of gems under your bed.”\
 \
 (paragraph 16) “Done,” said MacTavish.\
 \
 (paragraph 17) The next day, Gregor and his mother moved into the mansion that had once belonged to MacTavish, and MacTavish brought Dear One to the market so that all might see he could indeed own anything he wanted. Then MacTavish and the sheep rode away in his carriage to another of his houses in a valley beyond the mountains.\
 \
 (paragraph 18) After months had passed and the sheep had done nothing to increase MacTavish’s riches, he realized he had been swindled. Furious beyond speech, he returned to the mansion, but Gregor would not open the gates.\
 \
 (paragraph 19) “I have been cheated!” shouted MacTavish.\
 \
 (paragraph 20) “You have not been cheated,” said Gregor. “I was the owner of the sheep, and she has made me rich, hasn’t she?”\
 \
 (paragraph 21) “Yes, but . . . ,” sputtered MacTavish.\
 \
 (paragraph 22) “Then you got what you paid for.” Gregor turned and walked away.\
 \
 (paragraph 21) Soon afterward, Gregor sold the chest of gems and bought the huge flock of sheep he and his mother had always wanted. He shared the rest of his fortune with the other poor families of the valley who had been cheated by MacTavish.\
How do paragraphs 1 and 23 relate to each other?\
(A) They show the change in Gregor’s life during the story.\
 (B) They show what Gregor has learned in the story.\
 (C) They show how MacTavish changes in the story.\
 (D) They show the growth of MacTavish’s fortune during the story.\

Excerpt from Wheels of Change: How Women Rode the Bicycle to Freedom (With a Few Flat Tires Along the Way)\
 by Sue Macy\
 \
 (paragraph 1) Women’s rights crusader Elizabeth Cady Stanton was in her eighties during the\
 heyday of the bicycle, and no evidence exists to show that she actually ever rode one.\
 But there was no better or more eloquent advocate for women and the wheel. In 1895,\
 Stanton contributed an article to the American Wheelman celebrating this “wonderful\
 new style of locomotion.” In the article, titled “The Era of the Bicycle,” she pointed out\
 that cycling was increasing people’s mobility, eliminating the cost of feeding and\
 housing horses, and encouraging the building of good roads. However, she saved her\
 greatest praise for the bicycle’s effects on women. “The bicycle,” she wrote, “will inspire\
 women with more courage, self-respect and self-reliance and make the next generation\
 more vigorous of mind and of body; for feeble mothers do not produce great\
 statesmen, scientists and scholars.”\
 (paragraph 2) For all the practical benefits of the two-wheeler, the fact is that it brought about a\
 cosmic shift in women’s private and public lives. With the rise of industry and the\
 move from a rural to an urban economy in the 19th century, American women had\
 become increasingly confined to their homes. Young girls could play outside, but when\
 they matured, their freedom of movement was greatly restricted. “At sixteen years of\
 age, I was enwrapped in the long skirts that impeded every footstep,” remembered\
 Frances Willard, who in 1895 wrote a best-selling account of how she learned to ride a\
 bicycle at age 53. “I have detested walking and felt with a certain noble disdain that the\
 conventions of life had cut me off from what . . . had been one of life’s sweetest joys.”\
 (paragraph 3) While wealthier women were saddled with long skirts and restrictive corsets, those\
 who were less well off worked anonymously in mills and factories. All in all, the result\
 was the same. Except in a few instances, the public image of America was male.\
 Politicians, soldiers, business leaders, and even the leading athletes in the new sports of\
 baseball and football were all men. But the bicycle changed that. Suddenly, women\
 were leaving their homes to cycle and socialize on country roads and city streets.\
 Bicycle racers such as Louise Armaindo and Frankie Nelson had their exploits splashed\
 all over the papers. Bicycle manufacturers, intent on mining an untapped market,\
 showed female models in their advertisements. Thanks to the wheel, women were\
 starting to be seen and heard in public life.\
 (paragraph 4) It was not a stretch for some cyclists to see the possibility of a larger role for women\
 in the world. When she conquered the wheel, Frances Willard was a former university\
 president and the longtime president of the Woman’s Christian Temperance Union,\
 which fought to prohibit the use of alcoholic beverages and to win women the right to\
 vote. Willard saw parallels between learning to ride and learning to live. “I began to feel\
 that myself plus the bicycle equaled myself plus the world, upon whose spinning wheel\
 we must all learn to ride,” she wrote. “He who succeeds, or, to be more exact in handing\
 over my experience, she who succeeds in gaining the mastery of [a bicycle], will gain\
 the mastery of life.”\
 (paragraph 5) For decades, Willard, along with Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Susan B. Anthony, and\
 many others, had been working toward increased political and economic rights for\
 women. Now the bicycle brought a taste of independence to women on a very personal\
 level, and some of them took the opportunity to express their discontent with old\
 traditions and expectations. In August 1895, a cyclist named Ann Strong caused a stir\
 when she compared the value of a bicycle to that of a husband in the Minneapolis\
 Tribune. “I can’t see but that a wheel is just as good company as most husbands,” she\
 declared. “I would as lief (lief: happily) talk to one inanimate object as another; and I’d a great deal\
 rather talk to one that can’t answer than one that won’t.” Strong then contrasted the joy\
 of cycling with the challenges of raising a family. “You can make your wheel tidy over\
 night,” she said, “and it never kicks off its shoes the very last minute, and never smears\
 itself with molasses. When you are ready you can start. No little elbows are stuck in\
 your ribs; there is no wiggling; screams at the cars or at the candy stores. You glide\
 along, silently, smoothly, swiftly.”\
 (paragraph 6) Some stated the liberating effects of the bicycle with less sarcasm. “The bicycle has\
 brought to women a healthful, wholesome means of securing a degree of freedom and\
 independence that no amount of discussion regarding ‘women’s rights’ would ever\
 have produced,” wrote the L.A.W. Bulletin and Good Roads magazine in 1898.\
 Meanwhile, Munsey’s Magazine assessed the impact of the wheel on women in a\
 special bicycle-themed issue. “If she has ridden her bicycle into new fields, becoming in\
 the process a new creature, it has been gradually and unconsciously,” the editors wrote.\
 (paragraph 7) “She did not have to be born again in some mysterious fashion, becoming a strange\
 creature, a ‘new woman.’ She is more like the ‘eternal feminine,’ who has taken on\
 wings, and who is using them with an ever increasing delight in her new power.”\
 Indeed, many bicycle companies at home and abroad did put wings on the women in\
 their advertisements, emphasizing that they had taken flight.\
 (paragraph 8) Not all publications treated the emergence of the “new woman” with the same level\
 of approval. Some mocked her, while others just seemed baffled by her. Her new way of\
 dressing, in bloomers or divided skirts or skirts with shortened hems, certainly\
 disturbed the old social order, but so did her confidence and daring. These traits led\
 commentators to worry that the differences between the sexes were being blurred, a\
 fear that was reinforced as the four newest states—Wyoming, Colorado, Utah, and\
 Idaho—granted women the right to vote in the 1890s. Would the bicycle help bring\
 about a new kind of equality between men and women? Elizabeth Cady Stanton and\
 her colleagues certainly hoped so. At any rate, the image of a female cyclist quickly\
 became associated with efforts to win more rights for women.\

(A) It marks a transition.\
 (B) It introduces an example.\
 (C) It refines a previous statement.\

What Do Flies Think About?\
 From Ideas & Discoveries Magazine\
 \
 It seems unbelievable, but an insect’s brain is more brilliant than any supercomputer.\
 That’s why researchers are studying flies and bees to understand their cognition. Food for\
 thought . . .\
 Though it may seem like a mundane question, there is serious science behind it: Why\
 (line 5) is a common housefly able to land on a ceiling? After all, the insect flies with its feet down\
 when it’s below the ceiling, yet, in the blink of an eye, the fly is suddenly perched with feet\
 upward. The explanation for the fly’s aerial feat is important because it can reveal a lot\
 about what the insect’s brain is capable of: Regardless of how the fly manages the landing,\
 its tiny brain (which consists of only 100,000 nerve cells) has to go into high gear to carry\
 (line 10) it out. For a long time, scientists believed the flies turn around in flight much like a fighter\
 pilot performs loops. This would require them to first “visualize” a mental rotation—in\
 other words, to plan the loop beforehand.\
 It was only recently that researchers discovered how a fly actually lands on a ceiling.\
 Using a high-speed camera, they discovered that flies don’t perform a loop after all.\
 (line 15) Instead, they stretch out their front legs over their head and toward the ceiling. As soon as\
 the legs make contact with the ceiling, the fly swings its body around 180 degrees like a\
 gymnast on a horizontal bar. Then it simply attaches itself to the ceiling with all its legs.\
 This precision landing requires perfect coordination of all its muscles. The fly’s swinging\
 motion also needs to be calculated, which means information shoots through its body in\
 (line 20) the space of milliseconds. Not even an autopilot system controlled by a high-tech\
 computer could carry out such a maneuver.\
 Bees are a favorite experimental creature for researchers because they are easy to breed\
 and are considered the “Einsteins” of the insect world. These striped geniuses perform\
 intellectual feats that cannot be taken for granted, even among mammals. Bees can count,\
 (line 25) distinguish between objects like humans and dogs, recognize complex shapes, learn things,\
 navigate across great distances and remember their routes, and return to their hives and\
 tell other bees exactly where the tastiest flowers are. Compare that with the difficulties\
 humans can have when finding their way around an unfamiliar city without a map—not\
 to mention having to describe to friends the route they took. “Brain size is not necessarily\
 (line 30) an indicator of intelligence,” says bee researcher Lars Chittka at Queen Mary, University of\
 London. “Larger brains usually utilize the same circuits over and over again. This might\
 make for more detailed thinking or remembering, but it doesn’t guarantee the thoughts or\
 memories will be better.”\
 Bees are also social insects that create complex colony systems and display a high\
 (line 35) degree of social behavior. The idea of life in a group is firmly rooted in their brains—\
 which is what makes bees so interesting to brain researchers. We, too, are social creatures,\
 after all, and scientists suspect that certain neuronal circuits have changed very little over\
 the course of evolution. In other words, bee brains could provide us with information on\
 nerve connections that will help us better understand our own human nature and how we\
 (line 40) think.\
 Researchers already know that insects living in groups need to have more computing\
 power in their head. This is illustrated by the fact that all social insects have a larger brain\
 than their loner counterparts. A key factor in this discovery was a study conducted by\
 biologists at a Smithsonian lab in Panama. The country is home to a bee species that\
 (line 45) contains some members that live alone and others that form groups. The biologists\
 discovered that the loner bees also had a smaller brain. So it appears that a larger brain is\
 a consequence of group living. The same phenomenon is even more pronounced among\
 several species of locusts that begin life alone and later join up to form giant swarms: As\
 soon as they get together, their brains begin to grow by one-third. It’s likely they need to\
 (line 50) possess greater thinking capacity in order to compete with rivals in the swarm. It’s also\
 likely that flying and communicating in a swarm is more difficult than doing those things\
 alone. The biologists still don’t know how locusts get their brains to grow. The\
 explanation, should it be found, might be of interest to medical researchers looking into\
 treatments for paralysis or strokes. In any case, the researchers have found substances in\
 (line 55) the locusts’ brain that are extremely effective at killing bacteria. These substances are not\
 related to any known antibiotics, so they could possibly pave the way for new medications\
 in the future.\
 Such discoveries are definitely pointing scientists in a new direction. However,\
 practically no insect brain researcher has gone as far as Atsushi Takashima at the Tokyo\
 (line 60) Institute of Technology in Japan. Takashima has inserted electrodes into the brains of male\
 moths that he then uses as control units for a robot. Whenever the moth-machine hybrid\
 catches the scent of a female moth, it begins to search for the source. “Chemical\
 substances do not spread out uniformly in air,” Takashima explains. “So even though their\
 concentrations increase as you get closer to their source, the effects of wind and air\
 (line 65) currents make an analysis extremely difficult. But thanks to evolution, insect brains have\
 developed techniques to get around this problem.” Takashima’s research has significant\
 applications: His goal is to create robots that can sniff out explosives or dangerous\
 chemicals in the air and locate their source. One day a processor will control such robots,\
 but for now, a moth’s brain is far superior to any supercomputer on the market.\

Reading Comprehension Passage B\
 \
 View with a Grain of Sand\
 \
 We call it a grain of sand\
 but it calls itself neither grain nor sand.\
 It does just fine without a name,\
 whether general, particular,\
 (line 5) permanent, passing,\
 incorrect or apt.\
 \
 Our glance, our touch mean nothing to it.\
 It doesn’t feel itself seen and touched.\
 And that it fell on the windowsill\
 (line 10) is only our experience, not its.\
 For it it’s no different than falling on anything else\
 with no assurance that it’s finished falling\
 or that it’s falling still.\
 \
 The window has a wonderful view of a lake\
 (line 15) but the view doesn’t view itself.\
 It exists in this world\
 colorless, shapeless,\
 soundless, odorless, and painless.\
 \
 The lake’s floor exists floorlessly\
 (line 20) and its shore exists shorelessly.\
 Its water feels itself neither wet nor dry\
 and its waves to themselves are neither singular nor plural.\
 They splash deaf to their own noise\
 on pebbles neither large nor small.\
 \
 (line 25) And all this beneath a sky by nature skyless\
 in which the sun sets without setting at all\
 and hides without hiding behind an unminding cloud.\
 The wind ruffles it, its only reason being\
 that it blows.\
 \
 (line 30) A second passes.\
 A second second.\
 A third.\
 But they’re three seconds only for us.\
 \
 Time has passed like a courier with urgent news.\
 (line 35) But that’s just our simile.\
 The character’s invented, his haste is make-believe,\
 his news inhuman.\
 \
 —Wislawa Szymborska\
 from Polish Poetry of the Last Two Decades of Communist Rule, \
 translated by Stanislaw Bara´nczak and Clare Cavanagh \
 Northwestern University Press, 1991\
The purpose of lines 14 through 18 is to present\
(1) a contrast with human reliance on the senses\
 (2) a focus on the complexity of natural events\
 (3) an emphasis on human need for physical beauty\
 (4) an appreciation for the role of nature in everyday life\

 Mrs. Majeska and the Lost Gloves\
 \
 by Ethel Pochocki\
 \
 (paragraph 1) One crisp fall morning, Mrs. Majeska woke up with a craving for sauerkraut. It was so strong, she could smell it, she could taste it, and she knew she must have it for supper. So she put on her walking shoes, picked up her tub with a lid and a handle, and went into town to buy some.\
 \
 sauerkraut = chopped, pickled cabbage\
 \
  (paragraph 2) She walked briskly, enjoying the wind messing up her hair and the parade of dried leaves dancing ahead of her. It was a glorious day, and the thought of sauerkraut for supper, with a bit of apple and onion and sausage, made her want to dance along with the leaves.\
 \
 (paragraph 3) But suddenly she stopped. In the road there was a glove, a small black glove, the ﬁngers still plump, as if it had just left its owner’s hand. It was out of place in the middle of the road.\
 \
 (paragraph 4) Poor thing, thought Mrs. Majeska. I cannot leave it there. She picked it up quickly— a logging truck was coming—and laid it on the grass. She felt sorry for its owner, who now had only one glove. What good was one glove?\
 \
 (paragraph 5) On the way home from the store, she walked on the other side of the road, the sauerkraut sloshing inside the tub. A cluster of children came toward her, laughing and shouting to one another as they took turns kicking something in the dust. Finally they tired of it and ran off past Mrs. Majeska.\
 \
 (paragraph 6) She looked down at the sorry thing they had been kicking. It was another black glove, of the same size and shape as the one she had rescued. She examined it—yes, it was the mate to the other!\
 \
 (paragraph 7) Mrs. Majeska hesitated, then continued walking. It was only a glove, after all, not a child or a kitten or a wallet. Suddenly she stopped, turned around, and walked back to the crumpled bit of cloth. She picked it up, shook it out, and brushed off the dirt. It looked almost as good as new.\
 \
 (paragraph 8) With the glove in one hand and the tub of sauerkraut in the other, she strode down the road to where the other glove still lay in the grass. She placed its mate beside it, satisﬁed that they were now together. For what good was one glove without the other?\
 \
 (paragraph 9) A boy whizzed by on a bike and looked at her. Two old ladies, arm in arm, marched toward her on their way to the post ofﬁce. Mrs. Maj eska bent down and pretended to tie her Shoelaces, for she felt foolish to be caught in the act of reuniting a pair of gloves.\
 \
 (paragraph 10) That night, after a supper as delicious as she had imagined it, Mrs. Majeska sat in her rocker and thought about the gloves. She wished she had brought them home to use for herself. Their owner had probably already given them up for lost. The next morning,\
 after she had her coffee and read the newspaper, she decided to go back and get the gloves. But they were gone.\
 \
 (paragraph 11) Mrs. Majeska was mystiﬁed. Who—beside herself—would want a pair of gloves lying by the side of the road? Perhaps the owner had retraced her steps and rejoiced in ﬁnding them? Or maybe a housewife on a cleaning binge had used them to polish the stove? Or maybe a puppy needed something to chew on? Or a squirrel, to line its nest for winter?\
 \
 (paragraph 12) Mrs. Majeska would never know, but as long as she did not know, she would believe in a happy ending. No matter what their fate, the gloves were together, and that was all that mattered.\
Based on paragraphs 5 and 6, which sentence best contrasts Mrs. Majeska and the children?\
(A) Mrs. Majeska wants to clean the glove but the children do not.\
 (B) Mrs. Majeska is sorry for the glove owner but the children are not.\
 (C) Mrs. Majeska is happy to see the glove while the children are not.\
 (D) Mrs. Majeska understands the value of the glove while the children do not.\

The Diving Horse\
 by John B. Abbott, Jr.\
 \
 Fall of 1959. That was the year Fidel Castro seized power in Cuba; Alaska and Hawaii\
 joined the Union as our 49th and 50th states, respectively; and Gunsmoke reigned as the\
 top TV series. Charlton Heston collected an Academy Award for Ben-Hur, and Leon Uris’s\
 Exodus topped the reading lists. In Garwood, New Jersey, a child picked up his favorite\
 (line 5) Golden Books (Golden Books were known as Little Golden Books, a popular series of children’s books that had gold-foil bindings.) and stood outside of his parents’ apartment building, waiting for the\
 school bus. What a sight: a chubby boy in black high-top Keds, jeans, and a flannel shirt,\
 patiently waiting and watching for the bus that, when it finally did rumble down Willow\
 Avenue, passed him by. The driver didn’t think to stop, which made perfect sense since\
 her route schedule didn’t include three-year-olds—not even three-year-old me.\
 (line 10) “The bus didn’t stop for me,” I complained to my mother that day.\
 “Oh, really?” she calmly replied. Later she would say that the only surprise was\
 the age at which I wanted to start going to school. But it shouldn’t have surprised her\
 really, because as the son of a pair of avid readers, I grew up in a house abundant with\
 opportunities to read and write. Newspapers, magazines, television, and radio were\
 (line 15) always available.\
 When I finally reached school age and the bus did stop, high drama and adventure\
 made up most of my extracurricular reading. I would read and reread Classics Illustrated\
 comics, and authors like Daniel Defoe, Mark Twain, Arthur Conan Doyle, Washington\
 Irving, Edgar Rice Burroughs, and Frank W. Dixon. I also enjoyed Superman and Batman\
 (line 20) comic books and even went through a MAD magazine phase. Sometimes Mom had to\
 chase me out of the house after school to play, because I would have rather just stayed in\
 my room and read.\
 I wasn’t much on writing until I was enrolled in a Catholic school, St. Bernard’s.\
 There, the nuns were stereotypically tough but thorough educators. In third grade, I\
 (line 25) labored long and hard with Sister Mary, and while it was her thoroughness that led to my\
 discovering that I loved to write, it was a horse—the Diving Horse of Atlantic City—that\
 sparked a lifetime passion for writing.\
 At the beginning of that school year, Sister Mary had assigned to us the ubiquitous\
 essay about summer vacation. That summer, my family had taken a day trip to the\
 (line 30) original Steel Pier in Atlantic City to see the famous Diving Horse. How my parents\
 learned of the horse, I don’t know, but as a family that took all its vacations by automobile,\
 no doubt they were alert for local-yet-unusual attractions. Atlantic City must have been\
 appealing; in the 1960s, there were no casinos or nightlife per se—unless you count Frank\
 Sinatra, Jr.—but the town was mostly known for its family-oriented amusements and the\
 (line 35) tradition of Bert Parks crooning his welcome to Miss America. But for us, Bert paled in\
 comparison to the Diving Horse. So off we went in the white ’64 Pontiac to climb aboard\
 carnival rides and eat hamburgers.\
 Thinking back on that day, I remember the windburn I got on my forearms from the\
 cool salty breeze off the Atlantic—a first for me. And to this day, I can’t go to the Jersey\
 (line 40) Shore without bringing home a box of fresh saltwater taffy.\
 But above all, I remember anxiously getting bleacher seats to see the Diving Horse. As\
 we took our seats, the horse, with a fellow named Arnette Webster (The author’s recollection of the diver appears to be inaccurate. Arnette French, a woman who performed in horse diving shows, stopped performing in 1935.) (clad in a rubber wet\
 suit) on its back, was about to jump from a platform roughly 30 feet high into a pool. I\
 recall staring at the odd sight of a horse standing as calmly as you please on a platform\
 (line 45) above a pool just like the kind I swam in at my Aunt Anne and Uncle Leo’s house. To a\
 recorded drumroll and cymbal crash, Webster urged the horse forward, and the two fell\
 through space to make the biggest splash I’d ever seen—even bigger than the cannonballs\
 my uncle could make in his own pool! Wow! And then both horse and rider surfaced,\
 though for the life of me, I can’t recall how they got out of the pool.\
 (line 50) So two months later, when Sister Mary gave us the essay assignment, it was easy . . . as\
 easy as falling into a pool.\
 Looking at the Diving Horse essay some 40 years later, it’s apparent how much I must\
 have enjoyed writing about the experience. I put a lot of energy into trying to describe the\
 windburn, the taffy, and the horse, which, to my eight-year-old eyes, must have been\
 (line 55) suitable for a Valkyrie to ride. But in that essay, I did something that I imagine no other\
 child in the class did: I ended my piece with a rhetorical question. I wrote, “How would\
 you like to go to Atlantic City?”\
 Small as that detail was, Sister Mary must have noticed it. And she must have\
 encouraged me to keep writing, because with that essay, I learned something about myself.\
 (line 60) I learned that I loved to write.\
 It was at that age, as my father has confirmed, that I started to write stories, not just\
 read them. I soon took to writing as I had taken to reading. I wrote about monsters,\
 superheroes, and what could pass for a fourth-grader’s version of a mystery. Superman\
 never had it so easy foiling the best-laid plans of Lex Luthor, and my detectives—not as\
 (line 65) articulate as Sherlock Holmes, but as savvy—somehow always managed to catch the bad\
 guys and still remember to say “Thank you.”\
 Even now, when many of my workdays at Rutgers University are done, Rex Stout,\
 Mark Twain, Arthur Conan Doyle, and Superman are still often at the center of my\
 recreational reading. And when I write a mystery, whatever thread each of my various\
 (line 70) detectives picks up and untangles, something inside reminds me of the chubby kid with\
 the glasses urging the horse to “Jump! Jump!”\
 In terms of distance, it was about 30 feet. In terms of writing, it was a leap of\
 a lifetime.\
Read lines 50 and 51.\
 So two months later, when Sister Mary gave us the essay assignment, it was easy . . . as easy as falling into a pool.\
 These lines mean that the narrator\
(A) has a vivid memory of the previous summer’s events\
 (B) is comparing his achievement with that of the horse\
 (C) is fondly remembering the horse’s splash\
 (D) has a strong feeling of excitement\

 This is the true story of a Kenyan woman named Wangari Maathai.\
 Excerpt from Seeds of Change:\
 Planting a Path to Peace\
 by Jen Cullerton Johnson\
 \
 (paragraph 1) “Come,” Wangari’s mother called. She beckoned her young daughter over to a tall tree with a wide, smooth trunk and a crown of green, oval leaves.\
 \
 (paragraph 2) “Feel,” her mother whispered.\
 \
 (paragraph 3) Wangari spread her small hands over the tree’s trunk. She smoothed her fingers over the rough bark.\
 \
 (paragraph 4) “This is the mugumo,” her mother said. “It is home to many. It feeds many too.”\
 \
 (paragraph 5) She snapped off a wild fig from a low branch, and gave it to her daughter. Wangari ate the delicious fruit, just as geckos and elephants did. High in the tree, birds chirped in their nests. The branches bounced with jumping monkeys.\
 \
 (paragraph 6) “Our people, the Kikuyu of Kenya, believe that our ancestors rest in the tree’s shade,” her mother explained.\
 \
 (paragraph 7) Wangari wrapped her arms around the trunk as if hugging her great-grandmother’s spirit. She promised never to cut down the tree. . . .\
 \
 ((paragraph 8) When Wangari finished elementary school, she was eleven years old. Her mind was like a seed rooted in rich soil, ready to grow. Wangari wanted to continue her education, but to do so she would have to leave her village and move to the capital city of Nairobi. Wangari had never been farther than her valley’s ridge. She was scared.\
 \
 (paragraph 9) “Go,” her mother said. She picked up a handful of earth and placed it gently into her daughter’s hand. “Where you go, we go.” . . .\
 \
 (paragraph 10) As graduation neared, Wangari told her friends she wanted to become a biologist.\
 \
 (paragraph 11) “Not many native women become biologists,” they told her.\
 \
 (paragraph 12) “I will,” she said.\
 \
 (paragraph 13) Wangari watched sadly as her government sold more and more land to big companies that cut down forests for timber and to clear land for coffee plantations. Native trees such as cedar and acacia vanished. Without trees, birds had no place to nest. Monkeys lost their swings. Tired mothers walked miles for firewood. . . .\
 \
 (paragraph 14) When Wangari visited her village she saw that the Kikuyu custom of not chopping down the mugumo trees had been lost. No longer held in place by tree roots, the soil streamed into the rivers. The water that had been used to grow maize, bananas, and sweet potatoes turned to mud and dried up. Many families went hungry.\
 \
 (paragraph 15) Wangari could not bear to think of the land being destroyed. Now married and the mother of three children, she worried about what would happen to the mothers and children who depended on the land.\
 \
 (paragraph 16) “We must do something,” Wangari said.\
 \
 (paragraph 17) Wangari had an idea as small as a seed but as tall as a tree that reaches for the sky. “Harabee! Let’s work together!” she said to her countrywomen—mothers like her. Wangari dug deep into the soil, a seedling by her side. “We must plant trees.” . . .\
 \
 (paragraph 18) Wangari traveled to villages, towns, and cities with saplings and seeds, shovels and hoes. At each place she went, women planted rows of trees that looked like green belts across the land. Because of this they started calling themselves the Green Belt Movement.\
 \
 (paragraph 19) “We might not change the big world but we can change the landscape of the forest,” she said.\
 \
 (paragraph 20) One tree turned to ten, ten to one hundred, one hundred to one million, all the way up to thirty million planted trees. Kenya grew green again. Birds nested in new trees. Monkeys swung on branches. Rivers filled with clean water. Wild figs grew heavy in mugumo branches.\
 \
 (paragraph 21) Mothers fed their children maize, bananas, and sweet potatoes until they could eat no more.\
How does the title of the article support a main idea?\
(A) It describes advice Wangari followed.\
 (B) It describes how Wangari solved a problem.\
 (C) It explains how Wangari felt about trees.\
 (D) It explains which values Wangari’s village held.\

“Janet Guthrie: Lady in the Fast\
 Lane” from Profifiles in Sports Courage\
 by Ken Rappoport\
 \
 (paragraph 1) It was no surprise that Janet Guthrie excelled at one of the most dangerous sports on Earth. She had always loved adventure and daring new experiences.\
 (paragraph 2) Janet was born on March 7, 1938, in Iowa City, Iowa, and lived on a farm for the first few years of her life. Her father, an airline pilot, later moved the family to South Florida, where Janet took up flying.\
 (paragraph 3) At 13, she had already flown an airplane. At age 16, Janet decided she wanted to try a free-fall parachute jump. In free-fall, the parachutist jumps out of a plane without opening the chute. After falling several hundred feet at more than 100 miles an hour, the cord is pulled to open the chute. Then, if all goes well, the parachutist floats safely to the ground.\
 (paragraph 4) Her father wouldn’t hear of it. “Absolutely not,” he said. “No free-fall!”\
 (paragraph 5) But Janet persisted. Finally, her father gave in. “Just one time,” he said, “but you have to be careful and do it the right way.”\
 (paragraph 6) He would allow her to jump only on two conditions: He would fly the plane and she would receive parachuting lessons before the jump.\
 (paragraph 7) Since there were no parachuting schools in South Florida at the time, Janet’s father hired a pro to give her private lessons. In her autobiography, Janet Guthrie—A Life at Full Throttle, Janet said the pro taught her how to pull the rip cord that opened the chute, how to absorb the shock after landing, and how to fasten the helmet so it wouldn’t fly off.\
 ♦ ♦ ♦\
 (paragraph 8) By the time she was 21, she had earned a commercial pilot’s license. She flew whenever she could break away from her classes at the University of Michigan.\
 (paragraph 9) After graduating, Guthrie got a job as a physicist in the aerospace industry. She saved her money for an entire year and bought a car. Guthrie wasn’t satisfied with just any car. She chose a Jaguar XK 120—the sleek and popular sports car that she had dreamed about since she was a teenager.\
 aerospace = a business involved with space flight\
 (paragraph 10) At first, Guthrie enjoyed just driving the car around Long Island, outside New York City. Then she heard about a local sports car club where members could compete. She loved her car and wanted to see how it would do on a track. Soon she was entering races—and winning them.\
 (paragraph 11) Excited by her success, Guthrie attended a driving school in Connecticut. She was a natural. Her instructor, veteran driver Gordon McKenzie, liked the way she handled her car. He suggested she try auto racing.\
 (paragraph 12) A thrill shot through Guthrie. What a great idea. Off she went to enroll in a racing car drivers’ school sponsored by the Sports Car Club of America. Guthrie swapped her Jaguar for a higher-priced model built especially for racing—the XK 140. Before long she taught herself how to take apart and rebuild its engine like a pro.\
 ♦ ♦ ♦\
 (paragraph 13) Guthrie’s career started to pick up speed.\
 (paragraph 14) She entered races all over the United States, finishing in some of the country’s most celebrated long-distance competitions. In 1973, she won the North Atlantic Road Racing Championship. A champion, yes, but a tired champion. By then she had been racing for 13 years. She was exhausted, broke, and thinking of leaving the sport.\
 (paragraph 15) That’s when she got the phone call. Someone named Vollstedt was asking her to drive his car in the 1976 Indy 500. No woman had ever driven in that race. This has to be a prank, thought Guthrie. But Vollstedt, an auto designer and builder from Oregon, wasn’t kidding. Could she drive a “championship” car? That was the big question.\
 (paragraph 16) With their open cockpits, wide wheelbases, and rear engines, championship cars were much different than the closed sports cars Guthrie had been accustomed to driving for many years.\
 (paragraph 17) “Before she would agree to drive for me,” Vollstedt said, “she wanted to see if she could handle the car.”\
 (paragraph 18) Vollstedt was wondering the same thing, too. He arranged for a secret test at the Ontario Motor Speedway near Los Angeles.\
 (paragraph 19) To get into top physical shape for Vollstedt’s test, Guthrie did exercises in front of her TV. One day she lost her balance, landed hard on her left foot, and fell to the floor. The doctors told her she had broken a bone and they put her foot in a heavy cast. How am I going to drive a racing car? she worried. Will I miss my big chance?\
 ♦ ♦ ♦\
 (paragraph 20) Broken ankle and all, Guthrie stepped into an unfamiliar car. She hit the accelerator. When her car got up to speed, Guthrie couldn’t believe the feeling. “What a thrill,” she said. “It was like going to the moon.”\
 (paragraph 21) Vollstedt was impressed with her time—an average speed of 178.52 miles per hour and a top speed of 196 mph.\
 (paragraph 22) Test passed.\
 (paragraph 23) She had showed Vollstedt she could drive the car. Now she had to show the rest of the world.\
Paragraphs 10 and 11 are important to the article because they\
(A) describe to the reader how Guthrie drove around Long Island\
 (B) inform the reader that Guthrie joined a local sports car club\
 (C) explain to the reader how Guthrie began to win auto races\
 (D) tell the reader that Guthrie was helped by a driver in Connecticut\

Reading Comprehension Passage B\
 \
 View with a Grain of Sand\
 \
 We call it a grain of sand\
 but it calls itself neither grain nor sand.\
 It does just fine without a name,\
 whether general, particular,\
 (line 5) permanent, passing,\
 incorrect or apt.\
 \
 Our glance, our touch mean nothing to it.\
 It doesn’t feel itself seen and touched.\
 And that it fell on the windowsill\
 (line 10) is only our experience, not its.\
 For it it’s no different than falling on anything else\
 with no assurance that it’s finished falling\
 or that it’s falling still.\
 \
 The window has a wonderful view of a lake\
 (line 15) but the view doesn’t view itself.\
 It exists in this world\
 colorless, shapeless,\
 soundless, odorless, and painless.\
 \
 The lake’s floor exists floorlessly\
 (line 20) and its shore exists shorelessly.\
 Its water feels itself neither wet nor dry\
 and its waves to themselves are neither singular nor plural.\
 They splash deaf to their own noise\
 on pebbles neither large nor small.\
 \
 (line 25) And all this beneath a sky by nature skyless\
 in which the sun sets without setting at all\
 and hides without hiding behind an unminding cloud.\
 The wind ruffles it, its only reason being\
 that it blows.\
 \
 (line 30) A second passes.\
 A second second.\
 A third.\
 But they’re three seconds only for us.\
 \
 Time has passed like a courier with urgent news.\
 (line 35) But that’s just our simile.\
 The character’s invented, his haste is make-believe,\
 his news inhuman.\

 (2) nature’s superiority\
 (3) human control over the environment\

This is the true story of a Kenyan woman named Wangari Maathai.\
 \
 Excerpt from Seeds of Change:\
 Planting a Path to Peace\
 \
 by Jen Cullerton Johnson\
 \
 (paragraph 1) “Come,” Wangari’s mother called. She beckoned her young daughter over to a tall tree with a wide, smooth trunk and a crown of green, oval leaves.\
 \
 (paragraph 2) “Feel,” her mother whispered.\
 \
 (paragraph 3) Wangari spread her small hands over the tree’s trunk. She smoothed her fingers over the rough bark.\
 \
 (paragraph 4) “This is the mugumo,” her mother said. “It is home to many. It feeds many too.”\
 \
 (paragraph 5) She snapped off a wild fig from a low branch, and gave it to her daughter. Wangari ate the delicious fruit, just as geckos and elephants did. High in the tree, birds chirped in their nests. The branches bounced with jumping monkeys.\
 \
 (paragraph 6) “Our people, the Kikuyu of Kenya, believe that our ancestors rest in the tree’s shade,” her mother explained.\
 \
 (paragraph 7) Wangari wrapped her arms around the trunk as if hugging her great-grandmother’s spirit. She promised never to cut down the tree. . . .\
 \
 ((paragraph 8) When Wangari finished elementary school, she was eleven years old. Her mind was like a seed rooted in rich soil, ready to grow. Wangari wanted to continue her education, but to do so she would have to leave her village and move to the capital city of Nairobi. Wangari had never been farther than her valley’s ridge. She was scared.\
 \
 (paragraph 9) “Go,” her mother said. She picked up a handful of earth and placed it gently into her daughter’s hand. “Where you go, we go.” . . .\
 \
 (paragraph 10) As graduation neared, Wangari told her friends she wanted to become a biologist.\
 \
 (paragraph 11) “Not many native women become biologists,” they told her.\
 \
 (paragraph 12) “I will,” she said.\
 \
 (paragraph 13) Wangari watched sadly as her government sold more and more land to big companies that cut down forests for timber and to clear land for coffee plantations. Native trees such as cedar and acacia vanished. Without trees, birds had no place to nest. Monkeys lost their swings. Tired mothers walked miles for firewood. . . .\
 \
 (paragraph 14) When Wangari visited her village she saw that the Kikuyu custom of not chopping down the mugumo trees had been lost. No longer held in place by tree roots, the soil streamed into the rivers. The water that had been used to grow maize, bananas, and sweet potatoes turned to mud and dried up. Many families went hungry.\
 \
 (paragraph 15) Wangari could not bear to think of the land being destroyed. Now married and the mother of three children, she worried about what would happen to the mothers and children who depended on the land.\
 \
 (paragraph 16) “We must do something,” Wangari said.\
 \
 (paragraph 17) Wangari had an idea as small as a seed but as tall as a tree that reaches for the sky. “Harabee! Let’s work together!” she said to her countrywomen—mothers like her. Wangari dug deep into the soil, a seedling by her side. “We must plant trees.” . . .\
 \
 (paragraph 18) Wangari traveled to villages, towns, and cities with saplings and seeds, shovels and hoes. At each place she went, women planted rows of trees that looked like green belts across the land. Because of this they started calling themselves the Green Belt Movement.\
 \
 (paragraph 19) “We might not change the big world but we can change the landscape of the forest,” she said.\
 \
 (paragraph 20) One tree turned to ten, ten to one hundred, one hundred to one million, all the way up to thirty million planted trees. Kenya grew green again. Birds nested in new trees. Monkeys swung on branches. Rivers filled with clean water. Wild figs grew heavy in mugumo branches.\
 \
 (paragraph 21) Mothers fed their children maize, bananas, and sweet potatoes until they could eat no more.\
Based on the information in the article, where did Wangari most likely get her idea for planting trees across Kenya?\
(A) from the school she attended in the capital city\
 (B) from the government of her country\
 (C) from the women of the village where she grew up\
 (D) from what her mother taught her as a girl\

Reading Comprehension Passage B\
 \
 Amazement Awaits\
 \
 Written on the occasion of the 2008 Olympics at the request of the Olympic Committee\
 \
 Sheer amazement awaits\
 Amazement luxuriant in promise\
 Abundant in wonder\
 Our beautiful children arrive at this Universal stadium.\
 \
 (line 5) They have bathed in the waters of the world\
 And carry the soft silt of the Amazon, the Nile,\
 The Danube, the Rhine, the Yangtze and the Mississippi\
 In the palms of their right hands.\
 A wild tiger nestles in each armpit\
 (line 10) And a meadowlark perches on each shoulder.\
 \
 We, the world audience, stand, arms akimbo, (akimbo — with hands on hips and elbows turned outward)\
 Longing for the passion of the animal:\
 The melody of the lark\
 And the tigers’ passion\
 (line 15) Attend the opening bells,\
 The birds sing of the amazement which awaits\
 \
 The miracle of joy that comes out of the gathering of our best,\
 bringing their best,\
 Displaying the splendor of their bodies and the radiance of their\
 (line 20) agile minds to the cosmos.\
 \
 Encouragement to those other youth caught in the maws (maws — jaws) of poverty,\
 Crippled by the terror of ignorance.\
 \
 They say,\
 Brothers and Sisters,\
 (line 25) Yes, try.\
 Then try harder.\
 Lunge forward, press eagerly for release.\
 The amazement which awaits is for you.\
 \
 We are here at the portal of the world we had wished for\
 (line 30) At the lintel (lintel — a horizontal support above a door or window) of the world we most need.\
 We are here roaring and singing.\
 We prove that we can not only make peace, we can bring it with us.\
 \
 With respect for the world and its people,\
 We can compete passionately without hatred.\
 (line 35) With respect for the world and its people,\
 We can take pride in the achievement of strangers.\
 With respect for the world and its people,\
 We can share openly in the success of friends.\
 \
 Here then is the Amazement:\
 (line 40) Against the odds of impending war,\
 In the mouth of bloody greed,\
 Human grace and human spirit can still conquer.\
 \
 Ah…\
 We discover, we ourselves\
 (line 45) Are the Amazement which awaits\
 We are ourselves Amazement.\

 . . . Climate change is not equally felt across the globe, and neither are its longer term consequences. . . . Climate change is a threat multiplier: It contributes to economic and political instability and also worsens the effects. It propels sudden onset disasters like floods and storms and slow-onset disasters like drought and desertification; those disasters contribute to failed crops, famine and overcrowded urban centers; those crises inflame political unrest and worsen the impacts of war, which leads to even more displacement. There is no internationally recognized legal definition for “environmental migrants” or “climate refugees,” so there is no formal reckoning of how many have left their homes because climate change has made their lives or livelihoods untenable [unsustainable]. In a 2010 Gallup World Poll, though, about 12 percent of respondents — representing a total of 500 million adults — said severe environmental problems would require them to move within the next five years. . . .\

 \
 French Colonization of Vietnam\
 \
 . . Economic development always involved what benefited France and her French colonists, not the Vietnamese. Vietnam was kept as dependent on the mother country as possible, both as a source of raw materials and as a captive market for French manufactured goods. Customs regulations were designed to promote French products and discourage competition from foreign goods, thus restricting the consumer in what he could buy.\
    A less shortsighted administration could have predicted the eventual outcome of these restrictive policies, but it took raw armed force to shock the French and the rest of the world into the realities of the situation. In a few words, the people were getting fed up. . .\

Excerpt from Wheels of Change: How Women Rode the Bicycle to Freedom (With a Few Flat Tires Along the Way)\
 \
 by Sue Macy\
 \
 (paragraph 1) Women’s rights crusader Elizabeth Cady Stanton was in her eighties during the heyday of the bicycle, and no evidence exists to show that she actually ever rode one. But there was no better or more eloquent advocate for women and the wheel. In 1895, Stanton contributed an article to the American Wheelman celebrating this “wonderful new style of locomotion.” In the article, titled “The Era of the Bicycle,” she pointed out that cycling was increasing people’s mobility, eliminating the cost of feeding and housing horses, and encouraging the building of good roads. However, she saved her greatest praise for the bicycle’s effects on women. “The bicycle,” she wrote, “will inspire women with more courage, self-respect and self-reliance and make the next generation more vigorous of mind and of body; for feeble mothers do not produce great statesmen, scientists and scholars.”\
 \
 (paragraph 2) For all the practical benefits of the two-wheeler, the fact is that it brought about a cosmic shift in women’s private and public lives. With the rise of industry and the move from a rural to an urban economy in the 19th century, American women had become increasingly confined to their homes. Young girls could play outside, but when they matured, their freedom of movement was greatly restricted. “At sixteen years of age, I was enwrapped in the long skirts that impeded every footstep,” remembered Frances Willard, who in 1895 wrote a best-selling account of how she learned to ride abicycle at age 53. “I have detested walking and felt with a certain noble disdain that the conventions of life had cut me off from what . . . had been one of life’s sweetest joys.”\
 \
 (paragraph 3) While wealthier women were saddled with long skirts and restrictive corsets, those who were less well off worked anonymously in mills and factories. All in all, the result was the same. Except in a few instances, the public image of America was male. Politicians, soldiers, business leaders, and even the leading athletes in the new sports of baseball and football were all men. But the bicycle changed that. Suddenly, women were leaving their homes to cycle and socialize on country roads and city streets. Bicycle racers such as Louise Armaindo and Frankie Nelson had their exploits splashed all over the papers. Bicycle manufacturers, intent on mining an untapped market, showed female models in their advertisements. Thanks to the wheel, women were starting to be seen and heard in public life.\
 \
 (paragraph 4) It was not a stretch for some cyclists to see the possibility of a larger role for women in the world. When she conquered the wheel, Frances Willard was a former university president and the longtime president of the Woman’s Christian Temperance Union, which fought to prohibit the use of alcoholic beverages and to win women the right to vote. Willard saw parallels between learning to ride and learning to live. “I began to feel that myself plus the bicycle equaled myself plus the world, upon whose spinning wheel we must all learn to ride,” she wrote. “He who succeeds, or, to be more exact in handing over my experience, she who succeeds in gaining the mastery of [a bicycle], will gain the mastery of life.”\
 \
 (paragraph 5) For decades, Willard, along with Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Susan B. Anthony, and many others, had been working toward increased political and economic rights for women. Now the bicycle brought a taste of independence to women on a very personal level, and some of them took the opportunity to express their discontent with old traditions and expectations. In August 1895, a cyclist named Ann Strong caused a stir when she compared the value of a bicycle to that of a husband in the Minneapolis Tribune. “I can’t see but that a wheel is just as good company as most husbands,” she declared. “I would as lief (lief - happily) talk to one inanimate object as another; and I’d a great deal rather talk to one that can’t answer than one that won’t.” Strong then contrasted the joy of cycling with the challenges of raising a family. “You can make your wheel tidy over night,” she said, “and it never kicks off its shoes the very last minute, and never smears itself with molasses. When you are ready you can start. No little elbows are stuck in your ribs; there is no wiggling; screams at the cars or at the candy stores. You glide along, silently, smoothly, swiftly.”\
 \
 (paragraph 6) Some stated the liberating effects of the bicycle with less sarcasm. “The bicycle has brought to women a healthful, wholesome means of securing a degree of freedom and independence that no amount of discussion regarding ‘women’s rights’ would ever have produced,” wrote the L.A.W. Bulletin and Good Roads magazine in 1898. Meanwhile, Munsey’s Magazine assessed the impact of the wheel on women in a special bicycle-themed issue. “If she has ridden her bicycle into new fields, becoming in the process a new creature, it has been gradually and unconsciously,” the editors wrote.\
 \
 (paragraph 7) “She did not have to be born again in some mysterious fashion, becoming a strange creature, a ‘new woman.’ She is more like the ‘eternal feminine,’ who has taken on wings, and who is using them with an ever increasing delight in her new power.” Indeed, many bicycle companies at home and abroad did put wings on the women in their advertisements, emphasizing that they had taken flight.\
 \
 (paragraph 8) Not all publications treated the emergence of the “new woman” with the same level of approval. Some mocked her, while others just seemed baffled by her. Her new way of dressing, in bloomers or divided skirts or skirts with shortened hems, certainly disturbed the old social order, but so did her confidence and daring. These traits led commentators to worry that the differences between the sexes were being blurred, a fear that was reinforced as the four newest states—Wyoming, Colorado, Utah, and Idaho—granted women the right to vote in the 1890s. Would the bicycle help bring about a new kind of equality between men and women? Elizabeth Cady Stanton and her colleagues certainly hoped so. At any rate, the image of a female cyclist quickly became associated with efforts to win more rights for women.\
What idea about women riding bicycles is emphasized in paragraphs 6 and 7?\
(A) Riding bicycles offered more than just freedom of movement.\
 (B) Riding bicycles was a simple way to participate in a political movement.\
 (C) Riding bicycles changed women’s fashion.\
 (D) Riding bicycles was a popular subject in magazines.\

Reading Comprehension Passage A\
 \
 …It was so cold that his first breath turned to iron in his throat, the hairs in his nostrils\
 webbed into instant ice, his eyes stung and watered. In the faint starlight and the bluish\
 luminescence of the snow everything beyond a few yards away swam deceptive and without\
 depth, glimmering with things half seen or imagined. Beside the dead car he stood with his\
 (line 5) head bent, listening, and there was not a sound. Everything on the planet might have died\
 in the cold. …\
 \
 But here he stood in light overcoat and thin leather gloves, without overshoes, and his\
 car all but blocked the road, and the door could not be locked, and there was not a\
 possibility that he could carry the heavy cases with him to the next farm or village. He\
 (line 10) switched on the headlights again and studied the roadside they revealed, and saw a rail\
 fence, with cedars and spruces behind it. When more complex gadgets and more complex\
 cures failed, there was always the lucifer match (lucifer match — a match that ignites through friction).\
 \
 Ten minutes later he was sitting with the auto robe over his head and shoulders and his\
 back against the plowed snowbank, digging the half melted snow from inside his shoes and\
 (line 15) gloating over the growing light and warmth of the fire. He had a supply of fence rails good\
 for an hour. In that time, someone would come along and he could get a push or a tow. In\
 this country, in winter, no one ever passed up a stranded motorist. …\
 \
 Abruptly he did not want to wait in that lonely snow-banked ditch any longer. The\
 sample cases (sample cases — cases of medicine samples) could look after themselves, any motorist who passed could take his own\
 (line 20) chances. He would walk ahead to the nearest help, and if he found himself getting too cold\
 on the way, he could always build another fire. The thought of action cheered him; he\
 admitted to himself that he was all but terrified at the silence and the iron cold. …\
 \
 Turning with the road, he passed through the stretch of woods and came into the open\
 to see the moon-white, shadow-black buildings of a farm, and the weak bloom of light in a\
 (line 25) window. …\
 \
 “Hello?” he said, and knocked again. “Anybody home?” No sound answered him. He\
 saw the moon glint on the great icicles along the eaves. His numb hand ached with the pain\
 of knocking; he pounded with the soft edge of his fist.\
 \
 Answer finally came, not from the door before which he stood, but from the barn, down\
 (line 30) at the end of a staggered string of attached sheds. A door creaked open against a snowbank\
 and a figure with a lantern appeared, stood for a moment, and came running. The traveler\
 wondered at the way it came, lurching and stumbling in the uneven snow, until it arrived at\
 the porch and he saw that it was a boy of eleven or twelve. The boy set his lantern on the\
 porch; between the upturned collar of his mackinaw (mackinaw — type of warm coat) and the down-pulled stocking cap his\
 (line 35) face was a pinched whiteness, his eyes enormous. He stared at the traveler until the traveler\
 became aware of the blanket he still held over head and shoulders, and began to laugh.\
 \
 “My car stopped on me, a mile or so up the road,” he said. “I was just hunting a\
 telephone or some place where I could get help.”\
 \
 The boy swallowed, wiped the back of his mitt across his nose. “Grandpa’s sick!” he\
 (line 40) blurted, and opened the door. …\
 \
 “He must’ve had a shock,” the boy said. “I came in from chores and he was on the floor.”\
 He stared at the mummy under the quilt, and he swallowed. …\
 \
 “Why didn’t you go for help?”\
 \
 The boy looked down, ashamed. “It’s near two miles. I was afraid he’d.…”\
 \
 (line 45) “But you left him. You were out in the barn.”\
 \
 “I was hitching up to go,” the boy said. “I’d made up my mind.”\
 \
 The traveler backed away from the stove, his face smarting (smarting — stinging) with the heat, his fingers\
 and feet beginning to ache. He looked at the old man and knew that here, as at the car, he\
 was helpless. The boy’s thin anxious face told him how thoroughly his own emergency had\
 (line 50) been swallowed up in this other one. He had been altered from a man in need of help to\
 one who must give it. Salesman of wonder cures, he must now produce something to calm\
 this over-worried boy, restore a dying man. Rebelliously, victimized by circumstances, he\
 said, “Where were you going for help?”\
 \
 “The Hill place. They’ve got a phone.”\
 \
 (line 55) “How far are they from a town?”\
 \
 “About five miles.”\
 \
 “Doctor there?”\
 \
 “Yes.”\
 \
 “If I took your horse and—what is it, sleigh?—could someone at the Hills’ bring them\
 (line 60) back, do you think?”\
 \
 “Cutter (cutter — a small horse-drawn sled). One of the Hill boys could, I should say.”\
 \
 “Or would you rather go, while I look after your Grandpa?”\
 \
 “He don’t know you,” the boy said directly. “If he should wake up he might … wonder\
 … it might.…”\
 \
 (line 65) The traveler grudgingly gave up the prospect of staying in the warm kitchen while the\
 boy did the work. And he granted that it was extraordinarily sensitive of the boy to know\
 how it might disturb a man to wake from sickness in his own house and stare into the face\
 of an utter stranger. “Yes,” he said. “Well, I could call the doctor from the Hills’. Two miles,\
 did you say?” …\
 \
 (line 70) He climbed into the cutter and pulled over his lap the balding buffalo robe he found\
 there; the scallop (scallop — curve) of its felt edges was like a key that fitted a door. The horses breathed jets\
 of steam in the moonlight, restlessly moving, jingling their harness bells, as the moment\
 lengthened itself. The traveler saw how the boy, now that his anxiety was somewhat quieted,\
 now that he had been able to unload part of his burden, watched him with a thousand\
 (line 75) questions in his face, and he remembered how he himself, thirty years ago, had searched\
 the faces of passing strangers for something he could not name, how he had listened to their\
 steps and seen their shadows lengthen ahead of them down roads that led to unimaginable\
 places, and how he had ached with the desire to know them, who they were. But none of\
 them had looked back at him as he tried now to look at this boy. …\
 \
 (line 80) For half a breath he was utterly bewitched, frozen at the heart of some icy dream.\
 Abruptly he slapped the reins across the backs of the horses; the cutter jerked and then slid\
 smoothly out toward the road. The traveler looked back once, to fix forever the picture of\
 himself standing silently watching himself go. As he slid into the road the horses broke into\
 a trot. The icy flow of air locked his throat and made him let go the reins with one hand to\
 (line 85) pull the hairy, wool-smelling edge of the blanket all but shut across his face.\
 \
 Along a road he had never driven he went swiftly toward an unknown farm and an\
 unknown town, to distribute according to some wise law part of the burden of the boy’s\
 emergency and his own; but he bore (bore — carried) in his mind, bright as moonlight over snow, a vivid\
 wonder, almost an awe. For from that most chronic and incurable of ills, identity, he had\
 (line 90) looked outward and for one unmistakable instant recognized himself.\

 —Wallace Stegner\
 excerpted from “The Traveler”\
 Harper’s Magazine, February 1951\
The details in lines 7 through 12 demonstrate that the traveler\

Tom is spending the summer on his aunt and uncle's farm. He misses his friend Petie, so he writes letters to Petie describing events on the farm.\
 \
 Excerpt from The Midnight Fox\
 by Betsy Byars\
 (paragraph 1) I had just finished writing this letter and was waiting for a minute to see if I would think of anything to add when I looked up and saw the black fox.\
 (paragraph 2) I did not believe it for a minute. It was like my eyes were playing a trick or something, because I was just sort of staring across this field, thinking about my letter, and then in the distance, where the grass was very green, I saw a fox leaping over the crest of the field. The grass moved and the fox sprang toward the movement, and then, seeing that it was just the wind that had caused the grass to move, she ran straight for the grove of trees where I was sitting\
 (paragraph 3) It was so great that I wanted it to start over again, like you can turn movie film back and see yourself repeat some fine thing you have done, and I wanted to see the fox leaping over the grass again. In all my life I have never been so excited.\
 (paragraph 4) I did not move at all, but I could hear the paper in my hand shaking, and my heart seemed to have moved up in my body and got stuck in my throat.\
 (paragraph 5) The fox came straight toward the grove of trees. She wasn't afraid, and I knew she had not seen me against the tree. I stayed absolutely still even though I felt like jumping up and screaming, \"Aunt Millie! Uncle Fred! Come see this. It's a fox, a fox!\"\
 (paragraph 6) Her steps as she crossed the field were lighter and quicker than a cat's. As she came closer I could see that her black fur was tipped with white. It was as if it were midnight and the moon were shining on her fur, frosting it. The wind parted her fur as it changed directions. Suddenly she stopped. She was ten feet away now, and with the changing of the wind she had got my scent. She looked right at me.\
 (paragraph 7) I did not move for a moment and neither did she. Her head was cocked to one side, her tail curled up, her front left foot raised. In all my life I never saw anything like that fox standing there with her pale golden eyes on me and this great black fur being blown by the wind.\
 (paragraph 8) Suddenly her nose quivered. It was such a slight movement I almost didn't see it, and then her mouth opened and I could see the pink tip of her tongue. She turned. She still was not afraid, but with a bound that was lighter than the wind-it was as if she was being blown away over the field-she was gone.\
 (paragraph 9) Still I didn't move. I couldn't. I couldn't believe that I had really seen the fox.\
 (paragraph 10) I had seen foxes before in zoos, but I was always in such a great hurry to get on to the good stuff that I was saying stupid things like, \"I want to see the go-rilllllas\", and not once had I ever really looked at a fox. Still, I could never remember seeing a black fox, not even in a zoo.\
 (paragraph 11) Also, there was a great deal of difference between seeing an animal in the zoo in front of painted fake rocks and trees and seeing one natural and free in the woods. It was like seeing a kite on the floor and then, later, seeing one up in the sky where it was supposed to be, pulling at the wind.\
 (paragraph 12) I started to pick up my pencil and write as quickly as I could, \"P.S. Today I saw a black fox.\" But I didn't. This was the most exciting thing that had happened to me, and \"P.S. Today I saw a black fox\" made it nothing. \"So what else is happening?\" Petie Burkis would probably write back. I folded my letter, put it in an envelope, and sat there.\
 (paragraph 13) I thought about this old newspaper that my dad had had in his desk drawer for years. It was orange and the headline was just one word, very big, the letters about twelve inches high. WAR! And I mean it was awesome to see that word like that, because you knew it was a word that was going to change your whole life, the whole world even. And every time I would see that newspaper, even though I wasn't even born when it was printed, I couldn't say anything for a minute or two.\
 (paragraph 14) Well, this was the way I felt right then about the black fox. I thought about a newspaper with just one word for a headline, very big, very black letters, twelve inches high. FOX! And even that did not show how awesome it had really been to me.\
How is Tom's experience in the field different from his experience in zoos?\
(A) He is able to observe a black fox in the wild.\
 (B) He is able to observe the way a black fox moves at the zoo.\
 (C) He spends time observing a black fox at the zoo.\
 (D) He is frightened to see a black fox in the wild.\

 This is the true story of a Kenyan woman named Wangari Maathai.\
 Excerpt from Seeds of Change:\
 Planting a Path to Peace\
 by Jen Cullerton Johnson\
 \
 (paragraph 1) “Come,” Wangari’s mother called. She beckoned her young daughter over to a tall tree with a wide, smooth trunk and a crown of green, oval leaves.\
 \
 (paragraph 2) “Feel,” her mother whispered.\
 \
 (paragraph 3) Wangari spread her small hands over the tree’s trunk. She smoothed her fingers over the rough bark.\
 \
 (paragraph 4) “This is the mugumo,” her mother said. “It is home to many. It feeds many too.”\
 \
 (paragraph 5) She snapped off a wild fig from a low branch, and gave it to her daughter. Wangari ate the delicious fruit, just as geckos and elephants did. High in the tree, birds chirped in their nests. The branches bounced with jumping monkeys.\
 \
 (paragraph 6) “Our people, the Kikuyu of Kenya, believe that our ancestors rest in the tree’s shade,” her mother explained.\
 \
 (paragraph 7) Wangari wrapped her arms around the trunk as if hugging her great-grandmother’s spirit. She promised never to cut down the tree. . . .\
 \
 ((paragraph 8) When Wangari finished elementary school, she was eleven years old. Her mind was like a seed rooted in rich soil, ready to grow. Wangari wanted to continue her education, but to do so she would have to leave her village and move to the capital city of Nairobi. Wangari had never been farther than her valley’s ridge. She was scared.\
 \
 (paragraph 9) “Go,” her mother said. She picked up a handful of earth and placed it gently into her daughter’s hand. “Where you go, we go.” . . .\
 \
 (paragraph 10) As graduation neared, Wangari told her friends she wanted to become a biologist.\
 \
 (paragraph 11) “Not many native women become biologists,” they told her.\
 \
 (paragraph 12) “I will,” she said.\
 \
 (paragraph 13) Wangari watched sadly as her government sold more and more land to big companies that cut down forests for timber and to clear land for coffee plantations. Native trees such as cedar and acacia vanished. Without trees, birds had no place to nest. Monkeys lost their swings. Tired mothers walked miles for firewood. . . .\
 \
 (paragraph 14) When Wangari visited her village she saw that the Kikuyu custom of not chopping down the mugumo trees had been lost. No longer held in place by tree roots, the soil streamed into the rivers. The water that had been used to grow maize, bananas, and sweet potatoes turned to mud and dried up. Many families went hungry.\
 \
 (paragraph 15) Wangari could not bear to think of the land being destroyed. Now married and the mother of three children, she worried about what would happen to the mothers and children who depended on the land.\
 \
 (paragraph 16) “We must do something,” Wangari said.\
 \
 (paragraph 17) Wangari had an idea as small as a seed but as tall as a tree that reaches for the sky. “Harabee! Let’s work together!” she said to her countrywomen—mothers like her. Wangari dug deep into the soil, a seedling by her side. “We must plant trees.” . . .\
 \
 (paragraph 18) Wangari traveled to villages, towns, and cities with saplings and seeds, shovels and hoes. At each place she went, women planted rows of trees that looked like green belts across the land. Because of this they started calling themselves the Green Belt Movement.\
 \
 (paragraph 19) “We might not change the big world but we can change the landscape of the forest,” she said.\
 \
 (paragraph 20) One tree turned to ten, ten to one hundred, one hundred to one million, all the way up to thirty million planted trees. Kenya grew green again. Birds nested in new trees. Monkeys swung on branches. Rivers filled with clean water. Wild figs grew heavy in mugumo branches.\
 \
 (paragraph 21) Mothers fed their children maize, bananas, and sweet potatoes until they could eat no more.\
Based on the information in the article, where did Wangari most likely get her idea for planting trees across Kenya?\
(A) from the school she attended in the capital city\
 (B) from the government of her country\
 (C) from the women of the village where she grew up\
 (D) from what her mother taught her as a girl\

Base your answers to questions 3 and 4 on the passage below and on your knowledge of social studies.\
 \
 . . .The poor harvest could not have come at a worse moment. France had entered into an unfavorable trade treaty with England in 1776. The pact reduced import duties on English goods, the notion being to encourage French manufacturers to mechanize production in response to enhanced competition. A flood of cheap imports from across the Channel overwhelmed the cloth industry. Cloth production alone fell by 50 percent between 1787 and 1789. The 5,672 looms in Amiens and Abbeville in 1785 were down to 2,204 by 1789. Thirty-six thousand people were put out of work, throwing many poor workers onto city streets at a time when hungry peasants were flocking to urban centers in search of food. The rural crisis might have been short-lived had not urban unemployment mushroomed at the same time. In Paris, the government subsidized bread prices out of fear of the mobs, but to no avail. The situation was soon out of control. . . .\

Clash of the Condiments: Wasabi vs. the Chili Pepper\
 by Mary Beth Cox\
 \
 Most condiments are peaceable enough. The sauces, spreads, and pickles of the world\
 add flavor to our foods without kicking up much of a fuss. This is not true of the pungent\
 or “hot’’ condiments. They are more aggressive. They get our attention by purposely\
 causing us pain. These strong-armed seasonings are often the source of friendly\
 (line 5) competitions. Loyal fans will contend that their favorite pungent condiment is the one that\
 packs the most powerful punch. Ladies and gentlemen, you are cordially welcomed to just\
 such a contest. Here it is, the Match of the Moment: Wasabi vs. the Chili Pepper.\
 IN YOUR CORNERS\
 Introducing in the Green Corner, hailing from the island nation of Japan, sushi’s\
 inseparable sidekick: Wasabi! Wasabia japonica grows wild on the cool, damp banks of\
 (line 10) Japan’s many mountain streams. The chill of its habitat is quite ironic since wasabi is\
 famous for bringing the heat. The plant is a botanical relative of mustard and horseradish.\
 Pungency runs in the family. Traditionally, wasabi is prepared by grating its rootstock on\
 the abrasive skin of an angel shark. Authentic wasabi is relatively rare and difficult to\
 come by. The emerald condiment that is served outside of Japan is almost always\
 (line 15) horseradish pulp dyed with green food coloring. Whether the wasabi is real or whether it’s\
 the more common substitute, a whopping snootful will make you cry for your momma!\
 And in the red corner, originating from the Central and South Americas, now an\
 international culinary superstar: the Chili Pepper. Chili peppers are fruits of the plants of\
 the botanical genus Capsicum. They are related to the tomato and the eggplant. They’re\
 (line 20) the renegades in an otherwise mild-mannered botanical family. Chili peppers include but\
 are not limited to the poblano, the cayenne, the jalapeño, the tabasco, the habanero, and\
 the serrano. One of these culprits sometimes goes by the alias “chipotle.’’ A chipotle\
 (pronounced chee-POHT-lay) is none other than a dried smoked jalape ño. Chilies were\
 introduced to the non-American world by Christopher Columbus, who mistakenly\
 (line 25) identified them as variants of black pepper. Chilies have since taken the culinary world by\
 storm. They appear alongside dishes served around the globe, from the Basque provinces\
 to North Africa and the Middle East, to India and Southeast Asia. A potent chili pepper in\
 the kisser will make you rue the day you were born!\
 POWERFUL PUNCHES\
 Both wasabi and chilies are condiments of world-class pungency. But how do they\
 (line 30) match up head to head? Each has its own unique tactical move. Each has its own special\
 point of attack. The active ingredient of the wasabi plant is stored stealthily in its cells.\
 Under normal growing conditions, this ingredient is completely harmless. It’s not until the\
 plant’s cells are ruptured (as by the grating action of angel shark skin) that the trouble\
 begins. Enzymes convert the ingredient into molecules of allyl isothiocyanate. It’s the\
 (line 35) chemical characteristics of these irritating molecules that are the secret to wasabi’s\
 pungency. Allyl isothiocyanate molecules are lightweight. They are volatile. They are also\
 soluble in water. As a consequence, the consumption of wasabi launches an airborne\
 assault on the consumer’s sinuses. Allyl isothiocyanate molecules waft up the nose and\
 back of the throat. They dissolve in the watery fluids they find there. They intercept nerve\
 (line 40) endings in the nasal passages. Specifically, these molecules target pain receptors of the\
 type known as TRPA I . TRPA I receptors respond to the attack by sending emergency\
 signals to the brain: “Yikes . . . we’ve gotten hold of something painfully hot!’’\
 Chili peppers conduct operations of a different sort. Their active ingredient is a\
 substance called capsaicin. It’s found in the spongy inner tissue of peppers, but it can leak\
 (line 45) onto the seeds and inner wall of the fruit. Capsaicin molecules are heavier than the\
 molecules of wasabi’s allyl isothiocyanate. They are not volatile. They prefer to dissolve in\
 oils, so they aren’t as easily dissolved in water. Capsaicin molecules instigate an incendiary\
 assault upon contact with exposed vulnerable surfaces. They cling to the tender tissues of\
 the lips, mouth, and throat. They burn eyes that are rubbed with capsaicin-laced fingers.\
 (line 50) Capsaicin molecules interact with pain receptors of the type TRPV I. Again an alert is\
 expedited to the brain: “Mayday! Mayday! Let’s not eat any more of that, please!’’\
 WHERE’S THE REFEREE?\
 So which of these condiments causes the most pain? To settle any contest, a scoring\
 system is required. There is a way to compare the relative heat intensities of the various\
 chili peppers. It’s called the Scoville scale. Scoville ratings are determined by brave human\
 (line 55) test subjects who willingly sip extracts of chili pepper juice. Extracted juices are diluted\
 again and again until their heat can no longer be detected. A high rating on the Scoville\
 scale means that a lot of dilutions are necessary to eliminate the pain caused by a\
 particular pepper. Unfortunately, Scoville ratings are not applicable to wasabi. The method\
 is specifically designed to extract capsaicin from chili peppers. It doesn’t work for allyl\
 (line 60) isothiocyanate, or for anything else.\
 Pepper pungencies are also compared by using chromatography. Chromatography is an\
 analytical technique that separates the chemical components of a mixture. After\
 separation, the amounts of each component are quantified. Chromatography can\
 determine how much capsaicin is in a pepper. It can also determine how much allyl\
 (line 65) isothiocyanate is in wasabi. If two chili peppers have the same amount of capsaicin, it can\
 be assumed that those peppers are equally “hot.’’ But the same assumption cannot be made\
 when comparing chili peppers to wasabi. There’s no way to know if equal amounts of\
 capsaicin and allyl isothiocyanate cause equal degrees of pain. So chromatography cannot\
 definitively judge this contest.\
 (line 70) It isn’t even possible to directly measure and compare nerve responses, since\
 two different types of pain receptors are involved. Wasabi and chili peppers are like\
 pungent apples and oranges. There’s no objective way to declare one more potent than the\
 other. This friendly competition won’t be settled anytime soon. Everyone is free to chime\
 in with an opinion. You just have to try both of these pungent powerhouses, then root for\
 (line 75) your own favorite flavor of pain.\
Read this sentence from lines 37 and 38 of the article.\
 As a consequence, the consumption of wasabi launches an airborne assault on the consumer’s sinuses.\
 What does the phrase “airborne assault” add to the author’s description?\
(A) It explains the effect of experiencing the molecules in wasabi.\
 (B) It suggests a painful experience that makes wasabi undesirable.\
 (C) It warns that direct contact with wasabi causes injury.\
 (D) It cautions that wasabi causes an intense repeated attack occurring over time.\

Reading Comprehension Passage C\
 \
 …Nowhere is light pollution more apparent, almost achingly so, than in satellite images\
 of the Earth from space. The continental United States seems to split in half: the eastern\
 side is brighter than the west, except for the klieg lights of Las Vegas. Highways innervate (innervate - energize)\
 America, connecting luminous dots of small towns and big cities. Across the Atlantic,\
 (line 5) Europe shimmers. Moscow is a radiant nine-pointed star. The Nile Delta glows like a\
 dandelion sprouting from mostly indigo Africa. Farther east, Hong Kong and Shanghai are\
 ablaze, and the demilitarised zone separates dark North Korea from South Korea more\
 cleanly than if the peninsula had been cleft in two. Developed society, it’s clear, is where the\
 light is.\
 \
 (line 10) Human-controlled light has pierced the night for thousands of years, long before\
 [Thomas] Edison. Campfires warmed our ancestors’ feet and cooked their meals; the\
 Harvard anthropologist Richard Wrangham argues in his book Catching Fire (2009) that\
 gathering around a flame to eat and to commune with others is, in fact, what made us\
 human. Not just fellowship but safety has long been the primary rationale for pushing back\
 (line 15) the night. ‘Evil spirits love not the smell of lamps,’ as Plato put it. Comforting, lambent (lambent — glowing or flickering with a soft radiance) \
 lamplight led us safely home by tattling on the people and potholes and animals that would\
 otherwise do us harm. By the early 17th century, residents of cities such as Paris and London\
 were admonished (admonished — warned) to keep lights burning in the windows of all houses that faced the streets,\
 as the historian A. Roger Ekirch notes in his book At Day’s Close: Night in Times Past\
 (line 20) (2005). Taxpayers funded oil lamps and candlelit lanterns for the avenues, while only\
 genteel households could afford fine beeswax or spermaceti candles; most people relied on\
 tallow, made from animal fat. …\
 \
 And even so — what price safety! A young but rapidly growing field of research suggests\
 that night-time light itself is far more dangerous than the dark. In a 2012 report, an\
 (line 25) American Medical Association committee called electric lighting a ‘man-made self-\
 experiment’ creating potentially harmful health effects. Humans, and everything else that\
 lives on this planet with us, evolved during billions of years along a reliable cycle of day and\
 night, with clear boundaries between them. Staunching the flood of artificial light can help\
 restore this divide. Our well-being, and that of our fellow creatures, might depend on us\
 (line 30) doing so — or at the very least trying. The loss of night-time darkness neglects our shared\
 past, but it might very well cut short our futures too. …\

 A growing body of evidence shows that light pollution exacerbates (exacerbates — makes a situation worse),  and might directly\
 cause, cancer, obesity, and depression, the troublesome triumvirate (triumvirate — a group of three holding power) of industrialised\
 society. One of the first people to notice this correlation, at least as it applies to cancer, is\
 (line 35) Richard Stevens, a professor at the University of Connecticut, respected cancer\
 epidemiologist (epidemiologist — health professional who investigates patterns and causes of diseases), and mild insomniac. In the early 1980s, Stevens and other researchers\
 were beginning to realise there was little or no connection between diet and rising rates \
 breast cancer, contrary to what had been suspected. As Stevens puts it, it was like a light\
 bulb going on when he realised that, in fact, a light bulb going on might be a culprit. …\
 \
 (line 40) ‘Rather than falling, night, to the watchful eye, rises,’ writes Ekirch in At Day’s Close.\
 Shadows creep up lows and valleys first, then consume hillsides and houses and the tallest\
 buildings. Muted greys and deeper blues chase off the sun until finally the sky leaks no\
 colour. When we sleep according to a solar cycle, melatonin (melantonin - hormone that regulates sleep and wakefulness) production follows this\
 pattern, rising with the night. But artificial light tamps it down. This is frustratingly\
 (line 45) apparent for a special class of humans who experience sunsets every 90 minutes: astronauts.\
 \
 One of the most frequent complaints of orbital crew members is insomnia; they pop\
 sleeping pills on a regular basis, and still get only about six hours of shuteye, though they’re\
 allotted eight. Steven W. Lockley, a Harvard neuroscientist, recommends altering the light\
 to improve matters. In 2012, he advised NASA [National Aeronautics and Space\
 (line 50) Administration] engineers to change the light bulbs on the International Space Station to a\
 type of LED that can display blue-shifted light during the ‘day’, when the crew is working,\
 and red-shifted light when they need to rest. Why the difference? That crucial ganglion (ganglion — mass of nerve tissues in the brain),\
 the circadian (circadian — 24-hour biological cycle) photoreceptor, is particularly sensitive to light toward the bluish end of the\
 red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo and violet visible-light spectrum. …\
 \
 (line 55) Insomnia is hardly the worst side effect of light pollution. Shift workers, who rise with\
 the night and work awash in blue light, experience not only disrupted circadian rhythms and\
 sleep deprivation, but an increased risk of breast and prostate cancer. These cancers, which\
 require hormones to grow, are suppressed in the presence of melatonin, Stevens has shown.\
 In 2010, Stevens published a review of breast cancer sensitivity in 164 countries, and found\
 (line 60) a 30 to 50 per cent increased risk of cancer in nations with the worst light pollution, but no\
 increased prevalence of non-hormonally dependent cancers in the same populations.\
 \
 ‘Our use of electric light in the modern world is disrupting our circadian sleep and our\
 biology. There is no question about that. Does that have physiological consequences? There\
 is more and more evidence that it does,’ Stevens told me. ‘The epidemiological studies are\
 (line 65) the crudest, but the most important.’ …\
 \
 When we, in the industrialised world, do manage to turn off the lights, there are\
 measurable, beneficial effects on our circadian rhythms. In a widely reported paper last\
 summer, Kenneth Wright at the University of Colorado at Boulder took eight students\
 camping in the Rocky Mountains for two weeks. They weren’t allowed to use any artificial\
 (line 70) light after the sun went down — only the sanguine (sanguine — red) glow of campfire. After a week,\
 melatonin started to rise at sunset, peak in the middle of the night, and taper just at sunrise,\
 which Wright called a ‘remarkable’ result. ‘Internal biological time under natural light-dark\
 conditions tightly synchronises to environmental time, and in this regard, humans are\
 comparable to other animals,’ he wrote. …\
 \
 (line 75) For those of us addicted to our glowing phones and tablets, an app called F.lux can help.\
 It ‘warms’ your device’s display screen so that it shifts red in the evening, more closely\
 matching incandescent bulbs and the hue of the setting sun. Just a brief glimpse at your\
 mobile phone at bedtime is enough to expose your retinas to artificial light, so fighting such\
 a comprehensive intrusion might be an exercise in futility. But even if we can’t completely\
 (line 80) quench our thirst for light, we can all make one small gesture, which could prompt us to\
 unplug a little more. …\

 Reading Comprehension Passage A\
 \
 The Count and the Wedding Guest\
 \
    Miss Maggie Conway and Mr. Andy Donovan are staying at the same boarding house in New York City.\
 \
    …Just coming out the door was Miss Conway. She wore a night-black dress of\
 crêpe de—crêpe de—oh, this thin black goods.(goods - fabric) Her hat was black, and from it drooped and\
 fluttered an ebon veil, filmy as a spider’s web. She stood on the top step and drew on black\
 silk gloves. Not a speck of white or a spot of color about her dress anywhere. Her rich\
 (line 5) golden hair was drawn, with scarcely a ripple, into a shining, smooth knot low on her neck.\
 Her face was plain rather than pretty, but it was now illuminated and made almost beautiful\
 by her large gray eyes that gazed above the houses across the street into the sky with an\
 expression of the most appealing sadness and melancholy. …\
    “It’s a fine, clear evening, Miss Conway,” he [Andy Donovan] said; and if the Weather\
 (line 10) Bureau could have heard the confident emphasis of his tones it would have hoisted the\
 square white signal, (square white signal - a sign of good weather) and nailed it to the mast.\
    “To them that has the heart to enjoy it, it is, Mr. Donovan,” said Miss Conway, with\
 a sigh. …\
    “I hope none of your relatives—I hope you haven’t sustained a loss?” ventured\
 (line 15) Mr. Donovan.\
    “Death has claimed,” said Miss Conway, hesitating—“not a relative, but one who—but\
 I will not intrude my grief upon you, Mr. Donovan.”\
    “Intrude?” protested Mr. Donovan. “Why, say, Miss Conway, I’d be delighted, that is,\
 I’d be sorry—I mean I’m sure nobody could sympathize with you truer than I would.”\
 (line 20)   Miss Conway smiled a little smile. And oh, it was sadder than her expression in repose. (repose - at rest) …\
    “It’s tough to be alone in New York—that’s a cinch,” said Mr. Donovan. “But, say—\
 whenever this little old town does loosen up and get friendly it goes the limit. Say you took\
 a little stroll in the park, Miss Conway—don’t you think it might chase away some of your\
 mullygrubs? And if you’d allow me—”\
 (line 25)   “Thanks, Mr. Donovan. I’d be pleased to accept of your escort if you think the company\
 of one whose heart is filled with gloom could be anyways agreeable to you.”\
    Through the open gates of the iron-railed, old, downtown park, where the elect once\
 took the air, they strolled, and found a quiet bench. …\
    “He was my fiancé,” confided Miss Conway, at the end of an hour. “We were going to\
 (line 30) be married next spring. I don’t want you to think that I am stringing you, Mr. Donovan, but\
 he was a real Count. He had an estate and a castle in Italy. Count Fernando Mazzini was\
 his name. I never saw the beat of him for elegance. Papa objected, of course, and once \
 we eloped, but papa overtook us, and took us back. I thought sure papa and Fernando \
 would fight a duel. Papa has a livery business—in P’kipsee [Poughkeepsie], you know.” … \
 (line 35)    “Three days ago I got a letter from Italy, forwarded from P’kipsee, saying that Fernando \
 had been killed in a gondola accident.” … \
    “I’ve got his picture here in my locket,” said Miss Conway, after wiping her eyes with \
 her handkerchief. “I never showed it to anybody; but I will to you, Mr. Donovan, because \
 I believe you to be a true friend.” \
 (line 40)   Mr. Donovan gazed long and with much interest at the photograph in the locket that \
 Miss Conway opened for him. The face of Count Mazzini was one to command interest. \
 It was a smooth, intelligent, bright, almost a handsome face—the face of a strong, cheerful \
 man who might well be a leader among his fellows. \
    “I have a larger one, framed, in my room,” said Miss Conway. “When we return I will\
 (line 45) show you that. They are all I have to remind me of Fernando. But he ever will be present \
 in my heart, that’s a sure thing.” \
    A subtle task confronted Mr. Donovan,—that of supplanting (supplanting - replacing) the unfortunate Count in \
 the heart of Miss Conway. This his admiration for her determined him to do. But the \
 magnitude of the undertaking did not seem to weigh upon his spirits. The sympathetic but\
 (line 50) cheerful friend was the role he essayed; (essayed - attempted) and he played it so successfully that the next \
 half-hour found them conversing pensively across two plates of ice-cream, though yet there \
 was no diminution of the sadness in Miss Conway’s large gray eyes. \
    Before they parted in the hall that evening she ran upstairs and brought down the \
 framed photograph wrapped lovingly in a white silk scarf. Mr. Donovan surveyed it with\
 (line 55) inscrutable (inscrutable - unreadable) eyes. … \
    “A fine-looking man,” said Mr. Donovan, heartily. “How would it suit you, Miss Conway, \
 to give me the pleasure of your company to Coney [Island] next Sunday afternoon?” \
    A month later they announced their engagement to Mrs. Scott and the other boarders. \
 Miss Conway continued to wear black.\
 (line 60)   A week after the announcement the two sat on the same bench in the downtown park, \
 while the fluttering leaves of the trees made a dim kinetoscopic (kinetoscopic - flickering) picture of them in the \
 moonlight. But Donovan had worn a look of abstracted gloom all day. He was so silent \
 to-night that love’s lips could not keep back any longer the questions that love’s heart \
 propounded. (propounded - put forward)\
 (line 65)   “What’s the matter, Andy, you are so solemn and grouchy to-night?”\
    “Nothing, Maggie.”\
    “I know better. Can’t I tell? You never acted this way before. What is it?” … \
    “I’ll tell you then,” said Andy, wisely, “but I guess you won’t understand it exactly. \
 You’ve heard of Mike Sullivan, haven’t you? ‘Big Mike’ Sullivan, everybody calls him.”\
 (line 70)   “No, I haven’t,” said Maggie. “And I don’t want to, if he makes you act like this. Who is \
 he?” …\
    “Well, Big Mike’s a friend of mine. I ain’t more than deuce-high in the district as far as \
 influence goes, but Mike’s as good a friend to a little man, or a poor man as he is to a big \
 one. I met him to-day on the Bowery [Street], and what do you think he does? Comes up\
 (line 75) and shakes hands. ‘Andy,’ says he, ‘I’ve been keeping cases on you. You’ve been putting in \
 some good licks over on your side of the street, and I’m proud of you. What’ll you take to \
 drink?’ He takes a cigar, and I take a highball. I told him I was going to get married in two \
 weeks. ‘Andy,’ says he, ‘send me an invitation, so I’ll keep in mind of it, and I’ll come to the \
 wedding.’ That’s what Big Mike says to me; and he always does what he says. \
 (line 80)   “You don’t understand it, Maggie, but I’d have one of my hands cut off to have Big Mike \
 Sullivan at our wedding. It would be the proudest day of my life. When he goes to a man’s \
 wedding, there’s a guy being married that’s made for life. Now, that’s why I’m maybe looking \
 sore to-night.”\
    “Why don’t you invite him, then, if he’s so much to the mustard?” (to the mustard - successful) said Maggie, lightly. …\
 (line 85)   “Maggie,” said Andy, presently, “do you think as much of me as you did of your—as you \
 did of the Count Mazzini?”\
    He waited a long time, but Maggie did not reply. And then, suddenly she leaned against \
 his shoulder and began to cry—to cry and shake with sobs, holding his arm tightly, and \
 wetting the crêpe de Chine with tears. …\
 (line 90)   But instead of being pushed away, she found Andy’s arm folding her closer. She looked \
 up and saw his face cleared and smiling. …\
    “Andy,” said Maggie, with a somewhat shy smile, after she had been thoroughly assured \
 of forgiveness, “did you believe all that story about the Count?” \
    “Well, not to any large extent,” said Andy, reaching for his cigar case, “because it’s\
 (line 95) Big Mike Sullivan’s picture you’ve got in that locket of yours.” \

What Do Flies Think About?\
 From Ideas & Discoveries Magazine\
 \
 It seems unbelievable, but an insect’s brain is more brilliant than any supercomputer.\
 That’s why researchers are studying flies and bees to understand their cognition. Food for\
 thought . . .\
 Though it may seem like a mundane question, there is serious science behind it: Why\
 (line 5) is a common housefly able to land on a ceiling? After all, the insect flies with its feet down\
 when it’s below the ceiling, yet, in the blink of an eye, the fly is suddenly perched with feet\
 upward. The explanation for the fly’s aerial feat is important because it can reveal a lot\
 about what the insect’s brain is capable of: Regardless of how the fly manages the landing,\
 its tiny brain (which consists of only 100,000 nerve cells) has to go into high gear to carry\
 (line 10) it out. For a long time, scientists believed the flies turn around in flight much like a fighter\
 pilot performs loops. This would require them to first “visualize” a mental rotation—in\
 other words, to plan the loop beforehand.\
 It was only recently that researchers discovered how a fly actually lands on a ceiling.\
 Using a high-speed camera, they discovered that flies don’t perform a loop after all.\
 (line 15) Instead, they stretch out their front legs over their head and toward the ceiling. As soon as\
 the legs make contact with the ceiling, the fly swings its body around 180 degrees like a\
 gymnast on a horizontal bar. Then it simply attaches itself to the ceiling with all its legs.\
 This precision landing requires perfect coordination of all its muscles. The fly’s swinging\
 motion also needs to be calculated, which means information shoots through its body in\
 (line 20) the space of milliseconds. Not even an autopilot system controlled by a high-tech\
 computer could carry out such a maneuver.\
 Bees are a favorite experimental creature for researchers because they are easy to breed\
 and are considered the “Einsteins” of the insect world. These striped geniuses perform\
 intellectual feats that cannot be taken for granted, even among mammals. Bees can count,\
 (line 25) distinguish between objects like humans and dogs, recognize complex shapes, learn things,\
 navigate across great distances and remember their routes, and return to their hives and\
 tell other bees exactly where the tastiest flowers are. Compare that with the difficulties\
 humans can have when finding their way around an unfamiliar city without a map—not\
 to mention having to describe to friends the route they took. “Brain size is not necessarily\
 (line 30) an indicator of intelligence,” says bee researcher Lars Chittka at Queen Mary, University of\
 London. “Larger brains usually utilize the same circuits over and over again. This might\
 make for more detailed thinking or remembering, but it doesn’t guarantee the thoughts or\
 memories will be better.”\
 Bees are also social insects that create complex colony systems and display a high\
 (line 35) degree of social behavior. The idea of life in a group is firmly rooted in their brains—\
 which is what makes bees so interesting to brain researchers. We, too, are social creatures,\
 after all, and scientists suspect that certain neuronal circuits have changed very little over\
 the course of evolution. In other words, bee brains could provide us with information on\
 nerve connections that will help us better understand our own human nature and how we\
 (line 40) think.\
 Researchers already know that insects living in groups need to have more computing\
 power in their head. This is illustrated by the fact that all social insects have a larger brain\
 than their loner counterparts. A key factor in this discovery was a study conducted by\
 biologists at a Smithsonian lab in Panama. The country is home to a bee species that\
 (line 45) contains some members that live alone and others that form groups. The biologists\
 discovered that the loner bees also had a smaller brain. So it appears that a larger brain is\
 a consequence of group living. The same phenomenon is even more pronounced among\
 several species of locusts that begin life alone and later join up to form giant swarms: As\
 soon as they get together, their brains begin to grow by one-third. It’s likely they need to\
 (line 50) possess greater thinking capacity in order to compete with rivals in the swarm. It’s also\
 likely that flying and communicating in a swarm is more difficult than doing those things\
 alone. The biologists still don’t know how locusts get their brains to grow. The\
 explanation, should it be found, might be of interest to medical researchers looking into\
 treatments for paralysis or strokes. In any case, the researchers have found substances in\
 (line 55) the locusts’ brain that are extremely effective at killing bacteria. These substances are not\
 related to any known antibiotics, so they could possibly pave the way for new medications\
 in the future.\
 Such discoveries are definitely pointing scientists in a new direction. However,\
 practically no insect brain researcher has gone as far as Atsushi Takashima at the Tokyo\
 (line 60) Institute of Technology in Japan. Takashima has inserted electrodes into the brains of male\
 moths that he then uses as control units for a robot. Whenever the moth-machine hybrid\
 catches the scent of a female moth, it begins to search for the source. “Chemical\
 substances do not spread out uniformly in air,” Takashima explains. “So even though their\
 concentrations increase as you get closer to their source, the effects of wind and air\
 (line 65) currents make an analysis extremely difficult. But thanks to evolution, insect brains have\
 developed techniques to get around this problem.” Takashima’s research has significant\
 applications: His goal is to create robots that can sniff out explosives or dangerous\
 chemicals in the air and locate their source. One day a processor will control such robots,\
 but for now, a moth’s brain is far superior to any supercomputer on the market.\
Lines 58 through 69 suggest that the author believes\
(A) the study of moths will reveal changes in insect brains\
 (B) the study of moths can provide ways to enhance technology\
 (C) moth research will teach scientists more about the human brain\
 (D) scientists should develop more advanced methods of moth research\

 Excerpt from River of Dreams\
 by Hudson Talbott\
 \
 (paragraph 1) By the twentieth century, New York City had long since reached its destiny of\
 becoming the most powerful city in America. In less than 300 years it had grown from\
 a tiny Dutch outpost in the wilderness to the business capital of the world. It was a city\
 built on dreams.\
 (paragraph 2) But it was made out of bricks and cement that had come from the banks of the\
 Hudson. The river which had fed all those dreams was now fading into the background.\
 New York didn’t seem to need the river anymore, except as a sewer. And that’s what it\
 became.\
 (paragraph 3) Industry on the river had made some New Yorkers filthy rich. But it had just made\
 the river filthy. Garbage, factory waste, plant chemicals and the raw sewage of the cities\
 and towns along its banks were dumped directly into the river. The water turned\
 greenish brown, except by the GM plant, where it turned red or yellow or whatever\
 color they were painting the cars that day.\
 (paragraph 4) The fishing industry collapsed. The few fish that survived were too poisonous to eat.\
 Smog from the factory smoke and dust from the cement plants blanketed the valley.\
 And it was all legal.\
 (paragraph 5) Most people don’t start out with dreams of polluting a river. But it was often the\
 result of people chasing their dreams of wealth with little care of how they reached it.\
 The Hudson Valley had always drawn them.\
 (paragraph 6) But now there were other dreamers in the valley, with their own dreams of wealth.\
 They dreamed of the wealth of wildlife in a healthy forest, the abundance of fish in\
 oxygen-rich water, and the great fortune of living in a beautiful river valley.\
 (paragraph 7) So perhaps it was a matter of time before the two types of dreamers would meet each\
 other—in court.\
 (paragraph 8) In 1963, Con Edison, New York City’s power company, proposed a plan for\
 constructing the largest hydroelectric pumping station ever built. The plan called for\
 carving out a gigantic hole in the side of majestic Storm King Mountain on the Hudson\
 River.\
 (paragraph 9) But then they met Franny Reese. Franny was a longtime valley resident with a simple\
 point to make: the mountain could not speak for itself. If she didn’t speak for it, who\
 would?\
 (paragraph 10) Franny and a group of like-minded people founded Scenic Hudson and took on the\
 power company in a landmark court case. Con Ed challenged the right of private\
 citizens to participate, but the court sided with the citizens, in the ruling now known as\
 the Scenic Hudson Decision.\
 (paragraph 11) After dragging out the case for seventeen years, Con Ed finally gave up and Storm\
 King survived unblemished. It was the beginning of the environmental movement in\
 this country, and once again, the Hudson Valley was the birthplace.\
 (paragraph 12) More and more people joined the movement as they realized how much difference\
 each of us can make.\
 (paragraph 13) The love of their land was still alive in the hearts of Americans, and now that it was\
 aroused again, things began to change.\
 (paragraph 14) Many new laws and new citizens’ groups have been inspired by those early heroes of\
 the environment, and their work has begun to bring the Hudson back to life.\
 (paragraph 15) The Mahicans called it “The River That Flows Both Ways.” Slowly we are learning\
 that taking care of the river is the only way that the river can take care of us.\
 (paragraph 16) Fifty years have passed since I dreamed of going to New York to see the river that\
 shares my name, and thirty-five years since that dream came true. I live in the Hudson\
 Valley now, grateful to all those who came before me, following their dreams to this\
 river, building this nation, sharing its beauty, securing its future.\
 (paragraph 17) It’s now my turn to help in keeping the river of dreams flowing, for all those\
 dreamers yet to come.\
Which claim from the article is least supported?\
(A) “New York didn’t seem to need the river anymore, except as a sewer. And that’s what it became.” (paragraph 2)\
 (B) “Industry on the river had made some New Yorkers filthy rich.” (paragraph 3)\
 (C) “But it had just made the river filthy.” (paragraph 3)\
 (D) “But now there were other dreamers in the valley, with their own dreams of wealth.” (paragraph 6)\

Excerpt from “The Beadwork” from American Indian Stories\
 \
 by Zitkala-Sa\
 \
 (paragraph 1) Soon after breakfast mother sometimes began her beadwork. On a bright, clear day, she pulled out the wooden pegs that pinned the skirt of our wigwam to the ground, and rolled the canvas part way up on its frame of slender poles. Then the cool morning breezes swept freely through our dwelling, now and then wafting the perfume of sweet grasses from the newly burnt prairie.\
 \
 (paragraph 2) Untying the long tasseled strings that bound a small brown buckskin bag, my mother spread upon a mat beside her bunches of colored beads, just as an artist arranges the paints upon his palette. On a lapboard she smoothed out a double sheet of soft white buckskin; and drawing from a beaded case that hung on the left of her wide\
 belt a long, narrow blade, she trimmed the buckskin into shape. Often she worked upon small moccasins for her small daughter. Then I became intensely interested in her designing. With a proud, beaming face, I watched her work. In imagination, I saw myself walking in a new pair of snugly fitting moccasins. I felt the envious eyes of my playmates upon the pretty red beads decorating my feet.\
 \
 (paragraph 3) Close beside my mother I sat on a rug, with a scrap of buckskin in one hand and an awl in the other. This was the beginning of my practical observation lessons in the art of beadwork. From a skein of finely twisted threads of silvery sinews my mother pulled out a single one. With an awl she pierced the buckskin, and skillfully threaded it with the white sinew. Picking up the tiny beads one by one, she strung them with the point of her thread, always twisting it carefully after every stitch. . . .\
 \
 (paragraph 4) Always after these confining lessons I was wild with surplus spirits, and found joyous relief in running loose in the open again. Many a summer afternoon a party of four or five of my playmates roamed over the hills with me. We each carried a light, sharpened rod about four feet long, with which we pried up certain sweet roots. When we had eaten all the choice roots we chanced upon, we shouldered our rods and strayed off into patches of a stalky plant under whose yellow blossoms we found little crystal drops of gum. Drop by drop we gathered this nature’s rock-candy, until each of us could boast of a lump the size of a small bird’s egg. Soon satiated (satiated - completely satisfied) with its woody flavor, we tossed away our gum, to return again to the sweet roots.\
 \
 (paragraph 5) I remember well how we used to exchange our necklaces, beaded belts, and sometimes even our moccasins. We pretended to offer them as gifts to one another. We delighted in impersonating our own mothers. We talked of things we had heard them say in their conversations. We imitated their various manners, even to the inflection of their voices. In the lap of the prairie we seated ourselves upon our feet, and leaning our painted cheeks in the palms of our hands, we rested our elbows on our knees, and bent forward as old women were most accustomed to do.\
 \
 (paragraph 6) While one was telling of some heroic deed recently done by a near relative, the rest of us listened attentively, and exclaimed in undertones “Han! han!” (yes! yes!) whenever the speaker paused for breath, or sometimes for our sympathy. As the discourse became more thrilling, according to our ideas, we raised our voices in these interjections. In these impersonations our parents were led to say only those things that were in common favor.\
 \
 (paragraph 7) No matter how exciting a tale we might be rehearsing, the mere shifting of a cloud shadow in the landscape near by was sufficient to change our impulses; and soon we were all chasing the great shadows that played among the hills. We shouted and whooped in the chase; laughing and calling to one another, we were like little sportive nymphs (sportive nymphs - playful creatures of the woods) on that Dakota sea of rolling green.\
 \
 (paragraph 8) On one occasion I forgot the cloud shadow in a strange notion to catch up with my own shadow. Standing straight and still, I began to glide after it, putting out one foot cautiously. When, with the greatest care, I set my foot in advance of myself, my shadow crept onward too. Then again I tried it; this time with the other foot. Still again my shadow escaped me. I began to run; and away flew my shadow, always just a step beyond me. Faster and faster I ran, setting my teeth and clenching my fists, determined to overtake my own fleet shadow. But ever swifter it glided before me while I was growing breathless and hot. Slackening my speed, I was greatly vexed that my shadow should check its pace also. Daring it to the utmost, as I thought, I sat down upon a rock imbedded in the hillside.\
 \
 (paragraph 9) So! my shadow had the impudence (impudence - nerve) to sit down beside me!\
 \
 (paragraph 10) Now my comrades caught up with me, and began to ask why I was running away so fast.\
 \
 (paragraph 11) “Oh, I was chasing my shadow! Didn’t you ever do that?” I inquired, surprised that they should not understand.\
 \
 (paragraph 12) They planted their moccasined feet firmly upon my shadow to stay it, and I arose. Again my shadow slipped away, and moved as often as I did. Then we gave up trying to catch my shadow.\
 \
 (paragraph 13) Before this peculiar experience, I have no distinct memory of having recognized any vital bond between myself and my shadow. I never gave it an afterthought.\
 \
 (paragraph 14) Returning to our borrowed belts and trinkets, we rambled homeward. That evening, as on other evenings, I went to sleep over my legends.\
What similarity is shared between the events in paragraph 3 and the events in paragraph 4?\
(A) Both paragraphs emphasize the value of honoring family traditions.\
 (B) Both paragraphs describe the ability to use tools with precision.\
 (C) Both paragraphs demonstrate how teachers inspire others.\
 (D) Both paragraphs highlight the joys of friendship and play.\

 Excerpt from Snowflake Bentley\
 by Jacqueline Briggs Martin\
 \
 (paragraph 1) In the days when farmers worked with ox and sled and cut the dark with lantern light, there lived a boy who loved snow more than anything in the world. Willie Bentley’s happiest days were snowstorm days. He watched snowflakes on his mittens, on the dried grass of Vermont farm fields, on the dark metal handle of the barn door. He said snow was as beautiful as butterflies, or apple blossoms.\
 \
 (paragraph 2) He could net butterflies and show them to his older brother, Charlie. He could pick apple blossoms and take them to his mother. But he could not share snowflakes because he could not save them.\
 \
 (paragraph 3) When his mother gave him an old microscope, he used it to look at flowers, raindrops, and blades of grass. Best of all, he used it to look at snow. While other children built forts and pelted snowballs at roosting crows, Willie was catching snowflakes. Day after stormy day he studied the icy crystals.\
 \
 (paragraph 4) Their intricate patterns were even more beautiful than he had imagined. He expected to find whole flakes that were the same, that were copies of each other. But he never did. Willie decided he must find a way to save snowflakes so others could see their wonderful designs. For three winters he tried drawing snow crystals. They always melted before he could finish.\
 \
 (paragraph 5) When he was sixteen, Willie read of a camera with its own microscope. “If I had that camera I could photograph snowflakes,” he told his mother. Willie’s mother knew that he would not be happy until he could share what he had seen.\
 \
 (paragraph6) “Fussing with snow is just foolishness,” his father said. Still, he loved his son. When Willie was seventeen his parents spent their savings and bought the camera. It was taller than a newborn calf, and cost as much as his father’s herd of ten cows. Willie was sure it was the best of all cameras.\
 \
 (paragraph 7) Even so his first pictures were failures—no better than shadows. Yet he would not quit. Mistake by mistake, snowflake by snowflake, Willie worked through every storm. Winter ended, the snow melted, and he had no good pictures. He waited for another season of snow. One day, in the second winter, he tried a new experiment. And it\
 worked! Willie had figured out how to photograph snowflakes! “Now everyone can see the great beauty in a tiny crystal,” he said.\
 \
 (paragraph 8) But in those days, no one cared. Neighbors laughed at the idea of photographing snow. “Snow in Vermont is as common as dirt,” they said. “We don’t need pictures.” Willie said the photographs would be his gift to the world. While other farmers sat by the fire or rode to town with horse and sleigh, Willie studied snowstorms. He stood at the shed door and held out a black tray to catch the flakes.\
 \
 (paragraph 9) When he found only jumbled, broken crystals, he brushed the tray clean with a turkey feather and held it out again. He waited hours for just the right crystal and didn’t notice the cold. If the shed were warm the snow would melt. If he breathed on the black tray the snow would melt. If he twitched a muscle as he held the snow crystal on the long wood pick the snowflake would break. He had to work fast or the snowflake would evaporate before he could slide it into place and take its picture. Some winters he was able to make only a few dozen good pictures. Some winters he made hundreds. . . .\
 \
 (paragraph 10) But his snow crystal pictures were always his favorites. He gave copies away or sold them for a few cents. He made special pictures as gifts for birthdays. He held evening slide shows on the lawns of his friends. Children and adults sat on the grass and watched while Willie projected his slides onto a sheet hung over a clothesline.\
 \
 (paragraph 11) He wrote about snow and published his pictures in magazines. He gave speeches about snow to faraway scholars and neighborhood skywatchers. “You are doing great work,” said a professor from Wisconsin. The little farmer came to be known as the world’s expert on snow, “the Snowflake Man.” But he never grew rich. He spent every\
 penny on his pictures. Willie said there were treasures in snow. “I can’t afford to miss a single snowstorm,” he told a friend. “I never know when I will find some wonderful prize.”\
What does the information in paragraph 9 suggest about the author’s point of view?\
(A) The author believes that Bentley could have been more careful.\
 (B) The author respects Bentley’s many different interests.\
 (C) The author admires Bentley’s dedication.\

Reading Comprehension Passage C\
 Many Animals Can Count, Some Better Than You\
 \
 Every night during breeding season, the male túngara frog of Central America will stake\
 out a performance patch in the local pond and spend unbroken hours broadcasting\
 his splendor to the world.\
 The mud-brown frog is barely the size of a shelled pecan, but his call is large and\
 (line 5) dynamic, a long downward sweep that sounds remarkably like a phaser weapon on\
 \"Star Trek,\" followed by a brief, twangy, harmonically dense chuck.(chuck - a clucking sound)\
 Unless, that is, a competing male starts calling nearby, in which case the first frog is\
 likely to add two chucks to the tail of his sweep. And should his rival respond likewise,\
 Male A will tack on three chucks.\
 (line 10) Back and forth they go, call and raise, until the frogs hit their respiratory limit at six\
 to seven rapid-fire chucks.\
 The acoustic one-upfrogship is energetically draining and risks attracting predators like\
 bats. Yet the male frogs have no choice but to keep count of the competition, for the simple\
 reason that female túngaras are doing the same: listening, counting and ultimately mating\
 (line 15) with the male of maximum chucks.\
 Behind the frog’s surprisingly sophisticated number sense, scientists have found, are\
 specialized cells in the amphibian midbrain that tally up sound signals and the intervals\
 between them.\
 \"The neurons are counting the number of appropriate pulses, and they’re highly\
 (line 20) selective,\" said Gary Rose, a biologist at the University of Utah. If the timing between\
 pulses is off by just a fraction of a second, the neurons don’t fire and the counting process\
 breaks down. …\
 Scientists have found that animals across the evolutionary spectrum have a keen sense\
 of quantity, able to distinguish not just bigger from smaller or more from less, but two from\
 (line 25) four, four from ten, forty from sixty.\
 Orb-weaving spiders, for example, keep a tally of how many silk-wrapped prey items are\
 stashed in the \"larder\" segment of their web. When scientists experimentally remove the\
 cache, the spiders will spend time searching for the stolen goods in proportion to how many\
 separate items had been taken, rather than how big the total prey mass might have been.\
 (line 30) Small fish benefit from living in schools, and the more numerous the group, the\
 statistically better a fish’s odds of escaping predation. As a result, many shoaling (shoaling - shallow water) fish are\
 excellent appraisers of relative head counts.\
 Guppies, for example, have a so-called contrast ratio of .8, which means they can\
 distinguish at a glance between four guppies and five, or eight guppies and ten, and if given\
 (line 35) the chance will swim toward the slightly fishier crowd.\
 Three-spined sticklebacks (sticklebacks - carnivorous fish) are more discriminating still: with a contrast ratio of .86,\
 they’re able to tell six fellow fish from seven, or 18 from 21 — a comparative power that\
 many birds, mammals and even humans might find hard to beat.\
 Despite the prevalence of math phobia, people too are born with a strong innate\
 (line 40) number sense, and numerosity is deeply embedded in many aspects of our minds and\
 culture.\
 Researchers have determined that number words for small quantities — less than five —\
 are strikingly similar across virtually every language studied, and the words are among the\
 most stable, unchanging utterances in any lexicon. (lexicon - language)\
 (line 45) They are more conserved through time and across cultures than words for other\
 presumably bedrock concepts like mother, father and most body parts, with a few puzzling\
 exceptions like the words for tongue and eye.\
 \"The sounds that you and I use to say ‘two’ or ‘three’ are the sounds that have been used\
 for tens of thousands of years,\" said Mark Pagel, a biologist who studies the evolution of\
 (line 50) language at the University of Reading.\
 \"It’s not out of the question that you could have been wandering around 15,000 years\
 ago and encountered a few of the last remaining Neanderthals, pointed to yourself and said,\
 ‘one,’ and pointed to them and said, ‘three,’ and those words, in an odd, coarse way, would\
 have been understood.\"\
 (line 55) That continuity, Dr. Pagel added, \"should astonish us.\" …\
 Attitudes about animal numerosity have changed dramatically since the mid-twentieth\
 century when many researchers believed only humans had enough gray matter to think\
 quantitatively. They cited as an object lesson the 1907 case of Clever Hans, the horse that\
 supposedly could solve arithmetic problems and would tap out his answers by hoof; as it\
 (line 60) turned out, he was responding to unconscious cues from the people around him.\
 Since then, researchers have approached the field with caution and rigor, seeking to\
 identify the specific evolutionary pressures that might spur the need for numeric judgments\
 in any given species.\
 Social carnivores like spotted hyenas, for example, live in fission-fusion societies, (fission-fusion societies - animals whose social group composition and size change as they move throughout their environment)\
 (line 65) collectively defending their territories against rivals but in ever-shifting groups of widely\
 roaming members. \"You can never predict who you’ll find in which group,\" said Sarah\
 Benson-Amram, an assistant professor of zoology and physiology at the University of\
 Wyoming. \"You might be alone or in a group of ten.\"\
 Because hyena jaws can pulverize zebra bones, encounters between [rival hyena]\
 (line 70) competitors can prove deadly; every spotted hyena must have a good sense from moment\
 to moment of how many there are of us versus how many of them. Dr. Benson-Amram and\
 her colleagues tested hyena numerosity skills in the field, playing back the recorded whoops\
 of spotted hyenas living in South Africa and Namibia to hyenas in Kenya.\
 The Kenyan carnivores reacted to the whoops of strangers as predicted, approaching\
 (line 75)\
 the hidden source of the sound when they had a home team advantage, retreating when\
 they heard a few too many distinctive voices in a row. Or sometimes, when the local hyenas\
 were outnumbered, they’d call for backup. …\
 Chimpanzees are social scorekeepers, episodic (episodic - periodic) warriors and number ninjas, too.\
 They can be taught to associate groups of objects with corresponding Arabic numerals up\
 (line 80) to the number 9 and sometimes beyond — three squares on a computer screen with the\
 number 3, five squares with 5, and so on. They can put those numerals in order.\
 The numeric working memory of young chimpanzees is astonishing: Flash a random\
 scattering of numerals on a screen for just 210 milliseconds — half an eye blink — and then\
 cover the numbers with white squares, and a numerically schooled young chimpanzee will\
 (line 85) touch the squares sequentially to indicate the ascending order of the numbers hidden\
 beneath.\
 Don’t bother trying to do this yourself, Tetsuro Matsuzawa, a primatologist at Kyoto\
 University, said at the scientific meeting in London on which the themed journal (the themed journal - a publication where animal numerosity studies were discussed) was based.\
 \"You can’t.\" …\
 (line 90) Stanislas Dehaene, a psychologist at the University of Paris, and his colleagues\
 presented evidence from brain scans of professional mathematicians that the neural\
 circuitry (neural circuitry - nerve cells) for advanced mathematical thinking is an elaboration on the archaic (archaic - primitive) number sense\
 we share with other animals. …\
 We hear that the price of something rose by 50 percent and then fell by 50 percent, and\
 (line 95) we reflexively, mistakenly conclude, \"Oh good, we’re back to where we started.\" Our natural\
 number sense adds and subtracts whole numbers, whole chucks, guppies and hyenas.\
 But it really abhors a fraction, and so has led us astray.\

 Excerpt from The Woolly-Puff Rescue\
 \
 by Sue Mozena\
 \
 (paragraph 1) Wendy and Alex stared at the strange ﬂower at their feet. Dozens of them bloomed in this remote corner of the ﬁeld.\
 \
 (paragraph 2) Wendy bent down for a closer look. “We shouldn’t name them until we’re sure we can keep them,” she warned. “But I like Woolly-Puffs. They look just like ﬂeecy rainbows.”\
 \
 (paragraph 3) As tempting as it was to pet the feathery yellow-orange-red-purple-blue petals, neither of them did. Instead, Wendy pulled protective gloves from her belt pack.\
 \
 (paragraph 4) On the asteroid-based colony of New Harmony, even twelve-year-old pioneers knew the number one rule for living in outer space: don’t touch or taste or sniff anything that hasn’t been tested.\
 \
 (paragraph 5) “Where do you think they came from?” Wendy asked. With a gentle tug, she freed a Woolly-Puff from the thin layer of soil, sealed it in a clear bag.\
 \
 (paragraph 6) “They were probably in the compost shipment that brought these naggers,” Alex muttered. He slapped at one of the whining insects that swarmed around him looking for exposed skin to bite.\
 \
 compost = a mixture of decaying plants used to improve the soil in a garden\
 \
 (paragraph 7) New Harmony depended on shipments of rich compost from nearby planets to build up its soil. Usually the compost was treated before it arrived, but one shipment had been accidentally overlooked. The whining gnat-like insects the colonists called “naggers” had hatched from the compost. Without any natural enemies in this new world, the insects had multiplied, becoming a constant torment to the colonists.\
 \
 (paragraph 8) After turning in their discovery, Wendy settled on a stone bench in front of the New Harmony laboratory. Alex paced, then sat. “Poor Woolly-Puff,” Wendy said. “What if it’s just a weedy ﬂower?”\
 \
 (paragraph 9) “Then one living plant and a packet of seeds will be sent to the Botany Preserve on Mars,” Alex answered, rubbing a hot-pink nagger welt just above his elbow.\
 \
 (paragraph 10) Wendy gingerly held the extra bouquet she had picked, in case the Woolly-Puffs proved keepers. “And the rest of the plants—”\
 \
 (paragraph 11) “The rest will be pulled up and destroyed to make room for ‘useful’ plants,” Alex said.\
 \
 (paragraph 12) The colony of New Harmony did have ﬂowers. It just didn’t have a lot of room. Woolly-Puffs would have to be more than pretty if they wanted to grow here.\
 \
 (paragraph 13) The two friends scrambled to attention as the lab door opened.\
 \
 (paragraph 14) “Your Woolly-Puff isn’t toxic,” Professor Raglin said. His smile faded as he went on. “The sap is thick and sticky, but we already have a good glue. The stems are too woody and the leaves too bristly to eat. And the petals, well, they smell funny. Not ﬂowery at all. More like moldy lemons. I’m sorry, but I’ll have to make my report to the council this afternoon. The good news is that they seem to grow only in the soil where you found them, so it won’t be hard to get rid of them.”\
 \
 (paragraph 15) “At least they’re not poison,” Wendy said after Professor Raglin had left. She hugged her colorful, fuzzy bouquet. She had to admit they did smell funny. “Mayor Murphy will probably send a reclaim crew out after the council meeting.” She sighed. “I wish the council would let us adopt one, like a pet.”\
 \
 (paragraph 16) “Fat chance,” Alex said. He blew at a pair of naggers trying to land on his knee. “Shoo! For harmless gnats, these bugs sure are pests.”\
 \
 (paragraph 17) “Yeah.” Wendy reached up to scratch the end of her nose. Then she realized something. The end of her nose itched simply because that’s what the ends of noses do sometimes. The naggers weren’t biting her. They weren’t even landing on her.\
 \
 (paragraph 18) “We’re going to the council meeting,” she announced.\
 \
 (paragraph 19) That afternoon, when the council members emerged from the community center, Alex and Wendy were waiting.\
 \
 (paragraph 20) “What is the meaning of this?” Mayor Murphy demanded as Alex and Wendy presented each member of the council with a Woolly-Puff garland.\
 \
 (paragraph 21) Glancing at Alex for courage, Wendy said, “Woolly-Puffs are bug chasers.”\
 \
 (paragraph 22) “Sorry,” Mayor Murphy said ﬁrmly. “We have already made our decision.”\
 \
 (paragraph 23) “Just watch,” Wendy pleaded. “Watch the naggers.”\
 \
 (paragraph 24) Then someone said, “What naggers? I don’t see any.”\
 \
 (paragraph 25) “Where are the naggers?” asked Professor Raglin. “It’s as if they’re avoiding us.”\
 \
 (paragraph 26) Wendy smiled. “They are. Naggers don’t like Woolly-Puffs.”\
 \
 (paragraph 27) So the Woolly-Puffs stayed in the vases and ﬂower boxes and gardens of New Harmony because, of course, they weren’t just pretty. They smelled like moldy lemons. And luckily, naggers couldn’t stand the smell of moldy lemons.\

. . . Yet in recent months something has changed. Kim Jong Il, whose regime was responsible for the first test and who died in 2011, had only a rudimentary [basic] nuclear device, useful mainly for blackmail. Under his son, Kim Jong Un, the programme has rapidly gathered pace, with two nuclear tests this year alone. The North has also conducted 21 missile tests this year, including one from a submarine—a first. The ability to miniaturise a tactical nuclear weapon on a working missile could be just two or three years away, with an intercontinental ballistic missile capable of hitting California possible in five years’ time. Chun Yung-woo, a South Korean former national security adviser, talks of “growing outrage. . .after five tests, a change of mood, a sense of urgency.”\
 \
 Once, it was possible to hope that the North’s isolated regime would implode [fail] under its own contradictions before it gained a proper nuclear capability. But the spread of informal markets and, for some North Koreans, a measure of prosperity may have strengthened the regime’s chances of survival. A consensus in Seoul is forming that Mr Kim now aims to dictate events on the peninsula—including the ability to demand that the Americans leave. One senior foreign diplomat in Seoul says that for the first time he hears people wondering openly whether there will be a major conflict on the peninsula in their lifetime. . . .\

 Reading Comprehension Passage A\
 \
 Caramelo\
 \
    One would think now that she was living in Chicago, in the same city as her [favorite son] \
 Inocencio, the Grandmother would find happiness. But no, that wasn’t the case. The \
 Grandmother was meaner than ever. She was unhappy. And didn’t know she was unhappy, \
 the worst kind of unhappiness of all. As a result, everyone was in a hurry to find her a house\
 (line 5) of some sort. A bungalow, a duplex, a brownstone, an apartment. Something, anything, \
 because the Grandmother’s gloominess was the contagious kind, infecting every member of \
 the household as fiercely as the bubonic plague. \
    Because Baby [Inocencio’s brother] and Ninfa’s apartment had room to accommodate \
 a guest, it was understood the Grandmother would stay with them until she could find a \
 (line 10) house of her own. This had seemed all well and fine when the plans were made long-\
 distance with Uncle Baby shouting into the receiver that he insisted, that he and Ninfa \
 wouldn’t think of her staying anywhere else, that the girls were thrilled she was coming. But \
 now that she was actually sleeping in [granddaughter] Amor’s narrow bed with radios and \
 televisions chattering throughout the apartment, and doors and cupboards banging, and the \
 (line 15) stink of cigarettes soaking into everything, even her skin, and trucks rumbling past and \
 shaking the building like an earthquake, and sirens and car horns at all hours, well, it just \
 about drove her crazy; even the rowdy Chicago wind, a rough, moody brute who took one \
 look at you and laughed. …\
    All day and all night the expressway traffic whooshed past, keeping the Grandmother\
 (line 20) awake. She napped when she could, even when the apartment and its inhabitants jabbered \
 the loudest. She was tired all the time, and yet she had trouble sleeping, often waking once \
 or twice in the early morning, and in her sleeplessness, padding in her house slippers to the \
 living room, where the front windows looked out onto the lanes of traffic, the expressway \
 billboards, and the frighteningly grimy factories beyond. The trucks and cars, furious to get\
 (line 25) from here to there, never paused for a moment, the sound of the expressway almost not a \
 sound at all, but a roar like the voice of the sea trapped inside a shell. \
    She pressed her forehead against the cold glass and sighed. If the Grandmother had \
 consulted her feelings, she would’ve understood why it was taking her so long to buy a new \
 house and settle in Chicago, but she was not a woman given to reflection. She missed her\
 (line 30) old house too much and was too proud to admit she’d made a mistake. She couldn’t go \
 backward, could she? She was stuck, in the middle of nowhere it seemed, halfway between \
 here and where? \
    The Grandmother missed the routine of her mornings, her three-minute eggs and \
 bolillo (bolillo - crunchy roll) breakfasts. She missed rubbing her big toe along the octagon tiles of her bathroom \
 (line 35) floor. But most of all, she missed her own bed with its mattress sagging in the center, the \
 familiar scent and weight of her blankets, the way morning entered gradually from the left\
 as the sun climbed over the east courtyard wall, the one topped with a cockscomb (cockscomb -rooster’s crown with jagged edges) of glass \
 shards to keep out the thieves. Why do we get so used to waking up in a certain room? And \
 when we aren’t in our own bed and wake up in another, a terrible fear for a moment, like\
 (line 40) death.\
    There is nothing worse than being a houseguest for too long, especially when your host\
 is a relative. The Grandmother felt like a prisoner. She hated climbing up the three flights\
 of stairs, and always arrived clutching her heart, convinced she was having an attack, like\
 the one that killed Narciso [her husband]. Really, once she was upstairs, she couldn’t even\
 (line 45) bear the thought of coming back down. What a barbarity! …\
    To visit Chicago is one thing, to live there another. This was not the Chicago of her\
 vacations, where one is always escorted to the lake shore, to the gold coast, driven along the\
 winding lanes of traffic of Lake Shore Drive in the shadow of beautiful apartment buildings,\
 along State Street and Michigan Avenue to window-shop at least. And perhaps taken on an\
 (line 50) excursion on the lake. How is it she hadn’t noticed the expression of the citizens, not the\
 ones fluttering in and out of taxis, but the ones at bus stops, hopping like sparrows, shivering\
 and peering anxiously for the next bus, and those descending wearily into the filthy bowels\
 of the subway like the souls condemned to purgatory.(purgatory - place of suffering)\
    At first the Grandmother was thrilled by the restaurants and the big discount chains—\
 (line 55) but then the routine got to be too familiar. Saturdays in search of houses that were not to\
 her liking. Dark brick houses with small, squinty windows, gloomy apartments, or damp\
 little bungalows, everything somber and sad and not letting in enough light, and no\
 courtyards, a dank, (dank - damp) mean gangway, a small patch of thin grass called a garden, and maybe a\
 bald tree in front. This wasn’t what she had in mind.\
 (line 60)   And as the weeks and months passed, and she was still without a house, the rainy, cold\
 autumn weather began and only made her feel worse. There was the Chicago winter\
 coming that everyone had warned her about, and she was already so cold and miserable she\
 didn’t feel much like leaving her room, let alone the building. She blamed Ninfa, who kept\
 lowering the heat in order to save money. The Grandmother confined herself to bed,\
 (line 65) satisfied only when she was under several layers of blankets. …\
    But nothing, nothing in the Grandmother’s imagination prepared her for the horrors of\
 a Chicago winter. It was not the picturesque (picturesque - charming) season of Christmas, but the endless tundra\
 of January, February, and March. Daylight dimmed to a dull pewter. (pewter - gray) The sun a thick piece\
 of ice behind a dirty woolen sky. It was a cold like you can’t imagine, a barbarous thing, a\
 (line 70) knife in the bone, a cold so cold it burned the lungs if one could even believe such a cold.\
 And the mountains of filthy snow shoveled in huge heaps, the chunks of ice on the sidewalk\
 that could kill an aged citizen. —Oh, this is nothing, you should’ve been here for the Big\
 Snow, the grandchildren bragged, speaking of the recent storm of ’68.\
    Big snow or little snow, it was all the same after the novelty of snow had worn off. A\
 (line 75) nuisance, a deadly thing, an exaggerated, long, drawn-out ordeal that made one feel like\
 dying, that killed one slowly, a torture. Let me die in February, let me die rather than have\
 to step out the door again, please, the Grandmother thought to herself, dreading having to\
 dress like a monster to go outside. —Ay, ya no puedo. I can’t anymore, I can’t. And just\
 when she could no longer, when she could no longer find the strength, the drive, the will to\
 (line 80) keep on living, when she was ready to fold into herself and let her spirit die, just then, and\
 only then, did April arrive with sky the color of hope and branches filled with possibilities.\

Reading Comprehension Passage A\
 \
 The factory made the best centrifugal pumps in the world, and Merle Waggoner owned\
 it. He’d started it. He’d just been offered two million dollars for it by the General Forge and\
 Foundry Company. He didn’t have any stockholders and he didn’t owe a dime. He was\
 fifty-one, a widower, and he had one heir—a son. The boy’s name was Franklin. The boy\
 (line 5) was named after Benjamin Franklin.\
 \
 One Friday afternoon father and son came out of Merle’s office and into the factory.\
 They went down a factory aisle to Rudy Linberg’s lathe. (lathe — a machine on which a piece of material, such as wood or metal, is spun and shaped against a fixed\
 cutting tool)\
 \
 “Rudy,” said Merle, “the boy here’s home from college for three days, and I thought\
 maybe you and him and your boy and me might go out to the farm and shoot some clay\
 (line 10) pigeons tomorrow.”\
 \
 Rudy turned his sky-blue eyes to Merle and young Franklin. He was Merle’s age, and\
 he had the deep and narrow dignity of a man who had learned his limitations early—who\
 had never tried to go beyond them. His limitations were those of his tools, his flute and his\
 shotgun. …\
 \
 (line 15) “Let’s go ask my boy what he’s got on tomorrow,” said Rudy. It was a formality. Karl\
 always did what his father wanted him to do—did it with profound love. …\
 \
 Karl was a carbon copy of his father. He was such a good mimic of Rudy that his joints\
 seemed to ache a little with age. He seemed sobered by fifty-one years of life, though he’d\
 lived only twenty. He seemed instinctively wary of safety hazards that had been eliminated\
 (line 20) from the factory by the time he’d learned to walk. Karl stood at attention without humility,\
 just as his father had done.\
 \
 “Want to go shooting tomorrow?” said Rudy.\
 “Shoot what?” said Karl.\
 “Crows. Clay pigeons,” said Rudy. “Maybe a woodchuck.”\
 \
 (line 25)“Don’t mind,” said Karl. He nodded briefly to Merle and Franklin. “Glad to.” …\
 Rudy nodded. He examined the work in Karl’s lathe and tapped his own temple. The\
 tapping was a signal that Franklin had seen many times on hunts. It meant that Karl was\
 doing fine.\
 \
 Rudy touched Karl’s elbow lightly. It was the signal for Karl to get back to work. Rudy\
 (line 30) and Karl each held up a crooked finger and saluted with it. Franklin knew what that meant\
 too. It meant, “Good-by, I love you.” …\
 \
 Merle was sitting at his desk, his head down, when Franklin came in. He held a steel\
 plate about six inches square in his left hand. In the middle of the plate was a hole two inches\
 square. In his right hand he held a steel cube that fitted the hole exactly. …\
 \
 (line 35) Franklin sat down gingerly on a hard chair by the wall. The office hadn’t changed much\
 in the years he’d known it. It was one more factory room, with naked pipes overhead—the\
 cold ones sweaty, the hot ones dry. Wires snaked from steel box to steel box. The green walls\
 and cream trim were as rough as elephant hide in some places, with alternating coats of\
 paint and grime, paint and grime.\
 \
 (line 40) There had never been time to scrape away the layers, and barely enough time,\
 overnight, to slap on new paint. And there had never been time in which to finish the rough\
 shelves that lined the room. …\
 \
 Merle slipped the cube through the square hole once more. “Know what these are?” he\
 said.\
 \
 (line 45) “Yes, sir,” said Franklin. “They’re what Rudy Linberg had to make when he was an\
 apprentice in Sweden.”\
 The cube could be slipped through the hole in twenty-four different ways, without\
 letting the tiniest ray of light pass through with it.\
 \
 “Unbelievable skill,” said Franklin respectfully. “There aren’t craftsmen like that\
 (line 50) coming along any more.” He didn’t really feel much respect. He was simply saying what he\
 knew his father wanted to hear. The cube and the hole struck him as criminal wastes of time\
 and great bores. “Unbelievable,” he said again.\
 \
 “It’s utterly unbelievable, when you realize that Rudy didn’t make them,” said Merle\
 gravely, “when you realize what generation the man who made them belongs to.”\
 \
 (line 55) “Oh?” said Franklin. “Who did make them?”\
 \
 “Rudy’s boy, Karl,” said Merle. “A member of your generation.” He ground out his cigar\
 sadly. “He gave them to me on my last birthday. They were on my desk, boy, waiting for me\
 when I came in—right beside the ones Rudy gave me thirty-one years before.” …\
 \
 “I could have cried, boy, when I saw those two plates and those two cubes side by side,”\
 (line 60) said Merle. “Can you understand that?” he asked beseechingly. “Can you understand why\
 I’d feel like crying?” …\
 \
 “The cube of Karl’s fitted through the hole of Rudy’s!” said Merle. “They were\
 interchangeable!”\
 \
 “Gosh!” said Franklin. “I’ll be darned. Really?”\
 \
 (line 65) And now he felt like crying, because he didn’t care, couldn’t care—and would have\
 given his right arm to care. The factory whanged and banged and screeched in monstrous\
 irrelevance—Franklin’s, all Franklin’s, if he just said the word.\
 \
 “What’ll you do with it—buy a theater in New York?” said Merle abruptly.\
 \
 “Do with what, sir?” said Franklin.\
 \
 (line 70) “The money I’ll get for the factory when I sell it—the money I’ll leave to you when I’m\
 dead,” said Merle. He hit the word “dead” hard. “What’s Waggoner Pump going to be\
 converted into? Waggoner Theaters? Waggoner School of Acting? The Waggoner Home for\
 Broken-Down Actors?”\
 \
 “I—I hadn’t thought about it,” said Franklin. The idea of converting Waggoner Pump\
 (line 75) into something equally complicated hadn’t occurred to him, and appalled him now. He was\
 being asked to match his father’s passion for the factory with an equal passion for something\
 else. And Franklin had no such passion—for the theater or anything else. …\
 \
 “Don’t sell on my account,” said Franklin wretchedly.\
 \
 “On whose account would I keep it?” said Merle.\
 \
 (line 80) “Do you have to sell it today?” said Franklin, horrified.\
 \
 “Strike while the iron’s hot, I always say,” said Merle. “Today’s the day you decided to\
 be an actor, and, as luck would have it, we have an excellent offer for what I did with my\
 life.”\
 \
 “Couldn’t we wait?”\
 \
 (line 85) “For what?” said Merle. He was having a good time now.\
 \
 “Father!” cried Franklin. “For the love of heaven, father, please!” He hung his head and\
 shook it. “I don’t know what I’m doing,” he said brokenly. “I don’t know for sure what I want\
 to do yet. I’m just playing with ideas, trying to find myself. Please, father, don’t sell what\
 you’ve done with your life, don’t just throw it away because I’m not sure I want to do that\
 (line 90) with my life too! Please!” Franklin looked up. “I’m not Karl Linberg,” he said. “I can’t help\
 it. I’m sorry, but I’m not Karl Linberg.” …\

 Excerpt from a letter by Chinese Commissioner Lin Zexu to Queen Victoria August 27, 1839\
 \
 . . . Your country is more than 60,000 li [18,641 miles] from China. The purpose of your ships in coming to China is to realize a large profit. Since this profit is realized in China and is in fact taken away from the Chinese people, how can foreigners return injury for the benefit they have received by sending this poison to harm their benefactors? They may not intend to harm others on purpose, but the fact remains that they are so obsessed with material gain that they have no concern whatever for the harm they can cause to others. Have they no conscience? I have heard that you strictly prohibit opium in your own country, indicating unmistakably that you know how harmful opium is. You do not wish opium to harm your own country, but you choose to bring that harm to other countries such as China. Why?. . .\

Excerpt from A la Carte\
 \
 by Tanita S. Davis\
 \
 (paragraph 1) “Homework?” My mother mouths the word exaggeratedly, eyebrows raised, and I roll my eyes. Frowning, she points with her chin to the side door that leads to the stairs. I roll my eyes again, mouthing, Okay, okay, not needing her to pantomime further what she wants me to do. I hate the thought of leaving the clattering nerve center of the restaurant to wrestle with my trigonometry homework in my mother’s quiet office downstairs.\
 \
 (paragraph 2) “Order!”\
 \
 (paragraph 3) The bright lights and swirl of noise and motion are muffled as the kitchen door swings closed behind me.\
 \
 (paragraph 4) It’s hard to remember a time when the restaurant hasn’t been the center of our lives. Mom used to be a copy editor and wrote food features for our local paper, the Clarion, and she met Pia when she did a write-up on the culinary school Pia attended. Pia thinks it was fate that Mom wanted to invest in a restaurant at the same time Pia wanted to buy the old bank building.\
 \
 (paragraph 5) La Salle Rouge doesn’t serve much in the way of “kid” food, since the menu doesn’t cater to people my age on a cheap date, but I’ve loved everything about it from the first. I started experimenting with being a vegetarian when I turned fourteen, but Pia still found things to feed me and taught me to be creative with vegetables and tofu. I like to think I’m the best-fed vegetarian in the state of California.\
 \
 (paragraph 6) Pia’s been really good about teaching what she knows, and I decided early on that this is the work I want to do—get out of school and get into the kitchen for good. Mom and Pia have created a popular French-Asian-Californian fusion restaurant that has gotten great reviews from food critics. They took the best of each other’s tastes—Mom’s traditional Southern flavors and Pia’s French training combined with her vegetable- and spice-savvy Cambodian tastes—and pulled off what one food critic called “stylized food with unique flavor combinations in an intimate setting.”\
 \
 (paragraph 7) Whatever that means.\
 \
 (paragraph 8) Three years ago, when I started high school thirty pounds heavier than everyone in my class, Mom and I came up with a light menu for La Salle Rouge, and it’s been such a popular idea that Mom lets me come up with tasty, low-calorie desserts, which is one of my favorite things to do. It hardly seems fair that I have to walk away from all of that just to do trigonometry, but my mom says I have to finish school before I concentrate on cooking. She says it’s smarter to have a “backup plan,” and she’s made me apply to plenty of colleges and check out business majors just in case I ever want to do anything else with my life. I guess that makes sense if you’re anybody other than me. When I turn eighteen, I already know what I’m going to do.\
 \
 (paragraph 9) First, I’m going to buy a plane ticket to D.C. and go to Julia Child’s kitchen at the Smithsonian and leave roses. They don’t let you walk through it, but somewhere—I don’t know where—I’m going to leave a bouquet and a little note for her. Julia Child is my patron saint. (patron saint - an inspiring person admired for his or her work) She’s the queen of all reasons people can do anything they want in life. Saint Julia didn’t start cooking until she was practically forty, and she went on to do TV shows and make cookbooks and be this huge part of culinary history. She never got too fancy, she never freaked out, and she was never afraid to try new things. I want to be just like her—except maybe get famous faster.\
 \
 (paragraph 10) The second thing I’m going to do is buy myself a set of knives. Pia swears by this set of German steel knives she got when she graduated, but I’ve seen the TV chef Kylie Kwong use a phenomenal-looking ceramic knife on her show on the Discovery Channel. Either way, knives are what the best chefs have of their very own.\
 \
 (paragraph 11) The third thing I’m going to do, after I get back from Washington and get my knives, is . . . get discovered. Somehow. I know I’m going to have to pay my dues, but I’m so ready for my real life to start. It’s not something I admit to a lot, but my real dream is to be a celebrity chef. Do you know how many African American female chefs there aren’t? And how many vegetarian chefs have their own shows? The field is wide open for stardom. Every time I watch old episodes of Saint Julia, I imagine that I have my own cooking show. The way celebrity chefs do it now, I could also have a line of cooking gear, cookbooks, aprons, the works. People would know my name, ask for my autograph, and try my recipes. All I have to do is finish my trig homework and get back into the kitchen.\
In paragraph 11, what does the one-word statement “Somehow” reveal?\
(A) It illustrates the narrator’s enthusiasm about her future plans.\
 (B) It shows the narrator has some questions about whether she will succeed or not.\
 (C) It shows the narrator does not have every detail of her future plans figured out just yet.\
 (D) It demonstrates the narrator’s lack of knowledge about how difficult her goals are to achieve.\

 Excerpt from The Guest Cat\
 \
 by Takashi Hiraide\
 \
 (paragraph 1) The cat’s name was Chibi, which means “little one.” We could hear the boy’s particularly high-pitched voice calling the cat: “Chibi!” Then we’d hear the sound of the boy’s shoes running around outside, followed by the tinkling of the little bell announcing the cat’s arrival.\
 \
 (paragraph 2) Chibi was a jewel of a cat. Her pure white fur was mottled with several lampblack blotches containing just a bit of light brown. The sort of cat you might see just about anywhere in Japan, except she was especially slim and tiny.\
 \
 (paragraph 3) These were her individual characteristics—slim and small, with ears that stood out, tapering off beautifully at the tips, and often twitching. She would approach silently and undetected to rub up against one’s legs. At first I thought Chibi avoided me because I was not used to cats, but this seems not to have been the case. When a girl who often passed along Lightning Alley stopped and crouched to gaze at the cat, it did not run away. But as soon as she attempted to touch it, the cat quickly slipped off, avoiding contact at all costs. The cat’s manner of rejection was like cold, white light.\
 \
 (paragraph 4) Moreover, the cat rarely made a sound. As far as I remember, when it first appeared in the alley it made some sort of sound, but since then it had never let out a meow. It looked as if no matter how much time passed the cat was not going to let us hear its\
 voice. This seemed to be the message the cat was giving us.\
 \
 (paragraph 5) Another one of Chibi’s characteristics was that she changed the direction of her cautious attention frequently. This active behavior wasn’t limited to her kittenhood. Perhaps because she played alone most of the time in the expansive garden, she reacted strongly to insects and reptiles. And there were times when I could only conclude that she must be reacting to subtle changes in the wind and light, not detectable by humans. It may be that most cats share the same quickness, but even so, in Chibi’s case, it was acute—she was, after all, the cat of Lightning Alley. My wife got into the habit of pointing to the cat whenever it went by, extolling (extolling - praising) its virtues. . . .\
 \
 (paragraph 6) Chibi, who loved to play ball, gradually began to visit us on her own and would try and get us to play with her. She would step gingerly into the room and gaze intently at its occupants, then purposefully turn around and walk back out, as if to lead us to the garden. This process would be repeated until she got a response. Most of the time my wife would put down whatever she was doing, slip happily into her sandals and head outside.\
 \
 (paragraph 7) Having played to her heart’s content, Chibi would come inside and rest for a while. When she began to sleep on the sofa—like a talisman (talisman - an object thought to bring good luck) curled gently in the shape of a comma and dug up from a prehistoric archaeological site—a deep sense of happiness arrived, as if the house itself had dreamed this scene.\
 \
 (paragraph 8) Avoiding the prying eyes of the landlady, we began leaving it up to Chibi to come inside the house whenever she wanted—and with this new development I had begun little by little to understand cat lovers. Whether on TV or in all of the ubiquitous (ubiquitous - present everywhere) cat calendars, it seemed as if there was no cat comparable to her. But, though I had started to think of her as the best cat around, she was not really our cat.\
 \
 (paragraph 9) First we would hear the tinkling of the bell, and then she would appear, so we began to call her by the nickname “Tinkerbell.” Whenever we wanted her to come over, this name seemed to find itself on our lips.\
 \
 (paragraph 10) “I wonder where Tinkerbell is.” By the time my wife had gotten the words out of her mouth we’d hear the tinkling of Chibi’s bell. We’d realize that she was near at the point where, exiting the foyer next door (located at the second corner of Lightning Alley), Chibi would leap through the tear in the wire-mesh boundary of the property, dash along the side of the building, turn at the far end of the veranda, leap up onto the open area of the deck, and then, placing her front paws on the window frame at about the height of a human adult’s knee, stretch out her neck to peek inside.\
 \
 (paragraph 11) In winter she came inside. Little by little, through the crack in the partially opened window, her tendency to visit subtly developed; her appearances were repeated until, as if a silken opening in a fabric had been continuously moistened and stretched, Chibi had entered our lives. But at the same time—call it fate if you will—something else was closing in and pressing itself against that tendency.\
Which quotation best expresses a central idea of the story?\
(A) “The cat’s name was Chibi, which means ‘little one.’ ” (paragraph 1)\
 (B) “The cat’s manner of rejection was like cold, white light.” (paragraph 3)\
 (C) “Having played to her heart’s content, Chibi would come inside and rest for a while.” (paragraph 7)\
 (D) “But, though I had started to think of her as the best cat around, she was not really our cat.” (paragraph 8)\

Potatoes were the main crop in Ireland in the 1800s. Almost the entire population of Ireland was dependent on a single variety of potato, the “lumper.” These potatoes were reproduced by a method of asexual reproduction known as vegetative propagation. In the middle of the 1800s, a disease caused by a fungus killed almost the entire lumper crop within two years. As a result, millions of people in Ireland died of starvation. The most likely reason the potato disease was able to destroy the potato crop in such a short time is that the\
(1) potato population lacked variations\
 (2) lumper variety had a long reproductive cycle\
 (3) lumper had several variations caused by vegetative propagation\
 (4) potato population in Ireland utilized all of the finite resources\

Tracking the Big Horn\
 \
 Bighorn sheep, Ovis canadensis, are a majestic symbol of the mountainous West. They browse at high altitudes and in steep, rocky areas from Texas to British Columbia. Rams’ horns curl around their eyes and grow up to 45 inches long. Males butt horns to establish dominance during the fall rut [mating season]. Ewes [females] sport shorter, spiked horns similar to a mountain goat’s. From their first days of life, bighorns are surefooted enough to scale cliffs too steep for most predators to follow.…\
 \
 Two centuries ago, an estimated 1.5 million to 2 million bighorn sheep lived in North America; today, a mere 28,000 remain. Diseases caught from domestic sheep, competition from livestock for forage, and trophy hunting for their horns caused populations to plummet [drop rapidly]. Bighorns graze in mountain meadows, habitat that is being lost to expanding forests, which are growing beyond their historic boundaries in part because the wildfires that are used to hold them in check have been suppressed. Glacier National Park, home to 400 to 600 bighorn sheep, lists the animals as a “species of concern,” that is, at risk\
 of becoming endangered.…\

    Sixty per cent of Hiroshima was obliterated [destroyed] by the lone atomic bomb dropped on Sunday, it was announced in Guam last night. Five major industrial plants disappeared and additional damage was done beyond the wiped-out area. Only 2.8 square miles of the city’s 6.9 square miles remained.\
    The city disappeared in a cloud of smoke, flame and dust that rose 40,000 feet. The missile struck the center of the target, a flash brighter than sunlight covered the city and several minutes later the smoke cloud reached up to the stratosphere. . . .\

Excerpt from “The Beadwork” from American Indian Stories\
 \
 by Zitkala-Sa\
 \
 (paragraph 1) Soon after breakfast mother sometimes began her beadwork. On a bright, clear day, she pulled out the wooden pegs that pinned the skirt of our wigwam to the ground, and rolled the canvas part way up on its frame of slender poles. Then the cool morning breezes swept freely through our dwelling, now and then wafting the perfume of sweet grasses from the newly burnt prairie.\
 \
 (paragraph 2) Untying the long tasseled strings that bound a small brown buckskin bag, my mother spread upon a mat beside her bunches of colored beads, just as an artist arranges the paints upon his palette. On a lapboard she smoothed out a double sheet of soft white buckskin; and drawing from a beaded case that hung on the left of her wide\
 belt a long, narrow blade, she trimmed the buckskin into shape. Often she worked upon small moccasins for her small daughter. Then I became intensely interested in her designing. With a proud, beaming face, I watched her work. In imagination, I saw myself walking in a new pair of snugly fitting moccasins. I felt the envious eyes of my playmates upon the pretty red beads decorating my feet.\
 \
 (paragraph 3) Close beside my mother I sat on a rug, with a scrap of buckskin in one hand and an awl in the other. This was the beginning of my practical observation lessons in the art of beadwork. From a skein of finely twisted threads of silvery sinews my mother pulled out a single one. With an awl she pierced the buckskin, and skillfully threaded it with the white sinew. Picking up the tiny beads one by one, she strung them with the point of her thread, always twisting it carefully after every stitch. . . .\
 \
 (paragraph 4) Always after these confining lessons I was wild with surplus spirits, and found joyous relief in running loose in the open again. Many a summer afternoon a party of four or five of my playmates roamed over the hills with me. We each carried a light, sharpened rod about four feet long, with which we pried up certain sweet roots. When we had eaten all the choice roots we chanced upon, we shouldered our rods and strayed off into patches of a stalky plant under whose yellow blossoms we found little crystal drops of gum. Drop by drop we gathered this nature’s rock-candy, until each of us could boast of a lump the size of a small bird’s egg. Soon satiated (satiated - completely satisfied) with its woody flavor, we tossed away our gum, to return again to the sweet roots.\
 \
 (paragraph 5) I remember well how we used to exchange our necklaces, beaded belts, and sometimes even our moccasins. We pretended to offer them as gifts to one another. We delighted in impersonating our own mothers. We talked of things we had heard them say in their conversations. We imitated their various manners, even to the inflection of their voices. In the lap of the prairie we seated ourselves upon our feet, and leaning our painted cheeks in the palms of our hands, we rested our elbows on our knees, and bent forward as old women were most accustomed to do.\
 \
 (paragraph 6) While one was telling of some heroic deed recently done by a near relative, the rest of us listened attentively, and exclaimed in undertones “Han! han!” (yes! yes!) whenever the speaker paused for breath, or sometimes for our sympathy. As the discourse became more thrilling, according to our ideas, we raised our voices in these interjections. In these impersonations our parents were led to say only those things that were in common favor.\
 \
 (paragraph 7) No matter how exciting a tale we might be rehearsing, the mere shifting of a cloud shadow in the landscape near by was sufficient to change our impulses; and soon we were all chasing the great shadows that played among the hills. We shouted and whooped in the chase; laughing and calling to one another, we were like little sportive nymphs (sportive nymphs - playful creatures of the woods) on that Dakota sea of rolling green.\
 \
 (paragraph 8) On one occasion I forgot the cloud shadow in a strange notion to catch up with my own shadow. Standing straight and still, I began to glide after it, putting out one foot cautiously. When, with the greatest care, I set my foot in advance of myself, my shadow crept onward too. Then again I tried it; this time with the other foot. Still again my shadow escaped me. I began to run; and away flew my shadow, always just a step beyond me. Faster and faster I ran, setting my teeth and clenching my fists, determined to overtake my own fleet shadow. But ever swifter it glided before me while I was growing breathless and hot. Slackening my speed, I was greatly vexed that my shadow should check its pace also. Daring it to the utmost, as I thought, I sat down upon a rock imbedded in the hillside.\
 \
 (paragraph 9) So! my shadow had the impudence (impudence - nerve) to sit down beside me!\
 \
 (paragraph 10) Now my comrades caught up with me, and began to ask why I was running away so fast.\
 \
 (paragraph 11) “Oh, I was chasing my shadow! Didn’t you ever do that?” I inquired, surprised that they should not understand.\
 \
 (paragraph 12) They planted their moccasined feet firmly upon my shadow to stay it, and I arose. Again my shadow slipped away, and moved as often as I did. Then we gave up trying to catch my shadow.\
 \
 (paragraph 13) Before this peculiar experience, I have no distinct memory of having recognized any vital bond between myself and my shadow. I never gave it an afterthought.\
 \
 (paragraph 14) Returning to our borrowed belts and trinkets, we rambled homeward. That evening, as on other evenings, I went to sleep over my legends.\

Reading Comprehension Passage A\
 \
 …It was so cold that his first breath turned to iron in his throat, the hairs in his nostrils\
 webbed into instant ice, his eyes stung and watered. In the faint starlight and the bluish\
 luminescence of the snow everything beyond a few yards away swam deceptive and without\
 depth, glimmering with things half seen or imagined. Beside the dead car he stood with his\
 (line 5) head bent, listening, and there was not a sound. Everything on the planet might have died\
 in the cold. …\
 \
 But here he stood in light overcoat and thin leather gloves, without overshoes, and his\
 car all but blocked the road, and the door could not be locked, and there was not a\
 possibility that he could carry the heavy cases with him to the next farm or village. He\
 (line 10) switched on the headlights again and studied the roadside they revealed, and saw a rail\
 fence, with cedars and spruces behind it. When more complex gadgets and more complex\
 cures failed, there was always the lucifer match (lucifer match — a match that ignites through friction).\
 \
 Ten minutes later he was sitting with the auto robe over his head and shoulders and his\
 back against the plowed snowbank, digging the half melted snow from inside his shoes and\
 (line 15) gloating over the growing light and warmth of the fire. He had a supply of fence rails good\
 for an hour. In that time, someone would come along and he could get a push or a tow. In\
 this country, in winter, no one ever passed up a stranded motorist. …\
 \
 Abruptly he did not want to wait in that lonely snow-banked ditch any longer. The\
 sample cases (sample cases — cases of medicine samples) could look after themselves, any motorist who passed could take his own\
 (line 20) chances. He would walk ahead to the nearest help, and if he found himself getting too cold\
 on the way, he could always build another fire. The thought of action cheered him; he\
 admitted to himself that he was all but terrified at the silence and the iron cold. …\
 \
 Turning with the road, he passed through the stretch of woods and came into the open\
 to see the moon-white, shadow-black buildings of a farm, and the weak bloom of light in a\
 (line 25) window. …\
 \
 “Hello?” he said, and knocked again. “Anybody home?” No sound answered him. He\
 saw the moon glint on the great icicles along the eaves. His numb hand ached with the pain\
 of knocking; he pounded with the soft edge of his fist.\
 \
 Answer finally came, not from the door before which he stood, but from the barn, down\
 (line 30) at the end of a staggered string of attached sheds. A door creaked open against a snowbank\
 and a figure with a lantern appeared, stood for a moment, and came running. The traveler\
 wondered at the way it came, lurching and stumbling in the uneven snow, until it arrived at\
 the porch and he saw that it was a boy of eleven or twelve. The boy set his lantern on the\
 porch; between the upturned collar of his mackinaw (mackinaw — type of warm coat) and the down-pulled stocking cap his\
 (line 35) face was a pinched whiteness, his eyes enormous. He stared at the traveler until the traveler\
 became aware of the blanket he still held over head and shoulders, and began to laugh.\
 \
 “My car stopped on me, a mile or so up the road,” he said. “I was just hunting a\
 telephone or some place where I could get help.”\
 \
 The boy swallowed, wiped the back of his mitt across his nose. “Grandpa’s sick!” he\
 (line 40) blurted, and opened the door. …\
 \
 “He must’ve had a shock,” the boy said. “I came in from chores and he was on the floor.”\
 He stared at the mummy under the quilt, and he swallowed. …\
 \
 “Why didn’t you go for help?”\
 \
 The boy looked down, ashamed. “It’s near two miles. I was afraid he’d.…”\
 \
 (line 45) “But you left him. You were out in the barn.”\
 \
 “I was hitching up to go,” the boy said. “I’d made up my mind.”\
 \
 The traveler backed away from the stove, his face smarting (smarting — stinging) with the heat, his fingers\
 and feet beginning to ache. He looked at the old man and knew that here, as at the car, he\
 was helpless. The boy’s thin anxious face told him how thoroughly his own emergency had\
 (line 50) been swallowed up in this other one. He had been altered from a man in need of help to\
 one who must give it. Salesman of wonder cures, he must now produce something to calm\
 this over-worried boy, restore a dying man. Rebelliously, victimized by circumstances, he\
 said, “Where were you going for help?”\
 \
 “The Hill place. They’ve got a phone.”\
 \
 (line 55) “How far are they from a town?”\
 \
 “About five miles.”\
 \
 “Doctor there?”\
 \
 “Yes.”\
 \
 “If I took your horse and—what is it, sleigh?—could someone at the Hills’ bring them\
 (line 60) back, do you think?”\
 \
 “Cutter (cutter — a small horse-drawn sled). One of the Hill boys could, I should say.”\
 \
 “Or would you rather go, while I look after your Grandpa?”\
 \
 “He don’t know you,” the boy said directly. “If he should wake up he might … wonder\
 … it might.…”\
 \
 (line 65) The traveler grudgingly gave up the prospect of staying in the warm kitchen while the\
 boy did the work. And he granted that it was extraordinarily sensitive of the boy to know\
 how it might disturb a man to wake from sickness in his own house and stare into the face\
 of an utter stranger. “Yes,” he said. “Well, I could call the doctor from the Hills’. Two miles,\
 did you say?” …\
 \
 (line 70) He climbed into the cutter and pulled over his lap the balding buffalo robe he found\
 there; the scallop (scallop — curve) of its felt edges was like a key that fitted a door. The horses breathed jets\
 of steam in the moonlight, restlessly moving, jingling their harness bells, as the moment\
 lengthened itself. The traveler saw how the boy, now that his anxiety was somewhat quieted,\
 now that he had been able to unload part of his burden, watched him with a thousand\
 (line 75) questions in his face, and he remembered how he himself, thirty years ago, had searched\
 the faces of passing strangers for something he could not name, how he had listened to their\
 steps and seen their shadows lengthen ahead of them down roads that led to unimaginable\
 places, and how he had ached with the desire to know them, who they were. But none of\
 them had looked back at him as he tried now to look at this boy. …\
 \
 (line 80) For half a breath he was utterly bewitched, frozen at the heart of some icy dream.\
 Abruptly he slapped the reins across the backs of the horses; the cutter jerked and then slid\
 smoothly out toward the road. The traveler looked back once, to fix forever the picture of\
 himself standing silently watching himself go. As he slid into the road the horses broke into\
 a trot. The icy flow of air locked his throat and made him let go the reins with one hand to\
 (line 85) pull the hairy, wool-smelling edge of the blanket all but shut across his face.\
 \
 Along a road he had never driven he went swiftly toward an unknown farm and an\
 unknown town, to distribute according to some wise law part of the burden of the boy’s\
 emergency and his own; but he bore (bore — carried) in his mind, bright as moonlight over snow, a vivid\
 wonder, almost an awe. For from that most chronic and incurable of ills, identity, he had\
 (line 90) looked outward and for one unmistakable instant recognized himself.\

 Excerpt from Snowflake Bentley\
 by Jacqueline Briggs Martin\
 \
 (paragraph 1) In the days when farmers worked with ox and sled and cut the dark with lantern light, there lived a boy who loved snow more than anything in the world. Willie Bentley’s happiest days were snowstorm days. He watched snowflakes on his mittens, on the dried grass of Vermont farm fields, on the dark metal handle of the barn door. He said snow was as beautiful as butterflies, or apple blossoms.\
 \
 (paragraph 2) He could net butterflies and show them to his older brother, Charlie. He could pick apple blossoms and take them to his mother. But he could not share snowflakes because he could not save them.\
 \
 (paragraph 3) When his mother gave him an old microscope, he used it to look at flowers, raindrops, and blades of grass. Best of all, he used it to look at snow. While other children built forts and pelted snowballs at roosting crows, Willie was catching snowflakes. Day after stormy day he studied the icy crystals.\
 \
 (paragraph 4) Their intricate patterns were even more beautiful than he had imagined. He expected to find whole flakes that were the same, that were copies of each other. But he never did. Willie decided he must find a way to save snowflakes so others could see their wonderful designs. For three winters he tried drawing snow crystals. They always melted before he could finish.\
 \
 (paragraph 5) When he was sixteen, Willie read of a camera with its own microscope. “If I had that camera I could photograph snowflakes,” he told his mother. Willie’s mother knew that he would not be happy until he could share what he had seen.\
 \
 (paragraph6) “Fussing with snow is just foolishness,” his father said. Still, he loved his son. When Willie was seventeen his parents spent their savings and bought the camera. It was taller than a newborn calf, and cost as much as his father’s herd of ten cows. Willie was sure it was the best of all cameras.\
 \
 (paragraph 7) Even so his first pictures were failures—no better than shadows. Yet he would not quit. Mistake by mistake, snowflake by snowflake, Willie worked through every storm. Winter ended, the snow melted, and he had no good pictures. He waited for another season of snow. One day, in the second winter, he tried a new experiment. And it\
 worked! Willie had figured out how to photograph snowflakes! “Now everyone can see the great beauty in a tiny crystal,” he said.\
 \
 (paragraph 8) But in those days, no one cared. Neighbors laughed at the idea of photographing snow. “Snow in Vermont is as common as dirt,” they said. “We don’t need pictures.” Willie said the photographs would be his gift to the world. While other farmers sat by the fire or rode to town with horse and sleigh, Willie studied snowstorms. He stood at the shed door and held out a black tray to catch the flakes.\
 \
 (paragraph 9) When he found only jumbled, broken crystals, he brushed the tray clean with a turkey feather and held it out again. He waited hours for just the right crystal and didn’t notice the cold. If the shed were warm the snow would melt. If he breathed on the black tray the snow would melt. If he twitched a muscle as he held the snow crystal on the long wood pick the snowflake would break. He had to work fast or the snowflake would evaporate before he could slide it into place and take its picture. Some winters he was able to make only a few dozen good pictures. Some winters he made hundreds. . . .\
 \
 (paragraph 10) But his snow crystal pictures were always his favorites. He gave copies away or sold them for a few cents. He made special pictures as gifts for birthdays. He held evening slide shows on the lawns of his friends. Children and adults sat on the grass and watched while Willie projected his slides onto a sheet hung over a clothesline.\
 \
 (paragraph 11) He wrote about snow and published his pictures in magazines. He gave speeches about snow to faraway scholars and neighborhood skywatchers. “You are doing great work,” said a professor from Wisconsin. The little farmer came to be known as the world’s expert on snow, “the Snowflake Man.” But he never grew rich. He spent every\
 penny on his pictures. Willie said there were treasures in snow. “I can’t afford to miss a single snowstorm,” he told a friend. “I never know when I will find some wonderful prize.”\
Which quotation best supports a main idea of the article?\
(A) “He expected to find whole flakes that were the same . . .” (paragraph 4)\
 (B) “ ‘Fussing with snow is just foolishness,’ his father said.” (paragraph 6)\
 (C) “Even so his first pictures were failures . . .” (paragraph 7)\
 (D) “ ‘Now everyone can see the great beauty in a tiny crystal,’ he said.”\

 “My car stopped on me, a mile or so up the road,” he said. “I was just hunting a\
 telephone or some place where I could get help.”\
 \
 The boy swallowed, wiped the back of his mitt across his nose. “Grandpa’s sick!” he\
 (line 40) blurted, and opened the door. …\
 \
 “He must’ve had a shock,” the boy said. “I came in from chores and he was on the floor.”\
 He stared at the mummy under the quilt, and he swallowed. …\
 \
 “Why didn’t you go for help?”\
 \
 The boy looked down, ashamed. “It’s near two miles. I was afraid he’d.…”\
 \
 (line 45) “But you left him. You were out in the barn.”\
 \
 “I was hitching up to go,” the boy said. “I’d made up my mind.”\
 \
 The traveler backed away from the stove, his face smarting (smarting — stinging) with the heat, his fingers\
 and feet beginning to ache. He looked at the old man and knew that here, as at the car, he\
 was helpless. The boy’s thin anxious face told him how thoroughly his own emergency had\
 (line 50) been swallowed up in this other one. He had been altered from a man in need of help to\
 one who must give it. Salesman of wonder cures, he must now produce something to calm\
 this over-worried boy, restore a dying man. Rebelliously, victimized by circumstances, he\
 said, “Where were you going for help?”\
 \
 “The Hill place. They’ve got a phone.”\
 \
 (line 55) “How far are they from a town?”\
 \
 “About five miles.”\
 \
 “Doctor there?”\
 \
 “Yes.”\
 \
 “If I took your horse and—what is it, sleigh?—could someone at the Hills’ bring them\
 (line 60) back, do you think?”\
 \
 “Cutter (cutter — a small horse-drawn sled). One of the Hill boys could, I should say.”\
 \
 “Or would you rather go, while I look after your Grandpa?”\
 \
 “He don’t know you,” the boy said directly. “If he should wake up he might … wonder\
 … it might.…”\
 \
 (line 65) The traveler grudgingly gave up the prospect of staying in the warm kitchen while the\
 boy did the work. And he granted that it was extraordinarily sensitive of the boy to know\
 how it might disturb a man to wake from sickness in his own house and stare into the face\
 of an utter stranger. “Yes,” he said. “Well, I could call the doctor from the Hills’. Two miles,\
 did you say?” …\
 \
 (line 70) He climbed into the cutter and pulled over his lap the balding buffalo robe he found\
 there; the scallop (scallop — curve) of its felt edges was like a key that fitted a door. The horses breathed jets\
 of steam in the moonlight, restlessly moving, jingling their harness bells, as the moment\
 lengthened itself. The traveler saw how the boy, now that his anxiety was somewhat quieted,\
 now that he had been able to unload part of his burden, watched him with a thousand\
 (line 75) questions in his face, and he remembered how he himself, thirty years ago, had searched\
 the faces of passing strangers for something he could not name, how he had listened to their\
 steps and seen their shadows lengthen ahead of them down roads that led to unimaginable\
 places, and how he had ached with the desire to know them, who they were. But none of\
 them had looked back at him as he tried now to look at this boy. …\
 \
 (line 80) For half a breath he was utterly bewitched, frozen at the heart of some icy dream.\
 Abruptly he slapped the reins across the backs of the horses; the cutter jerked and then slid\
 smoothly out toward the road. The traveler looked back once, to fix forever the picture of\
 himself standing silently watching himself go. As he slid into the road the horses broke into\
 a trot. The icy flow of air locked his throat and made him let go the reins with one hand to\
 (line 85) pull the hairy, wool-smelling edge of the blanket all but shut across his face.\
 \
 Along a road he had never driven he went swiftly toward an unknown farm and an\
 unknown town, to distribute according to some wise law part of the burden of the boy’s\
 emergency and his own; but he bore (bore — carried) in his mind, bright as moonlight over snow, a vivid\
 wonder, almost an awe. For from that most chronic and incurable of ills, identity, he had\
 (line 90) looked outward and for one unmistakable instant recognized himself.\
 \

This story takes place in Japan. The narrator has just rented a new home on a small street named Lightning Alley.\
 \
 Excerpt from The Guest Cat\
 \
 by Takashi Hiraide\
 \
 (paragraph 1) The cat’s name was Chibi, which means “little one.” We could hear the boy’s particularly high-pitched voice calling the cat: “Chibi!” Then we’d hear the sound of the boy’s shoes running around outside, followed by the tinkling of the little bell announcing the cat’s arrival.\
 \
 (paragraph 2) Chibi was a jewel of a cat. Her pure white fur was mottled with several lampblack blotches containing just a bit of light brown. The sort of cat you might see just about anywhere in Japan, except she was especially slim and tiny.\
 \
 (paragraph 3) These were her individual characteristics—slim and small, with ears that stood out, tapering off beautifully at the tips, and often twitching. She would approach silently and undetected to rub up against one’s legs. At first I thought Chibi avoided me because I was not used to cats, but this seems not to have been the case. When a girl who often passed along Lightning Alley stopped and crouched to gaze at the cat, it did not run away. But as soon as she attempted to touch it, the cat quickly slipped off, avoiding contact at all costs. The cat’s manner of rejection was like cold, white light.\
 \
 (paragraph 4) Moreover, the cat rarely made a sound. As far as I remember, when it first appeared in the alley it made some sort of sound, but since then it had never let out a meow. It looked as if no matter how much time passed the cat was not going to let us hear its\
 voice. This seemed to be the message the cat was giving us.\
 \
 (paragraph 5) Another one of Chibi’s characteristics was that she changed the direction of her cautious attention frequently. This active behavior wasn’t limited to her kittenhood. Perhaps because she played alone most of the time in the expansive garden, she reacted strongly to insects and reptiles. And there were times when I could only conclude that she must be reacting to subtle changes in the wind and light, not detectable by humans. It may be that most cats share the same quickness, but even so, in Chibi’s case, it was acute—she was, after all, the cat of Lightning Alley. My wife got into the habit of pointing to the cat whenever it went by, extolling (extolling - praising) its virtues. . . .\
 \
 (paragraph 6) Chibi, who loved to play ball, gradually began to visit us on her own and would try and get us to play with her. She would step gingerly into the room and gaze intently at its occupants, then purposefully turn around and walk back out, as if to lead us to the garden. This process would be repeated until she got a response. Most of the time my wife would put down whatever she was doing, slip happily into her sandals and head outside.\
 \
 (paragraph 7) Having played to her heart’s content, Chibi would come inside and rest for a while. When she began to sleep on the sofa—like a talisman (talisman - an object thought to bring good luck) curled gently in the shape of a comma and dug up from a prehistoric archaeological site—a deep sense of happiness arrived, as if the house itself had dreamed this scene.\
 \
 (paragraph 8) Avoiding the prying eyes of the landlady, we began leaving it up to Chibi to come inside the house whenever she wanted—and with this new development I had begun little by little to understand cat lovers. Whether on TV or in all of the ubiquitous (ubiquitous - present everywhere) cat calendars, it seemed as if there was no cat comparable to her. But, though I had started to think of her as the best cat around, she was not really our cat.\
 \
 (paragraph 9) First we would hear the tinkling of the bell, and then she would appear, so we began to call her by the nickname “Tinkerbell.” Whenever we wanted her to come over, this name seemed to find itself on our lips.\
 \
 (paragraph 10) “I wonder where Tinkerbell is.” By the time my wife had gotten the words out of her mouth we’d hear the tinkling of Chibi’s bell. We’d realize that she was near at the point where, exiting the foyer next door (located at the second corner of Lightning Alley), Chibi would leap through the tear in the wire-mesh boundary of the property, dash along the side of the building, turn at the far end of the veranda, leap up onto the open area of the deck, and then, placing her front paws on the window frame at about the height of a human adult’s knee, stretch out her neck to peek inside.\
 \
 (paragraph 11) In winter she came inside. Little by little, through the crack in the partially opened window, her tendency to visit subtly developed; her appearances were repeated until, as if a silken opening in a fabric had been continuously moistened and stretched, Chibi had entered our lives. But at the same time—call it fate if you will—something else was closing in and pressing itself against that tendency.\
How does the narrator’s point of view shift in paragraphs 7 and 8?\
(A) He grows concerned the landlady will discover the cat.\
 (B) He starts to think about keeping the cat.\
 (C) He becomes worried for the safety of the cat.\
 (D) He begins to feel affection toward the cat.\

Base your answers to questions 1 and 2 on the passage below and on your knowledge of social studies.\
 \
 . . . Spain’s stubborn possession of the Mississippi’s mouth kept alive the possibility that the United States would rip itself apart. Yet something unexpected changed the course of history. In 1791, Africans enslaved in the French Caribbean colony of Saint-Domingue [Haiti] exploded in a revolt unprecedented in human history. Saint-Domingue, the eastern third of the island of Hispaniola, was at that time the ultimate sugar island, the imperial engine of French economic growth. But on a single August night, the mill of the first slavery’s growth stopped turning. All across Saint-Domingue’s sugar country, the most profitable stretch of real estate on the planet, enslaved people burst into the country mansions. They slaughtered enslavers, set torches to sugar houses and cane fields, and then marched by the thousand on Cap-Français, the seat of colonial rule. Thrown back, they regrouped. Revolt spread across the colony. . . .\

Two Days With No Phone\
 by Sarah Jane Brian\
 Experts worry that teen texting is out of control. Could you give up your phone for 48 hours? Our brave volunteers did.\
 (paragraph 1) Instead of sleeping, Kenny Alarcon, 16, often texts with his friends through the night. \"You get an urge'\" explains the teen, who lives in the Bronx in New York City. \"When I get a text, I'm itching to respond to it even if I want to sleep.\"\
 (paragraph 2) Franchesca Garcia, a high school senior from Providence, Rhode Island, has also felt the need to stay constantly connected. We asked how many texts she sent and received each day. \"I don't know . . . maybe 1,000?\" she answered. \"It's too many to count.\"\
 (paragraph 3) It probably won't surprise you that teens are texting more than ever before. Some experts are worried about how all that texting is affecting teenagers' lives.\
 \
 Teens in Trouble?\
 \
 (paragraph 4) One concern is that students might not learn correct grammar and spelling if most of the writing they do is made up of text messages. Some people also worry that because teens text so much, they don't spend enough time talking with others face-to-face. That could be hurting their relationships with friends and family.\
 (paragraph 5) Plus, all that texting (and time on social media) takes away from hours that could be spent studying, exercising, pursuing a hobby, or just relaxing.\
 (paragraph 6) Dr. Elizabeth Dowdell is a professor at Villanova University in Pennsylvania. She says that many people expect to be able to access anyone or to be accessed by anyone at any time. \"It's very appealing, especially to a middle or high school student,\" she explains. \"The problem is, there's no downtime.\" And people need downtime-especially when it comes to sleep.\
 \
 Sleep Texting\
 \
 (paragraph 7) Both Franchesca and Kenny told us that they wake up several times during the night to text. Kenny even sleeps with his phone beneath his pillow.\
 (paragraph 8) Dr. Dowdell says that it's common for teens' sleep to be interrupted by texts. Sometimes teens even send texts filled with nonsense words when they don't wake up all the way. She has been studying this trend, which she calls \"sleep texting.\"\
 (paragraph 9) Why is sleep texting a problem? \"Adolescents need a solid 8, 10, even 1 1 hours of sleep to really function and to think clearly\", reports Dr. Dowdell. If they regularly lose sleep, she adds, teens may start having trouble in school. They may become grumpy, angry, or depressed. A lack of sleep can lead to weight gain and even obesity. That's because many people turn to junk food for quick energy when they are tired.\
 \
 The 48-Hour Challenge\
 \
 (paragraph 10) According to Dr. Dowdell, teens need to learn that they can-and should-turn off their phones sometimes. So we decided to have Kenny and Franchesca do an experiment.\
 (paragraph 11) These were the rules: No phone for 48 hours. No computer or Internet either, unless it was for schoolwork. No Twitter, no Instagram.\
 (paragraph 12) Would these two teenagers be able to do it?\
 (paragraph 13) \"I think I'm going to feel really isolated\", Kenny worried. Franchesca was nervous but brave. \"I'm excited for the challenge\", she said. \"I don't know what's going to happen.\"\
 (paragraph 14) Kenny and Franchesca handed their phones to their mothers for safekeeping. The\
 challenge was on.\
 \
 The Results\
 \
 (paragraph 15) We caught up with Kenny and Franchesca after 48 phone-free hours. \"Wow, it was pure torture\", Kenny joked. But though life with no phone wasn't easy, he admitted \"it had benefits.\"\
 (paragraph 16) Sure, Kenny missed his friends, and he was sad at times. But he also felt relief from the constant texting. \"Sometimes it's teenager drama, people gossiping\" he explained. \"I felt less stressed because I didn't have to be involved.\"\
 (paragraph 17) Instead of texting, Kenny went to the gym and caught up on schoolwork. The first night, he told us, \"I slept for 18 hours!\" He also spent time sitting with his family and talking. Kenny's mom helped him with homework for the first time in two years. Said Kenny, \"I felt closer to my parents.\"\
 (paragraph 18) Franchesca had an even happier result when she put away her phone. \"I loved it!\" she said. \"I was going to the gym and hanging out with friends and playing basketball. I had a wonderful experience.\" She slept better too.\
 (paragraph 19) Franchesca decided to continue the experiment for a while. \"I think I'll be so much smarter and healthier,' she explained. \"Everybody in the world should try it.\"\
 (paragraph 20) Kenny doesn't plan to give up his phone again. But he now knows that he can live without it. Said the teen, \"It was a reality check.\"\
How were Kenny's and Franchesca's reactions to the 48-hour challenge different?\
(A) Only Franchesca benefitted from better sleep with no texting interruptions.\
 (B) Only Franchesca fully appreciated the freedom of having no phone.\
 (C) Only Kenny participated in physical activities instead of constant texting.\
 (D) Only Kenny spent time talking with people after giving up the phone.\

Reading Comprehension Passage C\
 \
 “The Russell-Einstein Manifesto,” signed by a group of eleven intellectuals and scientists including Bertrand Russell and Albert Einstein, was written at the height of the Cold War.\
 \
 In the tragic situation which confronts humanity, we feel that scientists should\
 assemble in conference to appraise the perils that have arisen as a result of the development\
 of weapons of mass destruction, and to discuss a resolution in the spirit of the appended\
 draft.\
 \
 (line 5) We are speaking on this occasion, not as members of this or that nation, continent, or\
 creed, but as human beings, members of the species Man, whose continued existence is in\
 doubt. The world is full of conflicts; and, overshadowing all minor conflicts, the titanic\
 struggle between Communism and anti-Communism. …\
 \
 We have to learn to think in a new way. We have to learn to ask ourselves, not what steps\
 (line 10) can be taken to give military victory to whatever group we prefer, for there no longer are\
 such steps; the question we have to ask ourselves is: what steps can be taken to prevent a\
 military contest of which the issue must be disastrous to all parties? …\
 \
 No doubt in an H-bomb (H-bomb — hydrogen bomb) war great cities would be obliterated. But this is one of the\
 minor disasters that would have to be faced. If everybody in London, New York, and\
 (line 15) Moscow were exterminated, the world might, in the course of a few centuries, recover from\
 the blow. But we now know, especially since the Bikini test, (Bikini test — reference to an American test of a hydrogen bomb conducted at the Bikini Atoll in the Pacific Ocean on March 1st, 1954. The bomb sent radioactive debris across the globe) that nuclear bombs can\
 gradually spread destruction over a very much wider area than had been supposed. …\
 \
 Many warnings have been uttered by eminent men of science and by authorities in\
 military strategy. None of them will say that the worst results are certain. What they do say\
 (line 20) is that these results are possible, and no one can be sure that they will not be realized. We\
 have not yet found that the views of experts on this question depend in any degree upon\
 their politics or prejudices. They depend only, so far as our researches have revealed, upon\
 the extent of the particular expert’s knowledge. We have found that the men who know most\
 are the most gloomy.\
 \
 (line 25) Here, then, is the problem which we present to you, stark and dreadful and inescapable:\
 Shall we put an end to the human race; or shall mankind renounce war? People will not face\
 this alternative because it is so difficult to abolish war.\
 \
 The abolition of war will demand distasteful limitations of national sovereignty. But\
 what perhaps impedes understanding of the situation more than anything else is that the\
 (line 30) term “mankind” feels vague and abstract. People scarcely realize in imagination that the\
 danger is to themselves and their children and their grandchildren, and not only to a dimly\
 apprehended humanity. They can scarcely bring themselves to grasp that they, individually,\
 and those whom they love are in imminent (imminent — about to take place) danger of perishing agonizingly. And so they\
 hope that perhaps war may be allowed to continue provided modern weapons are\
 (line 35) prohibited.\
 \
 This hope is illusory. Whatever agreements not to use H-bombs had been reached in\
 time of peace, they would no longer be considered binding in time of war, and both sides\
 would set to work to manufacture H-bombs as soon as war broke out, for, if one side\
 manufactured the bombs and the other did not, the side that manufactured them would\
 (line 40) inevitably be victorious.\
 \
 Although an agreement to renounce nuclear weapons as part of a general reduction of\
 armaments would not afford an ultimate solution, it would serve certain important purposes.\
 First: any agreement between East and West is to the good in so far as it tends to diminish\
 tension. Second: the abolition of thermo-nuclear weapons, if each side believed that the\
 (line 45) other had carried it out sincerely, would lessen the fear of a sudden attack in the style of\
 Pearl Harbour, which at present keeps both sides in a state of nervous apprehension. We\
 should, therefore, welcome such an agreement, though only as a first step.\
 \
 Most of us are not neutral in feeling, but, as human beings, we have to remember that,\
 if the issues between East and West are to be decided in any manner that can give any\
 (line 50) possible satisfaction to anybody, whether Communist or anti-Communist, whether Asian or\
 European or American, whether White or Black, then these issues must not be decided by\
 war. We should wish this to be understood, both in the East and in the West.\
 \
 There lies before us, if we choose, continual progress in happiness, knowledge, and\
 wisdom. Shall we, instead, choose death, because we cannot forget our quarrels? We\
 (line 55) appeal, as human beings, to human beings: Remember your humanity, and forget the rest.\
 If you can do so, the way lies open to a new Paradise; if you cannot, there lies before you\
 the risk of universal death.\
 \
 Resolution\
 \
 We invite this Congress, (Congress — the group of scientists who signed the Manifesto) and through it the scientists of the world and the general\
 public, to subscribe to the following resolution:\
 \
 (line 60) “In view of the fact that in any future world war nuclear weapons will certainly be\
 employed, and that such weapons threaten the continued existence of mankind, we urge\
 the Governments of the world to realize, and to acknowledge publicly, that their\
 purpose cannot be furthered by a world war, and we urge them, consequently, to find\
 peaceful means for the settlement of all matters of dispute between them.”\
 \
 —Bertrand Russell\
 excerpted from “The Russell–Einstein Manifesto”\
 July 9, 1955\
The phrase “dimly apprehended” (lines 31 and 32) suggests that average people’s understanding of the concept of mankind is\
(1) realistic\
 (2) limited\
 (3) pessimistic\
 (4) insightful\

Excerpt from One-Eyed Cat\
 by Paula Fox\
 \
 Ned loved snow, the whisper when he walked through it, a sound like candles being\
 blown out, the coming indoors out of it into the warmth, and standing on the register in\
 the big hall through which the dusty, metal-smelling heat blew up, and the going back out\
 again, shivering, cold, stooping and scooping up a handful to make a snowball, packing it\
 (line 5) hard with wet mittens, hefting it, tossing it as far as he could, and the runners of his sled\
 whispering across it as he sleighed down the slopes which were smooth and glittering and\
 hard, like great jewels.\
 On the first of December, there was a heavy snowfall. When Ned looked out of his\
 window the next morning, the river glowed like a snake made out of light as it wound\
 (line 10) among the snow-covered mountains.\
 He ate breakfast hastily, too preoccupied to read the story on the cereal box.\
 Mrs. Scallop (Mrs. Scallop: Ned’s family’s housekeeper) was broody this morning and left him a lone, her glance passing over him as\
 it passed over the kitchen chairs.\
 On the porch, he paused to take deep breaths of air which tasted, he imagined, like\
 (line 15) water from the center of the ocean, then he waded into the snow, passing the Packard (Packard: a brand of car that is no longer manufactured), its\
 windows white and hidden, the crabapple tree with its weighted branches, down the long\
 hill trying to guess if he was anywhere near the buried driveway. By the time he reached\
 Mr. Scully’s house, his galoshes were topped with snow and his feet were wet. Mr. Scully’s\
 shades were drawn; the house had a pinched look as though it felt the cold.\
 (line 20) Ned went around to the back until he could see the shed. There were boot tracks in\
 the snow leading to it and returning to the back door. He guessed the old man had taken\
 in the cat’s bowl; it was nowhere to be seen. You couldn’t leave anything out in this\
 weather, it would freeze. Mr. Scully had told him that finding water in the winter was a\
 big problem for animals. Licking the snow or ice could make them sick.\
 (line 25) Ned stared hard at the shed. Perhaps the cat was inside, squeezed in behind logs in a\
 tight space where its own breath would keep it warm. He was going to be late to school if\
 he didn’t get a move on, but he kept looking hard all over the yard as though he could\
 make the cat appear out of snow and gray sky. Twice, his glance passed over the icebox.\
 The third time, he saw that the motionless mound on top of it was not only the quilt but\
 (line 30) the cat, joined into one shape by a dusting of snow.\
 Ned held his breath for a moment, then put his own feet in Mr. Scully’s tracks and\
 went toward the shed. The tracks had frozen and they crunched under Ned’s weight, but\
 the cat didn’t raise its head. Ned halted a few feet away from it—but of course, he realized,\
 it wouldn’t hear him because of its deaf ear. He could have gone closer to it than he’d ever\
 (line 35) been but he had a sudden vision of the cat exploding into fear when it finally did\
 hear him.\
 When he got back to the front of the house, he saw fresh footsteps on the road. He\
 could tell it was the road because of the deep ditches which fell away to either side. He\
 guessed they were Billy’s tracks. It was odd to think that Billy, huffing and puffing, had\
 (line 40) gone past Mr. Scully’s place, thinking his own thoughts, while he, Ned, only a few yards\
 away, had been searching for the cat. He found Evelyn’s tracks, too, and later on, Janet’s,\
 the smallest of all. He felt ghostly as if he’d been left alone on a white, silent globe.\
 Somewhere in the evergreen woods, snow must have slid off a bough, for he heard the\
 loud plop, then the fainter sound of the bough springing up, relieved of the weight. He\
 (line 45) thought about the cat, visualizing how it had looked on the quilt. How still it had been!\
 Why hadn’t he gone right up to it, looked at it close, touched its fur? Why had it been so\
 motionless—still as death, still as a dead vole he’d seen last summer in the grass near the\
 well? He came to the snow-covered blacktop road upon which a few cars had left their\
 ridged tire tracks. He had a strong impulse to turn back, to play hooky for the first time in\
 (line 50) his life. Mr. Scully, with his poor eyesight, might not spot the cat on top of the icebox,\
 might not, then, set food out for it. Fretting and shivering, his feet numb, Ned went on\
 to school.\
 He tried very hard to concentrate on his lessons, to watch Miss Jefferson’s plump, even\
 handwriting on the blackboard as she wrote out the lines from a poem by Thomas Gray\
 (line 55) that the class was to memorize that week, but try as he might, the image of the unmoving\
 animal on the ragged old quilt persisted. Last week, on a rainy afternoon, the cat had\
 looked at Ned, had cocked its head as though to see him better. Its one eye, narrowed, had\
 reminded him of a grain of wheat.\
 “The curfew tolls the knell of parting day,\
 (line 60) The lowing herd wind slowly o’er the lea . . .”\
 Ned read the lines several times before copying them down in his copybook. The\
 words made no sense to him. It was this that had made his hours in school so hard ever\
 since he and Mr. Scully had seen the cat last autumn, this drawing away of his attention\
 from everything that was going on around him. He was either relieved because the cat was\
 (line 65) where he could see it or fearful because he didn’t know where it was.\
Lines 20 through 24 contribute to the development of the plot by\
(A) showing that Ned and Mr. Scully are friends\
 (B) describing the challenges of dealing with heavy snow\
 (C) suggesting that Mr. Scully has been neglecting the cat\
 (D) describing weather conditions that can be dangerous for the cat\

Tracking the Big Horn\
 \
 Bighorn sheep, Ovis canadensis, are a majestic symbol of the mountainous West. They browse at high altitudes and in steep, rocky areas from Texas to British Columbia. Rams’ horns curl around their eyes and grow up to 45 inches long. Males butt horns to establish dominance during the fall rut [mating season]. Ewes [females] sport shorter, spiked horns similar to a mountain goat’s. From their first days of life, bighorns are surefooted enough to scale cliffs too steep for most predators to follow.…\
 \
 Two centuries ago, an estimated 1.5 million to 2 million bighorn sheep lived in North America; today, a mere 28,000 remain. Diseases caught from domestic sheep, competition from livestock for forage, and trophy hunting for their horns caused populations to plummet [drop rapidly]. Bighorns graze in mountain meadows, habitat that is being lost to expanding forests, which are growing beyond their historic boundaries in part because the wildfires that are used to hold them in check have been suppressed. Glacier National Park, home to 400 to 600 bighorn sheep, lists the animals as a “species of concern,” that is, at risk\
 of becoming endangered.…\

Clash of the Condiments: Wasabi vs. the Chili Pepper\
 by Mary Beth Cox\
 \
 Most condiments are peaceable enough. The sauces, spreads, and pickles of the world\
 add flavor to our foods without kicking up much of a fuss. This is not true of the pungent\
 or “hot’’ condiments. They are more aggressive. They get our attention by purposely\
 causing us pain. These strong-armed seasonings are often the source of friendly\
 (line 5) competitions. Loyal fans will contend that their favorite pungent condiment is the one that\
 packs the most powerful punch. Ladies and gentlemen, you are cordially welcomed to just\
 such a contest. Here it is, the Match of the Moment: Wasabi vs. the Chili Pepper.\
 IN YOUR CORNERS\
 Introducing in the Green Corner, hailing from the island nation of Japan, sushi’s\
 inseparable sidekick: Wasabi! Wasabia japonica grows wild on the cool, damp banks of\
 (line 10) Japan’s many mountain streams. The chill of its habitat is quite ironic since wasabi is\
 famous for bringing the heat. The plant is a botanical relative of mustard and horseradish.\
 Pungency runs in the family. Traditionally, wasabi is prepared by grating its rootstock on\
 the abrasive skin of an angel shark. Authentic wasabi is relatively rare and difficult to\
 come by. The emerald condiment that is served outside of Japan is almost always\
 (line 15) horseradish pulp dyed with green food coloring. Whether the wasabi is real or whether it’s\
 the more common substitute, a whopping snootful will make you cry for your momma!\
 And in the red corner, originating from the Central and South Americas, now an\
 international culinary superstar: the Chili Pepper. Chili peppers are fruits of the plants of\
 the botanical genus Capsicum. They are related to the tomato and the eggplant. They’re\
 (line 20) the renegades in an otherwise mild-mannered botanical family. Chili peppers include but\
 are not limited to the poblano, the cayenne, the jalapeño, the tabasco, the habanero, and\
 the serrano. One of these culprits sometimes goes by the alias “chipotle.’’ A chipotle\
 (pronounced chee-POHT-lay) is none other than a dried smoked jalape ño. Chilies were\
 introduced to the non-American world by Christopher Columbus, who mistakenly\
 (line 25) identified them as variants of black pepper. Chilies have since taken the culinary world by\
 storm. They appear alongside dishes served around the globe, from the Basque provinces\
 to North Africa and the Middle East, to India and Southeast Asia. A potent chili pepper in\
 the kisser will make you rue the day you were born!\
 POWERFUL PUNCHES\
 Both wasabi and chilies are condiments of world-class pungency. But how do they\
 (line 30) match up head to head? Each has its own unique tactical move. Each has its own special\
 point of attack. The active ingredient of the wasabi plant is stored stealthily in its cells.\
 Under normal growing conditions, this ingredient is completely harmless. It’s not until the\
 plant’s cells are ruptured (as by the grating action of angel shark skin) that the trouble\
 begins. Enzymes convert the ingredient into molecules of allyl isothiocyanate. It’s the\
 (line 35) chemical characteristics of these irritating molecules that are the secret to wasabi’s\
 pungency. Allyl isothiocyanate molecules are lightweight. They are volatile. They are also\
 soluble in water. As a consequence, the consumption of wasabi launches an airborne\
 assault on the consumer’s sinuses. Allyl isothiocyanate molecules waft up the nose and\
 back of the throat. They dissolve in the watery fluids they find there. They intercept nerve\
 (line 40) endings in the nasal passages. Specifically, these molecules target pain receptors of the\
 type known as TRPA I . TRPA I receptors respond to the attack by sending emergency\
 signals to the brain: “Yikes . . . we’ve gotten hold of something painfully hot!’’\
 Chili peppers conduct operations of a different sort. Their active ingredient is a\
 substance called capsaicin. It’s found in the spongy inner tissue of peppers, but it can leak\
 (line 45) onto the seeds and inner wall of the fruit. Capsaicin molecules are heavier than the\
 molecules of wasabi’s allyl isothiocyanate. They are not volatile. They prefer to dissolve in\
 oils, so they aren’t as easily dissolved in water. Capsaicin molecules instigate an incendiary\
 assault upon contact with exposed vulnerable surfaces. They cling to the tender tissues of\
 the lips, mouth, and throat. They burn eyes that are rubbed with capsaicin-laced fingers.\
 (line 50) Capsaicin molecules interact with pain receptors of the type TRPV I. Again an alert is\
 expedited to the brain: “Mayday! Mayday! Let’s not eat any more of that, please!’’\
 WHERE’S THE REFEREE?\
 So which of these condiments causes the most pain? To settle any contest, a scoring\
 system is required. There is a way to compare the relative heat intensities of the various\
 chili peppers. It’s called the Scoville scale. Scoville ratings are determined by brave human\
 (line 55) test subjects who willingly sip extracts of chili pepper juice. Extracted juices are diluted\
 again and again until their heat can no longer be detected. A high rating on the Scoville\
 scale means that a lot of dilutions are necessary to eliminate the pain caused by a\
 particular pepper. Unfortunately, Scoville ratings are not applicable to wasabi. The method\
 is specifically designed to extract capsaicin from chili peppers. It doesn’t work for allyl\
 (line 60) isothiocyanate, or for anything else.\
 Pepper pungencies are also compared by using chromatography. Chromatography is an\
 analytical technique that separates the chemical components of a mixture. After\
 separation, the amounts of each component are quantified. Chromatography can\
 determine how much capsaicin is in a pepper. It can also determine how much allyl\
 (line 65) isothiocyanate is in wasabi. If two chili peppers have the same amount of capsaicin, it can\
 be assumed that those peppers are equally “hot.’’ But the same assumption cannot be made\
 when comparing chili peppers to wasabi. There’s no way to know if equal amounts of\
 capsaicin and allyl isothiocyanate cause equal degrees of pain. So chromatography cannot\
 definitively judge this contest.\
 (line 70) It isn’t even possible to directly measure and compare nerve responses, since\
 two different types of pain receptors are involved. Wasabi and chili peppers are like\
 pungent apples and oranges. There’s no objective way to declare one more potent than the\
 other. This friendly competition won’t be settled anytime soon. Everyone is free to chime\
 in with an opinion. You just have to try both of these pungent powerhouses, then root for\
 (line 75) your own favorite flavor of pain.\
What is the role of the section “Powerful Punches” in the development of the article?\
(A) It describes the physical differences between wasabi and chili peppers.\
 (B) It explains the best ways to experience the heat from wasabi and chili peppers.\
 (C) It describes why wasabi and chili peppers are both enjoyable and painful to consume.\
 (D) It provides a scientific explanation for the effects of consuming wasabi and chili peppers.\

Reading Comprehension Passage A\
 \
 Screeno\
 In the following passage, Cornelius Schmidt seeks refuge from a gloomy, rainy night by going to a movie. \
 \
 …At the door [of the theater] the uniformed ticket taker gave him a card on which was \
 printed a kind of checkerboard, having in each box a number. It was obviously the old game \
 of Lotto, the object being to get five numbers which were successive either horizontally or\
 vertically or in a diagonal. In the center, amid numbered boxes, was a box entitled\
 (line 5) GRATIS; (GRATIS - free, a space that could count as any number called) the management gave this box to the audience. …\
    The theatre fell into a semi-darkness, not the movie darkness, but one in which discreet\
 lights shone on both sides of the theatre and both sides of the stage. A white and pink\
 clockface flashed on the screen. It was, in fact, like a roulette wheel, and had numbers\
 running from 1 to 100. In the center was a pointer, which suddenly began to whirl furiously \
 (line 10) about the clockface, and then slowed down, and then stopped.\
    \"Ninety-nine!\" said the businesslike yet airy young man in an authoritative voice.\
 An usher wrote down the number upon a blackboard to the right of the screen. The pointer \
 spun again, at a tremendous pace, so that it was almost a moving blur for a moment, and\
 then clarified into its arrow-like straightness. The actual wheel was, of course, in the\
 (line 15) projection room.\
    \"Fifty-four!\" said the young master of ceremonies, simulating a dramatic tone.\
    \"SCREENO!\" cried a voice from the balcony in a mocking voice, while everyone\
 laughed, for obviously no one could have SCREENO as yet.\
    \"I am sorry, ladies and gentlemen,\" said the young man in an affable (affable - friendly) voice,\" but we will \
 (line 20) have to ask you not to be humorous about this. After all, money is involved, and there has\
 been much confusion in the past because various people insisted upon trying to be\
 funny.\"…\
    The pointer was revolving again. \"Thirty-nine!\" announced the young man. The\
 audience was not yet warmed up, because too few numbers had been called for anyone to \
 (line 25) be on the verge of winning. Cornelius, however, also had this third number and was pleased \
 no little by the course of events.\
    \"Forty-nine!\" announced the young man. …\
    \"Fourteen!\" cried the young man into the microphone which made his voice even more\
 official than otherwise. Cornelius did not have the number. He assured himself that the\
 (line 30) game was a fraud, that the management was obviously not going to permit anyone to win so \
 much money and that the whole business would obviously be controlled in the projection \
 room or by arranging the numbers on the cards. There was only one more chance, a drop\
 in the ocean. He slouched back in his seat, chiding himself for his great excitement. …\
    \"Twenty-five!\" the master of ceremonies called out.\
 (line 35)    \"Twenty-five! Twenty-five!\" said Cornelius to himself, and then, finding the number on\
 his card as the fifth consecutive horizontal number, he rose in his seat and shouted:\
    \"SCREENO!\" in a too loud voice which broke, and began to issue (to issue - to exit) from his aisle,\
 tripping over the feet of the people seated near him, some of whom were solicitous (solicitous - helpful) of his\
 walk, and eager to provide good advice as he passed. The attractiveness of the winner shone\
 (line 40) in him. …\
    An usher took his card, and checked it with the numbers on the blackboard. The young\
 man came over to oversee the usher. It seemed as if something was wrong, someone\
 had miscalculated, to look at the young man. The checking was done several times.\
 Very bureaucratic, said Cornelius to himself. Recovering, as the checkup proved that\
 (line 45) Cornelius had indeed won, he shook Cornelius’s hand and the whole theatre lighted up.\
    \"Lucky fellow,\" cried the balcony voice, amusing the audience again, by the envious\
 tone in his voice. …\
    The usher arrived with the money just as the persistent balcony voice called out,\
 \"Let’s go on with the show,\" and the audience began to clap again, wishing to have its\
 (line 50) chance at the other prizes.\
    But then, as the money was delivered to the young assistant manager, and he began\
 officiously to count it out, shuffle it, and arrange it, before paying Cornelius, a hoarse and \
 disused voice cried from the balcony:\
    \"SCREENO! SCREENO!\" …\
 (line 55)   \"SCREENO!\" came the voice again, this time nearer, as the new winner approached\
 the stairs from the balcony to the orchestra. The young assistant manager and the ushers \
 looked at each other in dismay. Something had obviously gone wrong, for usually no one\
 won the jackpot; two winners was inconceivable and would lead to bankruptcy. Someone\
 was going to lose his job because of this. …\
 (line 60)   \"My name is Casper Weingarten,\" said the old man, unasked, intruding himself upon\
 the huddle of the assistant manager and the ushers. He was very nervous, very excited.\
 \"I am a musician,\" he said, but no one paid any attention to him, except Cornelius.\
    And then the young assistant manager came over to the old man and, holding the card\
 up, showed him that he had not won, that he had mistaken a 7 for a 1 because the print had\
 (line 65) been on the left-hand side. \"Perhaps you’ll win one of the other prizes,\" he said,\
 courteously, \"since you already have four numbers in a row.\" …\
    Cornelius came over to look into the matter for himself. He took the card in his hand\
 and looked at the number in question. The old man looked at him, and then turned to the\
 assistant manager, saying:\
 (line 70)   \"Give me my money! I have won!\" …\
    \"Look here,\" said Cornelius tactfully to the assistant manager, \"it seems to me that you\
 can only assume that this is a 1. The blur is too faint to make it a seven.\"\
    \"I know it is a 7,\" said the assistant manager angrily, and when he said that, Cornelius\
 recognized immediately that he was so sure because the cards had been prepared in\
 (line 75) advance to obviate the possibility of two winners of the jackpot, or even one. Seeing this,\
 Cornelius began to feel sick and angry, as he always did when confronted with fraud or\
 cheating.\
    \"All my life I’ve been cheated,\" said the old man, wringing his hands. \"Give me my\
 money.\" An usher took his arm, as if to lead him from the stage, but the assistant manager\
 (line 80) deterred him, unwilling as yet to resort to force. …\
    \"My good man,\" said the assistant manager, \"Your hard luck is not my fault, nor this\
 theatre’s responsibility. Please do not cause a disturbance. Now if both of you will leave the\
 stage, we can go on with the other prizes and with the show.\"\
    In answer, the old man sat down upon the stage, looking grotesque there, with his head\
 (line 85) turned up. \"I will sit here until I am paid,\" he said tearfully. …\
    But the audience was won over, for no one wished to lose his chance at the remaining\
 $50. There was a murmuring of voices and someone cried out:\
    \"Go home and give us a chance.\" …\
    \"Call a cop,\" said another. …\
 (line 90)   Cornelius meditated with himself for a moment and then said: \"Listen, I will give you\
 half of the jackpot. Come on before you’re arrested.\" …\
    \"No,\" said Weingarten, \"I don’t want your money. I want mine. Give me my money,\"\
 he said towards the assistant manager.\
    Cornelius considered matters with himself again and came to a decision. Easy come,\
 (line 95) easy go, he said to himself, and then he told the old musician that he could have the whole\
 jackpot. The manager protested immediately, but Cornelius took the bills from his pocket\
 and began to count them out and give them to the musician, who accepted them with\
 a guilty look and trembling hands.\
    The audience saw what was happening and applauded vigorously, not because it was\
 (line 100) genuinely moved, but because it felt that it ought to applaud. Such applause is heard at\
 public gatherings when an abstraction too vacuous (vacuous - insincere) is mentioned or tribute is paid to a man\
 long dead. The assistant manager, trying to move in on Cornelius’s credit, came over to\
 shake hands with Cornelius. Cornelius, tempted to reject the proffered hand, accepted it\
 because he wished to cause no further disturbance.\
 (line 105)   The old man had risen and come over to Cornelius.\
    \"Thank you very much for your kindness,\" he said in the estranged voice of those who\
 have been weeping or overexcited.\
    \"Not at all,\" said Cornelius formally. Both descended from the stage together. …\

Excerpt from A la Carte\
 \
 by Tanita S. Davis\
 \
 (paragraph 1) “Homework?” My mother mouths the word exaggeratedly, eyebrows raised, and I roll my eyes. Frowning, she points with her chin to the side door that leads to the stairs. I roll my eyes again, mouthing, Okay, okay, not needing her to pantomime further what she wants me to do. I hate the thought of leaving the clattering nerve center of the restaurant to wrestle with my trigonometry homework in my mother’s quiet office downstairs.\
 \
 (paragraph 2) “Order!”\
 \
 (paragraph 3) The bright lights and swirl of noise and motion are muffled as the kitchen door swings closed behind me.\
 \
 (paragraph 4) It’s hard to remember a time when the restaurant hasn’t been the center of our lives. Mom used to be a copy editor and wrote food features for our local paper, the Clarion, and she met Pia when she did a write-up on the culinary school Pia attended. Pia thinks it was fate that Mom wanted to invest in a restaurant at the same time Pia wanted to buy the old bank building.\
 \
 (paragraph 5) La Salle Rouge doesn’t serve much in the way of “kid” food, since the menu doesn’t cater to people my age on a cheap date, but I’ve loved everything about it from the first. I started experimenting with being a vegetarian when I turned fourteen, but Pia still found things to feed me and taught me to be creative with vegetables and tofu. I like to think I’m the best-fed vegetarian in the state of California.\
 \
 (paragraph 6) Pia’s been really good about teaching what she knows, and I decided early on that this is the work I want to do—get out of school and get into the kitchen for good. Mom and Pia have created a popular French-Asian-Californian fusion restaurant that has gotten great reviews from food critics. They took the best of each other’s tastes—Mom’s traditional Southern flavors and Pia’s French training combined with her vegetable- and spice-savvy Cambodian tastes—and pulled off what one food critic called “stylized food with unique flavor combinations in an intimate setting.”\
 \
 (paragraph 7) Whatever that means.\
 \
 (paragraph 8) Three years ago, when I started high school thirty pounds heavier than everyone in my class, Mom and I came up with a light menu for La Salle Rouge, and it’s been such a popular idea that Mom lets me come up with tasty, low-calorie desserts, which is one of my favorite things to do. It hardly seems fair that I have to walk away from all of that just to do trigonometry, but my mom says I have to finish school before I concentrate on cooking. She says it’s smarter to have a “backup plan,” and she’s made me apply to plenty of colleges and check out business majors just in case I ever want to do anything else with my life. I guess that makes sense if you’re anybody other than me. When I turn eighteen, I already know what I’m going to do.\
 \
 (paragraph 9) First, I’m going to buy a plane ticket to D.C. and go to Julia Child’s kitchen at the Smithsonian and leave roses. They don’t let you walk through it, but somewhere—I don’t know where—I’m going to leave a bouquet and a little note for her. Julia Child is my patron saint. (patron saint - an inspiring person admired for his or her work) She’s the queen of all reasons people can do anything they want in life. Saint Julia didn’t start cooking until she was practically forty, and she went on to do TV shows and make cookbooks and be this huge part of culinary history. She never got too fancy, she never freaked out, and she was never afraid to try new things. I want to be just like her—except maybe get famous faster.\
 \
 (paragraph 10) The second thing I’m going to do is buy myself a set of knives. Pia swears by this set of German steel knives she got when she graduated, but I’ve seen the TV chef Kylie Kwong use a phenomenal-looking ceramic knife on her show on the Discovery Channel. Either way, knives are what the best chefs have of their very own.\
 \
 (paragraph 11) The third thing I’m going to do, after I get back from Washington and get my knives, is . . . get discovered. Somehow. I know I’m going to have to pay my dues, but I’m so ready for my real life to start. It’s not something I admit to a lot, but my real dream is to be a celebrity chef. Do you know how many African American female chefs there aren’t? And how many vegetarian chefs have their own shows? The field is wide open for stardom. Every time I watch old episodes of Saint Julia, I imagine that I have my own cooking show. The way celebrity chefs do it now, I could also have a line of cooking gear, cookbooks, aprons, the works. People would know my name, ask for my autograph, and try my recipes. All I have to do is finish my trig homework and get back into the kitchen.\
In paragraph 1, what does the phrase “clattering nerve center of the restaurant” suggest?\
(A) messiness, chaos\
 (B) energy, core\
 (C) tension, anxiety\
 (D) greatness, stability\

Base your answers to questions 7 and 8 on the passage below and on your knowledge of social studies.\
 \
 . . . Owing to the extensive use of machinery and to division of labor, the work of the proletarians has lost all individual character, and, consequently, all charm for the workman. He becomes an appendage [accessory] of the machine, and it is only the most simple, most monotonous, and most easily acquired knack [skill] that is required of him. Hence, the cost of production of a workman is restricted, almost entirely, to the means of subsistence that he requires for his maintenance, and for the propagation [reproduction] of his race. But the price of a commodity, and also of labor, is equal to its cost of production. In proportion, therefore, as the repulsiveness of the work increases, the wage decreases. Nay more, in proportion as the use of machinery and division of labor increases, in the same proportion the burden of toil also increases, whether by prolongation [stretching] of the working hours, by increase of the work exacted in a given time, or by increased speed of machinery, etc. . . .\

Reading Comprehension Passage A\
 \
 Screeno\
 In the following passage, Cornelius Schmidt seeks refuge from a gloomy, rainy night by going to a movie. \
 \
 …At the door [of the theater] the uniformed ticket taker gave him a card on which was \
 printed a kind of checkerboard, having in each box a number. It was obviously the old game \
 of Lotto, the object being to get five numbers which were successive either horizontally or\
 vertically or in a diagonal. In the center, amid numbered boxes, was a box entitled\
 (line 5) GRATIS; (GRATIS - free, a space that could count as any number called) the management gave this box to the audience. …\
    The theatre fell into a semi-darkness, not the movie darkness, but one in which discreet\
 lights shone on both sides of the theatre and both sides of the stage. A white and pink\
 clockface flashed on the screen. It was, in fact, like a roulette wheel, and had numbers\
 running from 1 to 100. In the center was a pointer, which suddenly began to whirl furiously \
 (line 10) about the clockface, and then slowed down, and then stopped.\
    \"Ninety-nine!\" said the businesslike yet airy young man in an authoritative voice.\
 An usher wrote down the number upon a blackboard to the right of the screen. The pointer \
 spun again, at a tremendous pace, so that it was almost a moving blur for a moment, and\
 then clarified into its arrow-like straightness. The actual wheel was, of course, in the\
 (line 15) projection room.\
    \"Fifty-four!\" said the young master of ceremonies, simulating a dramatic tone.\
    \"SCREENO!\" cried a voice from the balcony in a mocking voice, while everyone\
 laughed, for obviously no one could have SCREENO as yet.\
    \"I am sorry, ladies and gentlemen,\" said the young man in an affable (affable - friendly) voice,\" but we will \
 (line 20) have to ask you not to be humorous about this. After all, money is involved, and there has\
 been much confusion in the past because various people insisted upon trying to be\
 funny.\"…\
    The pointer was revolving again. \"Thirty-nine!\" announced the young man. The\
 audience was not yet warmed up, because too few numbers had been called for anyone to \
 (line 25) be on the verge of winning. Cornelius, however, also had this third number and was pleased \
 no little by the course of events.\
    \"Forty-nine!\" announced the young man. …\
    \"Fourteen!\" cried the young man into the microphone which made his voice even more\
 official than otherwise. Cornelius did not have the number. He assured himself that the\
 (line 30) game was a fraud, that the management was obviously not going to permit anyone to win so \
 much money and that the whole business would obviously be controlled in the projection \
 room or by arranging the numbers on the cards. There was only one more chance, a drop\
 in the ocean. He slouched back in his seat, chiding himself for his great excitement. …\
    \"Twenty-five!\" the master of ceremonies called out.\
 (line 35)    \"Twenty-five! Twenty-five!\" said Cornelius to himself, and then, finding the number on\
 his card as the fifth consecutive horizontal number, he rose in his seat and shouted:\
    \"SCREENO!\" in a too loud voice which broke, and began to issue (to issue - to exit) from his aisle,\
 tripping over the feet of the people seated near him, some of whom were solicitous (solicitous - helpful) of his\
 walk, and eager to provide good advice as he passed. The attractiveness of the winner shone\
 (line 40) in him. …\
    An usher took his card, and checked it with the numbers on the blackboard. The young\
 man came over to oversee the usher. It seemed as if something was wrong, someone\
 had miscalculated, to look at the young man. The checking was done several times.\
 Very bureaucratic, said Cornelius to himself. Recovering, as the checkup proved that\
 (line 45) Cornelius had indeed won, he shook Cornelius’s hand and the whole theatre lighted up.\
    \"Lucky fellow,\" cried the balcony voice, amusing the audience again, by the envious\
 tone in his voice. …\
    The usher arrived with the money just as the persistent balcony voice called out,\
 \"Let’s go on with the show,\" and the audience began to clap again, wishing to have its\
 (line 50) chance at the other prizes.\
    But then, as the money was delivered to the young assistant manager, and he began\
 officiously to count it out, shuffle it, and arrange it, before paying Cornelius, a hoarse and \
 disused voice cried from the balcony:\
    \"SCREENO! SCREENO!\" …\
 (line 55)   \"SCREENO!\" came the voice again, this time nearer, as the new winner approached\
 the stairs from the balcony to the orchestra. The young assistant manager and the ushers \
 looked at each other in dismay. Something had obviously gone wrong, for usually no one\
 won the jackpot; two winners was inconceivable and would lead to bankruptcy. Someone\
 was going to lose his job because of this. …\
 (line 60)   \"My name is Casper Weingarten,\" said the old man, unasked, intruding himself upon\
 the huddle of the assistant manager and the ushers. He was very nervous, very excited.\
 \"I am a musician,\" he said, but no one paid any attention to him, except Cornelius.\
    And then the young assistant manager came over to the old man and, holding the card\
 up, showed him that he had not won, that he had mistaken a 7 for a 1 because the print had\
 (line 65) been on the left-hand side. \"Perhaps you’ll win one of the other prizes,\" he said,\
 courteously, \"since you already have four numbers in a row.\" …\
    Cornelius came over to look into the matter for himself. He took the card in his hand\
 and looked at the number in question. The old man looked at him, and then turned to the\
 assistant manager, saying:\
 (line 70)   \"Give me my money! I have won!\" …\
    \"Look here,\" said Cornelius tactfully to the assistant manager, \"it seems to me that you\
 can only assume that this is a 1. The blur is too faint to make it a seven.\"\
    \"I know it is a 7,\" said the assistant manager angrily, and when he said that, Cornelius\
 recognized immediately that he was so sure because the cards had been prepared in\
 (line 75) advance to obviate the possibility of two winners of the jackpot, or even one. Seeing this,\
 Cornelius began to feel sick and angry, as he always did when confronted with fraud or\
 cheating.\
    \"All my life I’ve been cheated,\" said the old man, wringing his hands. \"Give me my\
 money.\" An usher took his arm, as if to lead him from the stage, but the assistant manager\
 (line 80) deterred him, unwilling as yet to resort to force. …\
    \"My good man,\" said the assistant manager, \"Your hard luck is not my fault, nor this\
 theatre’s responsibility. Please do not cause a disturbance. Now if both of you will leave the\
 stage, we can go on with the other prizes and with the show.\"\
    In answer, the old man sat down upon the stage, looking grotesque there, with his head\
 (line 85) turned up. \"I will sit here until I am paid,\" he said tearfully. …\
    But the audience was won over, for no one wished to lose his chance at the remaining\
 $50. There was a murmuring of voices and someone cried out:\
    \"Go home and give us a chance.\" …\
    \"Call a cop,\" said another. …\
 (line 90)   Cornelius meditated with himself for a moment and then said: \"Listen, I will give you\
 half of the jackpot. Come on before you’re arrested.\" …\
    \"No,\" said Weingarten, \"I don’t want your money. I want mine. Give me my money,\"\
 he said towards the assistant manager.\
    Cornelius considered matters with himself again and came to a decision. Easy come,\
 (line 95) easy go, he said to himself, and then he told the old musician that he could have the whole\
 jackpot. The manager protested immediately, but Cornelius took the bills from his pocket\
 and began to count them out and give them to the musician, who accepted them with\
 a guilty look and trembling hands.\
    The audience saw what was happening and applauded vigorously, not because it was\
 (line 100) genuinely moved, but because it felt that it ought to applaud. Such applause is heard at\
 public gatherings when an abstraction too vacuous (vacuous - insincere) is mentioned or tribute is paid to a man\
 long dead. The assistant manager, trying to move in on Cornelius’s credit, came over to\
 shake hands with Cornelius. Cornelius, tempted to reject the proffered hand, accepted it\
 because he wished to cause no further disturbance.\
 (line 105)   The old man had risen and come over to Cornelius.\
    \"Thank you very much for your kindness,\" he said in the estranged voice of those who\
 have been weeping or overexcited.\
    \"Not at all,\" said Cornelius formally. Both descended from the stage together. …\

Talking with Artists:\
 David Wiesner\
 compiled and edited by Pat Cummings\
 MY STORY\
 (paragraph 1) I think that I always knew I wanted to become an artist. I can't remember a time when I wasn't drawing and painting pictures. My oldest sister and my brother were artistic, and watching them draw fascinated me. They had many different art supplies around the house. There was, and still is, something very appealing about art materials: Boxes of pastels, with incredibly colored, thin, square sticks, fitting snugly into the slots in their trays. Little ink bottles with rubber stoppers and pens with interchangeable metal tips. The look, smell, and feel of rich black ink going onto bright white paper in broad, flat strokes or thin, sharp lines. I found this captivating.\
 (paragraph 2) In our town, the housepaint and wallpaper store also sold art supplies. I loved looking at all the exotic things they had for sale. Sandpaper blocks to sharpen pencils. Rows of numbered pencils, and erasers that could be pulled ike taffy. Thin drawers full of tubes of paint that seemed so much more grown up than the kind we used at school. Complicated easels and wooden boxes to hold everything.\
 (paragraph 3) My parents and friends soon saw that I had more than a passing interest in art. It came to define much of my image. Relatives gave me art-related birthday gifts. At school I became \"the kid who could draw\", a unique distinction, like \"brainiest\" or \"best athlete\"-but somehow different. A little weird, actually. I like that.\
 (paragraph 4) In my kindergarten class, we had an \"art corner\". There was an easel with a large pad of paper and poster paints. One day I was painting a picture of a red house. I can vividly recall my intense frustration because this picture just didn't look like I wanted it to.\
 (paragraph 5) As I got a little older, I began copying pictures: cartoons, comic books, and magazine illustrations. But mostly dinosaurs. I loved them. The World Book Encyclopedia published a book about the history of the earth, full of very realistic dinosaur pictures that I drew over and over again. They were in black and white and had a hazy quality to them (bad printing, I think). For a long time, even after I should have known better, I thought they were photographs of dinosaurs.\
 (paragraph 6) I found out a few years ago that these particular paintings are murals in the Chicago Field Museum. I've since seen them in person. They were painted by Charles Knight, the first and most famous painter of dinosaurs. They are still impressive, and they are in color!\
 (paragraph 7) My third-grade class wrote essays on what we wanted to be when we grew up. To me it was obvious. We read them aloud, and I told about the types of paintings I would some day try. I'd have turtles with paintbrushes tied to their backs walking around on a big sheet of paper (I got chuckles from the class and the teacher). Or I'd fill squirt guns with different colored paints and shoot at the canvas. I actually tried this with friends! Well, it sounded like a good idea.\
 (paragraph 8) One of the only discouraging childhood experiences about my artwork happened in the fourth grade. During study time I was drawing a picture. My teacher took it away and wrote an angry note home to my mother. \"David would rather be drawing pictures than doing his work!!!\" I couldn't believe it, three exclamation points. We didn't get along well for the rest of the year. School \"art classes\" were pretty uninspiring. I did my best work on textbook covers I made. Art never seemed to be taken as seriously as other subjects.\
 (paragraph 9) In the eighth grade, a big career day was held. Months before, we wrote suggestions for careers we wanted to hear about. On the big day, guest speakers from many fields came to talk. We each chose two sessions to attend, but there wasn't one that came close to an art-related field. I saw some guy talk about oceanography.\
 (paragraph 10) In high school it actually sank in that I was going to be an artist. My friends read catalogs and saw guidance counselors to pick what they'd study in college. I felt something was wrong. I already knew. I'd always known. I half expected to hear, \"No, put away those paints and choose a real career.\" My parents were excited about my choice, too. As I looked into art schools, I felt like doors were being thrown wide open. Until then my art was a private thing, but at art school I found a place where everyone was \"the kid who could draw.\"\
Read this sentence from paragraph 7.\
 Well, it sounded like a good idea.\
 What does the sentence suggest?\
(A) The teacher did not approve of Wiesner's future painting plans.\
 (B) The class was curious about the paintings Wiesner hoped to create.\
 (C) Wiesner and his friends liked painting a canvas with squirt guns.\
 (D) Painting with squirt guns did not turn out the way Wiesner expected.\

Reading Comprehension Passage C\
 Many Animals Can Count, Some Better Than You\
 \
 Every night during breeding season, the male túngara frog of Central America will stake\
 out a performance patch in the local pond and spend unbroken hours broadcasting\
 his splendor to the world.\
 The mud-brown frog is barely the size of a shelled pecan, but his call is large and\
 (line 5) dynamic, a long downward sweep that sounds remarkably like a phaser weapon on\
 \"Star Trek,\" followed by a brief, twangy, harmonically dense chuck.(chuck - a clucking sound)\
 Unless, that is, a competing male starts calling nearby, in which case the first frog is\
 likely to add two chucks to the tail of his sweep. And should his rival respond likewise,\
 Male A will tack on three chucks.\
 (line 10) Back and forth they go, call and raise, until the frogs hit their respiratory limit at six\
 to seven rapid-fire chucks.\
 The acoustic one-upfrogship is energetically draining and risks attracting predators like\
 bats. Yet the male frogs have no choice but to keep count of the competition, for the simple\
 reason that female túngaras are doing the same: listening, counting and ultimately mating\
 (line 15) with the male of maximum chucks.\
 Behind the frog’s surprisingly sophisticated number sense, scientists have found, are\
 specialized cells in the amphibian midbrain that tally up sound signals and the intervals\
 between them.\
 \"The neurons are counting the number of appropriate pulses, and they’re highly\
 (line 20) selective,\" said Gary Rose, a biologist at the University of Utah. If the timing between\
 pulses is off by just a fraction of a second, the neurons don’t fire and the counting process\
 breaks down. …\
 Scientists have found that animals across the evolutionary spectrum have a keen sense\
 of quantity, able to distinguish not just bigger from smaller or more from less, but two from\
 (line 25) four, four from ten, forty from sixty.\
 Orb-weaving spiders, for example, keep a tally of how many silk-wrapped prey items are\
 stashed in the \"larder\" segment of their web. When scientists experimentally remove the\
 cache, the spiders will spend time searching for the stolen goods in proportion to how many\
 separate items had been taken, rather than how big the total prey mass might have been.\
 (line 30) Small fish benefit from living in schools, and the more numerous the group, the\
 statistically better a fish’s odds of escaping predation. As a result, many shoaling (shoaling - shallow water) fish are\
 excellent appraisers of relative head counts.\
 Guppies, for example, have a so-called contrast ratio of .8, which means they can\
 distinguish at a glance between four guppies and five, or eight guppies and ten, and if given\
 (line 35) the chance will swim toward the slightly fishier crowd.\
 Three-spined sticklebacks (sticklebacks - carnivorous fish) are more discriminating still: with a contrast ratio of .86,\
 they’re able to tell six fellow fish from seven, or 18 from 21 — a comparative power that\
 many birds, mammals and even humans might find hard to beat.\
 Despite the prevalence of math phobia, people too are born with a strong innate\
 (line 40) number sense, and numerosity is deeply embedded in many aspects of our minds and\
 culture.\
 Researchers have determined that number words for small quantities — less than five —\
 are strikingly similar across virtually every language studied, and the words are among the\
 most stable, unchanging utterances in any lexicon. (lexicon - language)\
 (line 45) They are more conserved through time and across cultures than words for other\
 presumably bedrock concepts like mother, father and most body parts, with a few puzzling\
 exceptions like the words for tongue and eye.\
 \"The sounds that you and I use to say ‘two’ or ‘three’ are the sounds that have been used\
 for tens of thousands of years,\" said Mark Pagel, a biologist who studies the evolution of\
 (line 50) language at the University of Reading.\
 \"It’s not out of the question that you could have been wandering around 15,000 years\
 ago and encountered a few of the last remaining Neanderthals, pointed to yourself and said,\
 ‘one,’ and pointed to them and said, ‘three,’ and those words, in an odd, coarse way, would\
 have been understood.\"\
 (line 55) That continuity, Dr. Pagel added, \"should astonish us.\" …\
 Attitudes about animal numerosity have changed dramatically since the mid-twentieth\
 century when many researchers believed only humans had enough gray matter to think\
 quantitatively. They cited as an object lesson the 1907 case of Clever Hans, the horse that\
 supposedly could solve arithmetic problems and would tap out his answers by hoof; as it\
 (line 60) turned out, he was responding to unconscious cues from the people around him.\
 Since then, researchers have approached the field with caution and rigor, seeking to\
 identify the specific evolutionary pressures that might spur the need for numeric judgments\
 in any given species.\
 Social carnivores like spotted hyenas, for example, live in fission-fusion societies, (fission-fusion societies - animals whose social group composition and size change as they move throughout their environment)\
 (line 65) collectively defending their territories against rivals but in ever-shifting groups of widely\
 roaming members. \"You can never predict who you’ll find in which group,\" said Sarah\
 Benson-Amram, an assistant professor of zoology and physiology at the University of\
 Wyoming. \"You might be alone or in a group of ten.\"\
 Because hyena jaws can pulverize zebra bones, encounters between [rival hyena]\
 (line 70) competitors can prove deadly; every spotted hyena must have a good sense from moment\
 to moment of how many there are of us versus how many of them. Dr. Benson-Amram and\
 her colleagues tested hyena numerosity skills in the field, playing back the recorded whoops\
 of spotted hyenas living in South Africa and Namibia to hyenas in Kenya.\
 The Kenyan carnivores reacted to the whoops of strangers as predicted, approaching\
 (line 75)\
 the hidden source of the sound when they had a home team advantage, retreating when\
 they heard a few too many distinctive voices in a row. Or sometimes, when the local hyenas\
 were outnumbered, they’d call for backup. …\
 Chimpanzees are social scorekeepers, episodic (episodic - periodic) warriors and number ninjas, too.\
 They can be taught to associate groups of objects with corresponding Arabic numerals up\
 (line 80) to the number 9 and sometimes beyond — three squares on a computer screen with the\
 number 3, five squares with 5, and so on. They can put those numerals in order.\
 The numeric working memory of young chimpanzees is astonishing: Flash a random\
 scattering of numerals on a screen for just 210 milliseconds — half an eye blink — and then\
 cover the numbers with white squares, and a numerically schooled young chimpanzee will\
 (line 85) touch the squares sequentially to indicate the ascending order of the numbers hidden\
 beneath.\
 Don’t bother trying to do this yourself, Tetsuro Matsuzawa, a primatologist at Kyoto\
 University, said at the scientific meeting in London on which the themed journal (the themed journal - a publication where animal numerosity studies were discussed) was based.\
 \"You can’t.\" …\
 (line 90) Stanislas Dehaene, a psychologist at the University of Paris, and his colleagues\
 presented evidence from brain scans of professional mathematicians that the neural\
 circuitry (neural circuitry - nerve cells) for advanced mathematical thinking is an elaboration on the archaic (archaic - primitive) number sense\
 we share with other animals. …\
 We hear that the price of something rose by 50 percent and then fell by 50 percent, and\
 (line 95) we reflexively, mistakenly conclude, \"Oh good, we’re back to where we started.\" Our natural\
 number sense adds and subtracts whole numbers, whole chucks, guppies and hyenas.\
 But it really abhors a fraction, and so has led us astray.\

 Reading Comprehension Passage A\
 \
 The Count and the Wedding Guest\
 \
    Miss Maggie Conway and Mr. Andy Donovan are staying at the same boarding house in New York City.\
 \
    …Just coming out the door was Miss Conway. She wore a night-black dress of\
 crêpe de—crêpe de—oh, this thin black goods.(goods - fabric) Her hat was black, and from it drooped and\
 fluttered an ebon veil, filmy as a spider’s web. She stood on the top step and drew on black\
 silk gloves. Not a speck of white or a spot of color about her dress anywhere. Her rich\
 (line 5) golden hair was drawn, with scarcely a ripple, into a shining, smooth knot low on her neck.\
 Her face was plain rather than pretty, but it was now illuminated and made almost beautiful\
 by her large gray eyes that gazed above the houses across the street into the sky with an\
 expression of the most appealing sadness and melancholy. …\
    “It’s a fine, clear evening, Miss Conway,” he [Andy Donovan] said; and if the Weather\
 (line 10) Bureau could have heard the confident emphasis of his tones it would have hoisted the\
 square white signal, (square white signal - a sign of good weather) and nailed it to the mast.\
    “To them that has the heart to enjoy it, it is, Mr. Donovan,” said Miss Conway, with\
 a sigh. …\
    “I hope none of your relatives—I hope you haven’t sustained a loss?” ventured\
 (line 15) Mr. Donovan.\
    “Death has claimed,” said Miss Conway, hesitating—“not a relative, but one who—but\
 I will not intrude my grief upon you, Mr. Donovan.”\
    “Intrude?” protested Mr. Donovan. “Why, say, Miss Conway, I’d be delighted, that is,\
 I’d be sorry—I mean I’m sure nobody could sympathize with you truer than I would.”\
 (line 20)   Miss Conway smiled a little smile. And oh, it was sadder than her expression in repose. (repose - at rest) …\
    “It’s tough to be alone in New York—that’s a cinch,” said Mr. Donovan. “But, say—\
 whenever this little old town does loosen up and get friendly it goes the limit. Say you took\
 a little stroll in the park, Miss Conway—don’t you think it might chase away some of your\
 mullygrubs? And if you’d allow me—”\
 (line 25)   “Thanks, Mr. Donovan. I’d be pleased to accept of your escort if you think the company\
 of one whose heart is filled with gloom could be anyways agreeable to you.”\
    Through the open gates of the iron-railed, old, downtown park, where the elect once\
 took the air, they strolled, and found a quiet bench. …\
    “He was my fiancé,” confided Miss Conway, at the end of an hour. “We were going to\
 (line 30) be married next spring. I don’t want you to think that I am stringing you, Mr. Donovan, but\
 he was a real Count. He had an estate and a castle in Italy. Count Fernando Mazzini was\
 his name. I never saw the beat of him for elegance. Papa objected, of course, and once \
 we eloped, but papa overtook us, and took us back. I thought sure papa and Fernando \
 would fight a duel. Papa has a livery business—in P’kipsee [Poughkeepsie], you know.” … \
 (line 35)    “Three days ago I got a letter from Italy, forwarded from P’kipsee, saying that Fernando \
 had been killed in a gondola accident.” … \
    “I’ve got his picture here in my locket,” said Miss Conway, after wiping her eyes with \
 her handkerchief. “I never showed it to anybody; but I will to you, Mr. Donovan, because \
 I believe you to be a true friend.” \
 (line 40)   Mr. Donovan gazed long and with much interest at the photograph in the locket that \
 Miss Conway opened for him. The face of Count Mazzini was one to command interest. \
 It was a smooth, intelligent, bright, almost a handsome face—the face of a strong, cheerful \
 man who might well be a leader among his fellows. \
    “I have a larger one, framed, in my room,” said Miss Conway. “When we return I will\
 (line 45) show you that. They are all I have to remind me of Fernando. But he ever will be present \
 in my heart, that’s a sure thing.” \
    A subtle task confronted Mr. Donovan,—that of supplanting (supplanting - replacing) the unfortunate Count in \
 the heart of Miss Conway. This his admiration for her determined him to do. But the \
 magnitude of the undertaking did not seem to weigh upon his spirits. The sympathetic but\
 (line 50) cheerful friend was the role he essayed; (essayed - attempted) and he played it so successfully that the next \
 half-hour found them conversing pensively across two plates of ice-cream, though yet there \
 was no diminution of the sadness in Miss Conway’s large gray eyes. \
    Before they parted in the hall that evening she ran upstairs and brought down the \
 framed photograph wrapped lovingly in a white silk scarf. Mr. Donovan surveyed it with\
 (line 55) inscrutable (inscrutable - unreadable) eyes. … \
    “A fine-looking man,” said Mr. Donovan, heartily. “How would it suit you, Miss Conway, \
 to give me the pleasure of your company to Coney [Island] next Sunday afternoon?” \
    A month later they announced their engagement to Mrs. Scott and the other boarders. \
 Miss Conway continued to wear black.\
 (line 60)   A week after the announcement the two sat on the same bench in the downtown park, \
 while the fluttering leaves of the trees made a dim kinetoscopic (kinetoscopic - flickering) picture of them in the \
 moonlight. But Donovan had worn a look of abstracted gloom all day. He was so silent \
 to-night that love’s lips could not keep back any longer the questions that love’s heart \
 propounded. (propounded - put forward)\
 (line 65)   “What’s the matter, Andy, you are so solemn and grouchy to-night?”\
    “Nothing, Maggie.”\
    “I know better. Can’t I tell? You never acted this way before. What is it?” … \
    “I’ll tell you then,” said Andy, wisely, “but I guess you won’t understand it exactly. \
 You’ve heard of Mike Sullivan, haven’t you? ‘Big Mike’ Sullivan, everybody calls him.”\
 (line 70)   “No, I haven’t,” said Maggie. “And I don’t want to, if he makes you act like this. Who is \
 he?” …\
    “Well, Big Mike’s a friend of mine. I ain’t more than deuce-high in the district as far as \
 influence goes, but Mike’s as good a friend to a little man, or a poor man as he is to a big \
 one. I met him to-day on the Bowery [Street], and what do you think he does? Comes up\
 (line 75) and shakes hands. ‘Andy,’ says he, ‘I’ve been keeping cases on you. You’ve been putting in \
 some good licks over on your side of the street, and I’m proud of you. What’ll you take to \
 drink?’ He takes a cigar, and I take a highball. I told him I was going to get married in two \
 weeks. ‘Andy,’ says he, ‘send me an invitation, so I’ll keep in mind of it, and I’ll come to the \
 wedding.’ That’s what Big Mike says to me; and he always does what he says. \
 (line 80)   “You don’t understand it, Maggie, but I’d have one of my hands cut off to have Big Mike \
 Sullivan at our wedding. It would be the proudest day of my life. When he goes to a man’s \
 wedding, there’s a guy being married that’s made for life. Now, that’s why I’m maybe looking \
 sore to-night.”\
    “Why don’t you invite him, then, if he’s so much to the mustard?” (to the mustard - successful) said Maggie, lightly. …\
 (line 85)   “Maggie,” said Andy, presently, “do you think as much of me as you did of your—as you \
 did of the Count Mazzini?”\
    He waited a long time, but Maggie did not reply. And then, suddenly she leaned against \
 his shoulder and began to cry—to cry and shake with sobs, holding his arm tightly, and \
 wetting the crêpe de Chine with tears. …\
 (line 90)   But instead of being pushed away, she found Andy’s arm folding her closer. She looked \
 up and saw his face cleared and smiling. …\
    “Andy,” said Maggie, with a somewhat shy smile, after she had been thoroughly assured \
 of forgiveness, “did you believe all that story about the Count?” \
    “Well, not to any large extent,” said Andy, reaching for his cigar case, “because it’s\
 (line 95) Big Mike Sullivan’s picture you’ve got in that locket of yours.” \

Reading Comprehension Passage C\
 \
 …Nowhere is light pollution more apparent, almost achingly so, than in satellite images\
 of the Earth from space. The continental United States seems to split in half: the eastern\
 side is brighter than the west, except for the klieg lights of Las Vegas. Highways innervate (innervate - energize)\
 America, connecting luminous dots of small towns and big cities. Across the Atlantic,\
 (line 5) Europe shimmers. Moscow is a radiant nine-pointed star. The Nile Delta glows like a\
 dandelion sprouting from mostly indigo Africa. Farther east, Hong Kong and Shanghai are\
 ablaze, and the demilitarised zone separates dark North Korea from South Korea more\
 cleanly than if the peninsula had been cleft in two. Developed society, it’s clear, is where the\
 light is.\
 \
 (line 10) Human-controlled light has pierced the night for thousands of years, long before\
 [Thomas] Edison. Campfires warmed our ancestors’ feet and cooked their meals; the\
 Harvard anthropologist Richard Wrangham argues in his book Catching Fire (2009) that\
 gathering around a flame to eat and to commune with others is, in fact, what made us\
 human. Not just fellowship but safety has long been the primary rationale for pushing back\
 (line 15) the night. ‘Evil spirits love not the smell of lamps,’ as Plato put it. Comforting, lambent (lambent — glowing or flickering with a soft radiance) \
 lamplight led us safely home by tattling on the people and potholes and animals that would\
 otherwise do us harm. By the early 17th century, residents of cities such as Paris and London\
 were admonished (admonished — warned) to keep lights burning in the windows of all houses that faced the streets,\
 as the historian A. Roger Ekirch notes in his book At Day’s Close: Night in Times Past\
 (line 20) (2005). Taxpayers funded oil lamps and candlelit lanterns for the avenues, while only\
 genteel households could afford fine beeswax or spermaceti candles; most people relied on\
 tallow, made from animal fat. …\
 \
 And even so — what price safety! A young but rapidly growing field of research suggests\
 that night-time light itself is far more dangerous than the dark. In a 2012 report, an\
 (line 25) American Medical Association committee called electric lighting a ‘man-made self-\
 experiment’ creating potentially harmful health effects. Humans, and everything else that\
 lives on this planet with us, evolved during billions of years along a reliable cycle of day and\
 night, with clear boundaries between them. Staunching the flood of artificial light can help\
 restore this divide. Our well-being, and that of our fellow creatures, might depend on us\
 (line 30) doing so — or at the very least trying. The loss of night-time darkness neglects our shared\
 past, but it might very well cut short our futures too. …\
 \
 A growing body of evidence shows that light pollution exacerbates (exacerbates — makes a situation worse),  and might directly\
 cause, cancer, obesity, and depression, the troublesome triumvirate (triumvirate — a group of three holding power) of industrialised\
 society. One of the first people to notice this correlation, at least as it applies to cancer, is\
 (line 35) Richard Stevens, a professor at the University of Connecticut, respected cancer\
 epidemiologist (epidemiologist — health professional who investigates patterns and causes of diseases), and mild insomniac. In the early 1980s, Stevens and other researchers\
 were beginning to realise there was little or no connection between diet and rising rates \
 breast cancer, contrary to what had been suspected. As Stevens puts it, it was like a light\
 bulb going on when he realised that, in fact, a light bulb going on might be a culprit. …\
 \
 (line 40) ‘Rather than falling, night, to the watchful eye, rises,’ writes Ekirch in At Day’s Close.\
 Shadows creep up lows and valleys first, then consume hillsides and houses and the tallest\
 buildings. Muted greys and deeper blues chase off the sun until finally the sky leaks no\
 colour. When we sleep according to a solar cycle, melatonin (melantonin - hormone that regulates sleep and wakefulness) production follows this\
 pattern, rising with the night. But artificial light tamps it down. This is frustratingly\
 (line 45) apparent for a special class of humans who experience sunsets every 90 minutes: astronauts.\
 \
 One of the most frequent complaints of orbital crew members is insomnia; they pop\
 sleeping pills on a regular basis, and still get only about six hours of shuteye, though they’re\
 allotted eight. Steven W. Lockley, a Harvard neuroscientist, recommends altering the light\
 to improve matters. In 2012, he advised NASA [National Aeronautics and Space\
 (line 50) Administration] engineers to change the light bulbs on the International Space Station to a\
 type of LED that can display blue-shifted light during the ‘day’, when the crew is working,\
 and red-shifted light when they need to rest. Why the difference? That crucial ganglion (ganglion — mass of nerve tissues in the brain),\
 the circadian (circadian — 24-hour biological cycle) photoreceptor, is particularly sensitive to light toward the bluish end of the\
 red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo and violet visible-light spectrum. …\
 \
 (line 55) Insomnia is hardly the worst side effect of light pollution. Shift workers, who rise with\
 the night and work awash in blue light, experience not only disrupted circadian rhythms and\
 sleep deprivation, but an increased risk of breast and prostate cancer. These cancers, which\
 require hormones to grow, are suppressed in the presence of melatonin, Stevens has shown.\
 In 2010, Stevens published a review of breast cancer sensitivity in 164 countries, and found\
 (line 60) a 30 to 50 per cent increased risk of cancer in nations with the worst light pollution, but no\
 increased prevalence of non-hormonally dependent cancers in the same populations.\
 \
 ‘Our use of electric light in the modern world is disrupting our circadian sleep and our\
 biology. There is no question about that. Does that have physiological consequences? There\
 is more and more evidence that it does,’ Stevens told me. ‘The epidemiological studies are\
 (line 65) the crudest, but the most important.’ …\
 \
 When we, in the industrialised world, do manage to turn off the lights, there are\
 measurable, beneficial effects on our circadian rhythms. In a widely reported paper last\
 summer, Kenneth Wright at the University of Colorado at Boulder took eight students\
 camping in the Rocky Mountains for two weeks. They weren’t allowed to use any artificial\
 (line 70) light after the sun went down — only the sanguine (sanguine — red) glow of campfire. After a week,\
 melatonin started to rise at sunset, peak in the middle of the night, and taper just at sunrise,\
 which Wright called a ‘remarkable’ result. ‘Internal biological time under natural light-dark\
 conditions tightly synchronises to environmental time, and in this regard, humans are\
 comparable to other animals,’ he wrote. …\
 \
 (line 75) For those of us addicted to our glowing phones and tablets, an app called F.lux can help.\
 It ‘warms’ your device’s display screen so that it shifts red in the evening, more closely\
 matching incandescent bulbs and the hue of the setting sun. Just a brief glimpse at your\
 mobile phone at bedtime is enough to expose your retinas to artificial light, so fighting such\
 a comprehensive intrusion might be an exercise in futility. But even if we can’t completely\
 (line 80) quench our thirst for light, we can all make one small gesture, which could prompt us to\
 unplug a little more. …\

 …Lives were indeed about to be sacrificed for the sake of the hat. As for the veiling of women, it was officially discouraged, but not banned. In any case, veiling had been largely a middle-class custom, and the middle classes discarded it. The generality of women wore long headscarves, which they drew across their faces in the presence of male strangers. The government of the republic banned headscarves in official premises, including schools, under civil service regulations. Elsewhere they were tolerated and they have remained a feature of the Turkish scene to this day, while the ban on women’s headscarves in official premises is challenged every time that official pressure is relaxed.…\

 French Colonization of Vietnam\
 \
 . . Economic development always involved what benefited France and her French colonists, not the Vietnamese. Vietnam was kept as dependent on the mother country as possible, both as a source of raw materials and as a captive market for French manufactured goods. Customs regulations were designed to promote French products and discourage competition from foreign goods, thus restricting the consumer in what he could buy.\
    A less shortsighted administration could have predicted the eventual outcome of these restrictive policies, but it took raw armed force to shock the French and the rest of the world into the realities of the situation. In a few words, the people were getting fed up. . .\

Excerpt from Wheels of Change: How Women Rode the Bicycle to Freedom (With a Few Flat Tires Along the Way)\
 by Sue Macy\
 \
 (paragraph 1) Women’s rights crusader Elizabeth Cady Stanton was in her eighties during the\
 heyday of the bicycle, and no evidence exists to show that she actually ever rode one.\
 But there was no better or more eloquent advocate for women and the wheel. In 1895,\
 Stanton contributed an article to the American Wheelman celebrating this “wonderful\
 new style of locomotion.” In the article, titled “The Era of the Bicycle,” she pointed out\
 that cycling was increasing people’s mobility, eliminating the cost of feeding and\
 housing horses, and encouraging the building of good roads. However, she saved her\
 greatest praise for the bicycle’s effects on women. “The bicycle,” she wrote, “will inspire\
 women with more courage, self-respect and self-reliance and make the next generation\
 more vigorous of mind and of body; for feeble mothers do not produce great\
 statesmen, scientists and scholars.”\
 (paragraph 2) For all the practical benefits of the two-wheeler, the fact is that it brought about a\
 cosmic shift in women’s private and public lives. With the rise of industry and the\
 move from a rural to an urban economy in the 19th century, American women had\
 become increasingly confined to their homes. Young girls could play outside, but when\
 they matured, their freedom of movement was greatly restricted. “At sixteen years of\
 age, I was enwrapped in the long skirts that impeded every footstep,” remembered\
 Frances Willard, who in 1895 wrote a best-selling account of how she learned to ride a\
 bicycle at age 53. “I have detested walking and felt with a certain noble disdain that the\
 conventions of life had cut me off from what . . . had been one of life’s sweetest joys.”\
 (paragraph 3) While wealthier women were saddled with long skirts and restrictive corsets, those\
 who were less well off worked anonymously in mills and factories. All in all, the result\
 was the same. Except in a few instances, the public image of America was male.\
 Politicians, soldiers, business leaders, and even the leading athletes in the new sports of\
 baseball and football were all men. But the bicycle changed that. Suddenly, women\
 were leaving their homes to cycle and socialize on country roads and city streets.\
 Bicycle racers such as Louise Armaindo and Frankie Nelson had their exploits splashed\
 all over the papers. Bicycle manufacturers, intent on mining an untapped market,\
 showed female models in their advertisements. Thanks to the wheel, women were\
 starting to be seen and heard in public life.\
 (paragraph 4) It was not a stretch for some cyclists to see the possibility of a larger role for women\
 in the world. When she conquered the wheel, Frances Willard was a former university\
 president and the longtime president of the Woman’s Christian Temperance Union,\
 which fought to prohibit the use of alcoholic beverages and to win women the right to\
 vote. Willard saw parallels between learning to ride and learning to live. “I began to feel\
 that myself plus the bicycle equaled myself plus the world, upon whose spinning wheel\
 we must all learn to ride,” she wrote. “He who succeeds, or, to be more exact in handing\
 over my experience, she who succeeds in gaining the mastery of [a bicycle], will gain\
 the mastery of life.”\
 (paragraph 5) For decades, Willard, along with Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Susan B. Anthony, and\
 many others, had been working toward increased political and economic rights for\
 women. Now the bicycle brought a taste of independence to women on a very personal\
 level, and some of them took the opportunity to express their discontent with old\
 traditions and expectations. In August 1895, a cyclist named Ann Strong caused a stir\
 when she compared the value of a bicycle to that of a husband in the Minneapolis\
 Tribune. “I can’t see but that a wheel is just as good company as most husbands,” she\
 declared. “I would as lief (lief: happily) talk to one inanimate object as another; and I’d a great deal\
 rather talk to one that can’t answer than one that won’t.” Strong then contrasted the joy\
 of cycling with the challenges of raising a family. “You can make your wheel tidy over\
 night,” she said, “and it never kicks off its shoes the very last minute, and never smears\
 itself with molasses. When you are ready you can start. No little elbows are stuck in\
 your ribs; there is no wiggling; screams at the cars or at the candy stores. You glide\
 along, silently, smoothly, swiftly.”\
 (paragraph 6) Some stated the liberating effects of the bicycle with less sarcasm. “The bicycle has\
 brought to women a healthful, wholesome means of securing a degree of freedom and\
 independence that no amount of discussion regarding ‘women’s rights’ would ever\
 have produced,” wrote the L.A.W. Bulletin and Good Roads magazine in 1898.\
 Meanwhile, Munsey’s Magazine assessed the impact of the wheel on women in a\
 special bicycle-themed issue. “If she has ridden her bicycle into new fields, becoming in\
 the process a new creature, it has been gradually and unconsciously,” the editors wrote.\
 (paragraph 7) “She did not have to be born again in some mysterious fashion, becoming a strange\
 creature, a ‘new woman.’ She is more like the ‘eternal feminine,’ who has taken on\
 wings, and who is using them with an ever increasing delight in her new power.”\
 Indeed, many bicycle companies at home and abroad did put wings on the women in\
 their advertisements, emphasizing that they had taken flight.\
 (paragraph 8) Not all publications treated the emergence of the “new woman” with the same level\
 of approval. Some mocked her, while others just seemed baffled by her. Her new way of\
 dressing, in bloomers or divided skirts or skirts with shortened hems, certainly\
 disturbed the old social order, but so did her confidence and daring. These traits led\
 commentators to worry that the differences between the sexes were being blurred, a\
 fear that was reinforced as the four newest states—Wyoming, Colorado, Utah, and\
 Idaho—granted women the right to vote in the 1890s. Would the bicycle help bring\
 about a new kind of equality between men and women? Elizabeth Cady Stanton and\
 her colleagues certainly hoped so. At any rate, the image of a female cyclist quickly\
 became associated with efforts to win more rights for women.\
What do the details in paragraph 3 reveal about the author’s point of view?\
(A) The author thinks that clothing restrictions were less of a burden than the necessity of hard work.\
 (B) The author thinks that all women were treated unfairly regardless of economic status.\
 (C) The author thinks that poor women had more freedom of dress even though they had to work hard.\
 (D) The author thinks that the contrast between two classes of women had an effect on their advancement.\

 NAFTA [North American Free Trade Agreement] has led to an increase in the workforce, as foreign industry has grown. They are reforming labor laws and our constitution to favor even more foreign investment, which is unfair against our labor rights. For example, they are now trying to take away from us free organization which was guaranteed by Mexican law. Because foreign capital is investing in Mexico and is dominating, we must have guarantees. The government is just there with its hands held out; it’s always had them out but now even more shamelessly. . . . Ecological problems are increasing. A majority of women are coming down with cancer — skin and breast cancer, leukemia, and lung and heart problems. There are daily deaths of worker women. You can see and feel the contamination of the water and the air. As soon as you arrive and start breathing the air in Acuña and Piedras Negras [border cities between the states of Coahuila and Texas], you sense the heavy air, making you feel like vomiting. . . .\

    The sankin kōtai (lit., “alternate attendance”) system was a device of the Tokugawa shogunate, the government of Japan from 1603 to 1868, designed to insure political control by the regime over the daimyo, or territorial lords, who exercised virtually autonomous authority over the more than 260 feudal states into which four-fifths of the country was divided. Under this system most of the daimyo were required to travel biennially [every two years] from their domains to the capital of the Tokugawa at Edo (present day Tokyo) and to spend alternate years in personal attendance at the shogunal court. Each daimyo was also required to maintain residences at the capital where his wife and children were permanently detained. . . .\
    Another important contribution of the operation of the sankin kōtai system to the modernization of Japan was to promote the intellectual and cultural unification of the country. The sankin kōtai served to bring a large part of the leadership elements from the whole country together in one place and to keep a constant stream of leaders and intellectuals moving back and forth between the capital and all parts of the country. This was important in giving Japan the tremendous intellectual unity with which it faced the West in the nineteenth century. It also enabled the people at large to have a stronger sense of national unity than would have been the case had the system not existed. By serving as the vehicle which spread the culture of Edo and Osaka to the countryside, the system influenced the diffusion of a truly national culture. . . .\

 I’ve hunched so long above this puzzle\
 laid out on my gouged and ink-stained workbench,\
 I think, at last, it’s unsolvable,\
 that the only meaning it holds is told\
 (line 5) in the moments I feel on the verge\
 of understanding, and it turns me back.\
 \
 The pieces: so small, so many. How they\
 belong together is beyond me,\
 though early on my mind inclined\
 (line 10) toward an idyllic scene: a yellow field,\
 all jonquils (jonquils - a type of yellow daffodil), a sea, the wide horizon…\
 \
 The dog’s dish is empty. My wife and children\
 sleep. The house is hushed, except\
 for the stout hall clock that ticks its minutes.\
 (line 15) Here in my patch of lamplight, time\
 dawdles, waiting for me to catch up,\
 though a few small hairs on my wrist\
 have gone white, and evening’s blank encircles me.\
 \
 Who made this puzzle? If I sought him out\
 (line 20) would he hear my plea and reveal its logic?\
 But the hour is late, my vision strained.\
 How could I look for him now, though he were\
 waiting for me, and knew me by name?\

One group was watered with water having a pH of 3.0, and the other group was watered with water having a pH of 7.0. Both groups of plants received the same amount and intensity of light, the same amount of water, and they were grown in the same type of soil. The heights of the radish plants were measured every 2 days for a period of 2 weeks.\

Excerpt from Wheels of Change: How Women Rode the Bicycle to Freedom (With a Few Flat Tires Along the Way)\
 \
 by Sue Macy\
 \
 (paragraph 1) Women’s rights crusader Elizabeth Cady Stanton was in her eighties during the heyday of the bicycle, and no evidence exists to show that she actually ever rode one. But there was no better or more eloquent advocate for women and the wheel. In 1895, Stanton contributed an article to the American Wheelman celebrating this “wonderful new style of locomotion.” In the article, titled “The Era of the Bicycle,” she pointed out that cycling was increasing people’s mobility, eliminating the cost of feeding and housing horses, and encouraging the building of good roads. However, she saved her greatest praise for the bicycle’s effects on women. “The bicycle,” she wrote, “will inspire women with more courage, self-respect and self-reliance and make the next generation more vigorous of mind and of body; for feeble mothers do not produce great statesmen, scientists and scholars.”\
 \
 (paragraph 2) For all the practical benefits of the two-wheeler, the fact is that it brought about a cosmic shift in women’s private and public lives. With the rise of industry and the move from a rural to an urban economy in the 19th century, American women had become increasingly confined to their homes. Young girls could play outside, but when they matured, their freedom of movement was greatly restricted. “At sixteen years of age, I was enwrapped in the long skirts that impeded every footstep,” remembered Frances Willard, who in 1895 wrote a best-selling account of how she learned to ride abicycle at age 53. “I have detested walking and felt with a certain noble disdain that the conventions of life had cut me off from what . . . had been one of life’s sweetest joys.”\
 \
 (paragraph 3) While wealthier women were saddled with long skirts and restrictive corsets, those who were less well off worked anonymously in mills and factories. All in all, the result was the same. Except in a few instances, the public image of America was male. Politicians, soldiers, business leaders, and even the leading athletes in the new sports of baseball and football were all men. But the bicycle changed that. Suddenly, women were leaving their homes to cycle and socialize on country roads and city streets. Bicycle racers such as Louise Armaindo and Frankie Nelson had their exploits splashed all over the papers. Bicycle manufacturers, intent on mining an untapped market, showed female models in their advertisements. Thanks to the wheel, women were starting to be seen and heard in public life.\
 \
 (paragraph 4) It was not a stretch for some cyclists to see the possibility of a larger role for women in the world. When she conquered the wheel, Frances Willard was a former university president and the longtime president of the Woman’s Christian Temperance Union, which fought to prohibit the use of alcoholic beverages and to win women the right to vote. Willard saw parallels between learning to ride and learning to live. “I began to feel that myself plus the bicycle equaled myself plus the world, upon whose spinning wheel we must all learn to ride,” she wrote. “He who succeeds, or, to be more exact in handing over my experience, she who succeeds in gaining the mastery of [a bicycle], will gain the mastery of life.”\
 \
 (paragraph 5) For decades, Willard, along with Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Susan B. Anthony, and many others, had been working toward increased political and economic rights for women. Now the bicycle brought a taste of independence to women on a very personal level, and some of them took the opportunity to express their discontent with old traditions and expectations. In August 1895, a cyclist named Ann Strong caused a stir when she compared the value of a bicycle to that of a husband in the Minneapolis Tribune. “I can’t see but that a wheel is just as good company as most husbands,” she declared. “I would as lief (lief - happily) talk to one inanimate object as another; and I’d a great deal rather talk to one that can’t answer than one that won’t.” Strong then contrasted the joy of cycling with the challenges of raising a family. “You can make your wheel tidy over night,” she said, “and it never kicks off its shoes the very last minute, and never smears itself with molasses. When you are ready you can start. No little elbows are stuck in your ribs; there is no wiggling; screams at the cars or at the candy stores. You glide along, silently, smoothly, swiftly.”\
 \
 (paragraph 6) Some stated the liberating effects of the bicycle with less sarcasm. “The bicycle has brought to women a healthful, wholesome means of securing a degree of freedom and independence that no amount of discussion regarding ‘women’s rights’ would ever have produced,” wrote the L.A.W. Bulletin and Good Roads magazine in 1898. Meanwhile, Munsey’s Magazine assessed the impact of the wheel on women in a special bicycle-themed issue. “If she has ridden her bicycle into new fields, becoming in the process a new creature, it has been gradually and unconsciously,” the editors wrote.\
 \
 (paragraph 7) “She did not have to be born again in some mysterious fashion, becoming a strange creature, a ‘new woman.’ She is more like the ‘eternal feminine,’ who has taken on wings, and who is using them with an ever increasing delight in her new power.” Indeed, many bicycle companies at home and abroad did put wings on the women in their advertisements, emphasizing that they had taken flight.\
 \
 (paragraph 8) Not all publications treated the emergence of the “new woman” with the same level of approval. Some mocked her, while others just seemed baffled by her. Her new way of dressing, in bloomers or divided skirts or skirts with shortened hems, certainly disturbed the old social order, but so did her confidence and daring. These traits led commentators to worry that the differences between the sexes were being blurred, a fear that was reinforced as the four newest states—Wyoming, Colorado, Utah, and Idaho—granted women the right to vote in the 1890s. Would the bicycle help bring about a new kind of equality between men and women? Elizabeth Cady Stanton and her colleagues certainly hoped so. At any rate, the image of a female cyclist quickly became associated with efforts to win more rights for women.\

Excerpt from A la Carte\
 by Tanita S. Davis\
 \
 (paragraph 1) “Homework?” My mother mouths the word exaggeratedly, eyebrows raised, and I\
 roll my eyes. Frowning, she points with her chin to the side door that leads to the stairs.\
 I roll my eyes again, mouthing, Okay, okay, not needing her to pantomime further what\
 she wants me to do. I hate the thought of leaving the clattering nerve center of the\
 restaurant to wrestle with my trigonometry homework in my mother’s quiet office\
 downstairs.\
 (paragraph 2) \"Order!\"\
 (paragraph 3) The bright lights and swirl of noise and motion are muffled as the kitchen door\
 swings closed behind me.\
 (paragraph 4) It’s hard to remember a time when the restaurant hasn’t been the center of our lives.\
 Mom used to be a copy editor and wrote food features for our local paper, the Clarion,\
 and she met Pia when she did a write-up on the culinary school Pia attended. Pia\
 thinks it was fate that Mom wanted to invest in a restaurant at the same time Pia\
 wanted to buy the old bank building.\
 (paragraph 5) La Salle Rouge doesn’t serve much in the way of “kid” food, since the menu doesn’t\
 cater to people my age on a cheap date, but I’ve loved everything about it from the first.\
 I started experimenting with being a vegetarian when I turned fourteen, but Pia still\
 found things to feed me and taught me to be creative with vegetables and tofu. I like to\
 think I’m the best-fed vegetarian in the state of California.\
 (paragraph 6) Pia’s been really good about teaching what she knows, and I decided early on that\
 this is the work I want to do—get out of school and get into the kitchen for good. Mom\
 and Pia have created a popular French-Asian-Californian fusion restaurant that has\
 gotten great reviews from food critics. They took the best of each other’s tastes—\
 Mom’s traditional Southern flavors and Pia’s French training combined with her\
 vegetable- and spice-savvy Cambodian tastes—and pulled off what one food critic\
 called “stylized food with unique flavor combinations in an intimate setting.”\
 (paragraph 7) Whatever that means.\
 (paragraph 8) Three years ago, when I started high school thirty pounds heavier than everyone in\
 my class, Mom and I came up with a light menu for La Salle Rouge, and it’s been such a\
 popular idea that Mom lets me come up with tasty, low-calorie desserts, which is one of\
 my favorite things to do. It hardly seems fair that I have to walk away from all of that\
 just to do trigonometry, but my mom says I have to finish school before I concentrate\
 on cooking. She says it’s smarter to have a “backup plan,” and she’s made me apply to\
 plenty of colleges and check out business majors just in case I ever want to do anything\
 else with my life. I guess that makes sense if you’re anybody other than me. When I\
 turn eighteen, I already know what I’m going to do.\
 (paragraph 9) First, I’m going to buy a plane ticket to D.C. and go to Julia Child’s kitchen at the\
 Smithsonian and leave roses. They don’t let you walk through it, but somewhere—I\
 don’t know where—I’m going to leave a bouquet and a little note for her. Julia Child is\
 my patron saint (patron saint: an inspiring person admired for his or her work). She’s the queen of all reasons people can do anything they want in\
 life. Saint Julia didn’t start cooking until she was practically forty, and she went on to\
 do TV shows and make cookbooks and be this huge part of culinary history. She never\
 got too fancy, she never freaked out, and she was never afraid to try new things. I want\
 to be just like her—except maybe get famous faster.\
 (paragraph 10) The second thing I’m going to do is buy myself a set of knives. Pia swears by this set\
 of German steel knives she got when she graduated, but I’ve seen the TV chef Kylie\
 Kwong use a phenomenal-looking ceramic knife on her show on the Discovery\
 Channel. Either way, knives are what the best chefs have of their very own.\
 (paragraph 11) The third thing I’m going to do, after I get back from Washington and get my knives,\
 is . . . get discovered. Somehow. I know I’m going to have to pay my dues, but I’m so\
 ready for my real life to start. It’s not something I admit to a lot, but my real dream is to\
 be a celebrity chef. Do you know how many African American female chefs there\
 aren’t? And how many vegetarian chefs have their own shows? The field is wide open\
 for stardom. Every time I watch old episodes of Saint Julia, I imagine that I have my\
 own cooking show. The way celebrity chefs do it now, I could also have a line of\
 cooking gear, cookbooks, aprons, the works. People would know my name, ask for my\
 autograph, and try my recipes. All I have to do is finish my trig homework and get back\
 into the kitchen.\
Which sentence would be most important to include in a summary of the story?\
(A) When the narrator’s mother makes her do homework, the narrator rolls her eyes.\
 (B) When the narrator’s mother wanted to invest in a restaurant, Pia wanted to buy the old bank building.\
 (C) The narrator admires celebrity chefs.\
 (D) The narrator lives in California.\

This is the true story of a Kenyan woman named Wangari Maathai.\
 \
 Excerpt from Seeds of Change:\
 Planting a Path to Peace\
 \
 by Jen Cullerton Johnson\
 \
 (paragraph 1) “Come,” Wangari’s mother called. She beckoned her young daughter over to a tall tree with a wide, smooth trunk and a crown of green, oval leaves.\
 \
 (paragraph 2) “Feel,” her mother whispered.\
 \
 (paragraph 3) Wangari spread her small hands over the tree’s trunk. She smoothed her fingers over the rough bark.\
 \
 (paragraph 4) “This is the mugumo,” her mother said. “It is home to many. It feeds many too.”\
 \
 (paragraph 5) She snapped off a wild fig from a low branch, and gave it to her daughter. Wangari ate the delicious fruit, just as geckos and elephants did. High in the tree, birds chirped in their nests. The branches bounced with jumping monkeys.\
 \
 (paragraph 6) “Our people, the Kikuyu of Kenya, believe that our ancestors rest in the tree’s shade,” her mother explained.\
 \
 (paragraph 7) Wangari wrapped her arms around the trunk as if hugging her great-grandmother’s spirit. She promised never to cut down the tree. . . .\
 \
 ((paragraph 8) When Wangari finished elementary school, she was eleven years old. Her mind was like a seed rooted in rich soil, ready to grow. Wangari wanted to continue her education, but to do so she would have to leave her village and move to the capital city of Nairobi. Wangari had never been farther than her valley’s ridge. She was scared.\
 \
 (paragraph 9) “Go,” her mother said. She picked up a handful of earth and placed it gently into her daughter’s hand. “Where you go, we go.” . . .\
 \
 (paragraph 10) As graduation neared, Wangari told her friends she wanted to become a biologist.\
 \
 (paragraph 11) “Not many native women become biologists,” they told her.\
 \
 (paragraph 12) “I will,” she said.\
 \
 (paragraph 13) Wangari watched sadly as her government sold more and more land to big companies that cut down forests for timber and to clear land for coffee plantations. Native trees such as cedar and acacia vanished. Without trees, birds had no place to nest. Monkeys lost their swings. Tired mothers walked miles for firewood. . . .\
 \
 (paragraph 14) When Wangari visited her village she saw that the Kikuyu custom of not chopping down the mugumo trees had been lost. No longer held in place by tree roots, the soil streamed into the rivers. The water that had been used to grow maize, bananas, and sweet potatoes turned to mud and dried up. Many families went hungry.\
 \
 (paragraph 15) Wangari could not bear to think of the land being destroyed. Now married and the mother of three children, she worried about what would happen to the mothers and children who depended on the land.\
 \
 (paragraph 16) “We must do something,” Wangari said.\
 \
 (paragraph 17) Wangari had an idea as small as a seed but as tall as a tree that reaches for the sky. “Harabee! Let’s work together!” she said to her countrywomen—mothers like her. Wangari dug deep into the soil, a seedling by her side. “We must plant trees.” . . .\
 \
 (paragraph 18) Wangari traveled to villages, towns, and cities with saplings and seeds, shovels and hoes. At each place she went, women planted rows of trees that looked like green belts across the land. Because of this they started calling themselves the Green Belt Movement.\
 \
 (paragraph 19) “We might not change the big world but we can change the landscape of the forest,” she said.\
 \
 (paragraph 20) One tree turned to ten, ten to one hundred, one hundred to one million, all the way up to thirty million planted trees. Kenya grew green again. Birds nested in new trees. Monkeys swung on branches. Rivers filled with clean water. Wild figs grew heavy in mugumo branches.\
 \
 (paragraph 21) Mothers fed their children maize, bananas, and sweet potatoes until they could eat no more.\

 \
 Her mind was like a seed rooted in rich soil, ready to grow.\
 \

 Excerpt from Gregor and the Sheep\
 by Toby Rosenstrauch\
 \
 (paragraph 1) In a valley in the highlands of Scotland, there once lived a young tenant farmer, Gregor, and his widowed mother. Although they worked hard, they could never accumulate enough money to buy the flock of sheep they longed to have, for their small parcel of land produced only modest amounts of oats and barley. To make matters\
 worse, MacTavish, the owner of this and many other crofts, always found reasons not to pay the farmers all they had earned. . . .\
 \
 crofts = small farms\
 \
 (paragraph 2) When he opened the door each morning and looked out, he saw MacTavish’s house on top of a mountain, a magnificent stone mansion surrounded by red, pink, and violet rhododendrons. Gregor often climbed the slope and stood outside the iron gates, wondering what fine furnishings and delicious foods lay within. Neighbors claimed\
 that MacTavish owned many houses and even kept a chest of gems under his bed. As Gregor, his mother, and their neighbors grew gaunt and pale with hard work and not enough food, they railed against MacTavish, who had swindled all of them at one time or another.\
 \
 swindled = cheated or tricked\
 \
 (paragraph 3) One day, as Gregor listened to the bagpipe music that drifted from the open windows of MacTavish’s mansion, he had an idea. That night, when his mother was asleep, he emptied the jug that held their money and counted it. After putting back a few coins for food, he put the rest in his pocket. The next morning, he hurried to the market, where he went from farmer to farmer, asking the prices of sheep for sale.\
 Gregor found many handsome animals, but they were all too expensive. When he reached a stall with scrawny and sickly sheep, the owner beckoned to him. . . .\
 \
 (paragraph 4) Gregor shook his head and began to walk away. The man grabbed his sleeve and whispered in his ear, “This one will make her owner rich!” Gregor examined the old sheep with spindly legs and dirty, unkempt wool—the worst of the lot. “If she will make me rich,” said Gregor, “how is it that she has not done so for you?”\
 \
 (paragraph 5) The man paused, thinking. “I have not had her long enough!”\
 \
 (paragraph 6) “Nonsense,” said Gregor, but he gave the man his money and led the pitiful animal home.\
 \
 (paragraph 7) When his mother saw what he had bought with their money, she burst into tears. “My foolish son, what have you done? Now we will starve, and no one will help us!”\
 \
 (paragraph 8) “Do as I say, Mother, and we will be rich. I promise.”\
 \
 (paragraph 9) She wanted to believe him. Wiping her eyes with her ragged sleeve, she asked what he wanted her to do.\
 \
 (paragraph 10) “Go to market and tell everyone that your son has a sheep that will make whoever owns her rich,” said Gregor. . . .\
 \
 (paragraph 11) One morning, a carriage arrived. Two servants opened the door and a stout, welldressed gentleman emerged. His Tartan kilt was made of the finest wool, his ascot was pure silk, and his shoes had silver buckles. On his fat fingers were eight gold rings, and his pomaded hair glistened in the sun. It was MacTavish!\
 \
 Tartan kilt = traditional clothing worn by Scottish Highlanders\
 \
 ascot = a type of necktie\
 \
 (paragraph 12) Gregor bowed as if to royalty. MacTavish looked at him sternly. “I have come to rid you of the unfortunate sheep that everyone is talking about,” said MacTavish, opening his sporran. “I can pay your price and I will have her, even though she has done nothing for you, I see.” MacTavish sneered at Gregor.\
 \
 sporran = a small bag worn at the waist for holding personal items\
 \
 (paragraph 13) Gregor hugged Dear One. “I will not sell her to you!”\
 \
 (paragraph 14) ”At that, MacTavish, whose servants were helping him into his carriage, turned and marched back. “I will pay anything,” he said. “Name the price.”\
 \
 (paragraph 15) Gregor was ready. “That,” he said, pointing up to the mansion above them. “I will have the dwelling and everything in it—furniture, utensils, even the chest of gems under your bed.”\
 \
 (paragraph 16) “Done,” said MacTavish.\
 \
 (paragraph 17) The next day, Gregor and his mother moved into the mansion that had once belonged to MacTavish, and MacTavish brought Dear One to the market so that all might see he could indeed own anything he wanted. Then MacTavish and the sheep rode away in his carriage to another of his houses in a valley beyond the mountains.\
 \
 (paragraph 18) After months had passed and the sheep had done nothing to increase MacTavish’s riches, he realized he had been swindled. Furious beyond speech, he returned to the mansion, but Gregor would not open the gates.\
 \
 (paragraph 19) “I have been cheated!” shouted MacTavish.\
 \
 (paragraph 20) “You have not been cheated,” said Gregor. “I was the owner of the sheep, and she has made me rich, hasn’t she?”\
 \
 (paragraph 21) “Yes, but . . . ,” sputtered MacTavish.\
 \
 (paragraph 22) “Then you got what you paid for.” Gregor turned and walked away.\
 \
 (paragraph 21) Soon afterward, Gregor sold the chest of gems and bought the huge flock of sheep he and his mother had always wanted. He shared the rest of his fortune with the other poor families of the valley who had been cheated by MacTavish.\
Which of Gregor’s actions shows how he is different from MacTavish?\
(A) Gregor cheats another person.\
 (B) Gregor buys a sickly sheep.\
 (C) Gregor shares his wealth.\

Excerpt from A la Carte\
 by Tanita S. Davis\
 \
 (paragraph 1) “Homework?” My mother mouths the word exaggeratedly, eyebrows raised, and I\
 roll my eyes. Frowning, she points with her chin to the side door that leads to the stairs.\
 I roll my eyes again, mouthing, Okay, okay, not needing her to pantomime further what\
 she wants me to do. I hate the thought of leaving the clattering nerve center of the\
 restaurant to wrestle with my trigonometry homework in my mother’s quiet office\
 downstairs.\
 (paragraph 2) \"Order!\"\
 (paragraph 3) The bright lights and swirl of noise and motion are muffled as the kitchen door\
 swings closed behind me.\
 (paragraph 4) It’s hard to remember a time when the restaurant hasn’t been the center of our lives.\
 Mom used to be a copy editor and wrote food features for our local paper, the Clarion,\
 and she met Pia when she did a write-up on the culinary school Pia attended. Pia\
 thinks it was fate that Mom wanted to invest in a restaurant at the same time Pia\
 wanted to buy the old bank building.\
 (paragraph 5) La Salle Rouge doesn’t serve much in the way of “kid” food, since the menu doesn’t\
 cater to people my age on a cheap date, but I’ve loved everything about it from the first.\
 I started experimenting with being a vegetarian when I turned fourteen, but Pia still\
 found things to feed me and taught me to be creative with vegetables and tofu. I like to\
 think I’m the best-fed vegetarian in the state of California.\
 (paragraph 6) Pia’s been really good about teaching what she knows, and I decided early on that\
 this is the work I want to do—get out of school and get into the kitchen for good. Mom\
 and Pia have created a popular French-Asian-Californian fusion restaurant that has\
 gotten great reviews from food critics. They took the best of each other’s tastes—\
 Mom’s traditional Southern flavors and Pia’s French training combined with her\
 vegetable- and spice-savvy Cambodian tastes—and pulled off what one food critic\
 called “stylized food with unique flavor combinations in an intimate setting.”\
 (paragraph 7) Whatever that means.\
 (paragraph 8) Three years ago, when I started high school thirty pounds heavier than everyone in\
 my class, Mom and I came up with a light menu for La Salle Rouge, and it’s been such a\
 popular idea that Mom lets me come up with tasty, low-calorie desserts, which is one of\
 my favorite things to do. It hardly seems fair that I have to walk away from all of that\
 just to do trigonometry, but my mom says I have to finish school before I concentrate\
 on cooking. She says it’s smarter to have a “backup plan,” and she’s made me apply to\
 plenty of colleges and check out business majors just in case I ever want to do anything\
 else with my life. I guess that makes sense if you’re anybody other than me. When I\
 turn eighteen, I already know what I’m going to do.\
 (paragraph 9) First, I’m going to buy a plane ticket to D.C. and go to Julia Child’s kitchen at the\
 Smithsonian and leave roses. They don’t let you walk through it, but somewhere—I\
 don’t know where—I’m going to leave a bouquet and a little note for her. Julia Child is\
 my patron saint (patron saint: an inspiring person admired for his or her work). She’s the queen of all reasons people can do anything they want in\
 life. Saint Julia didn’t start cooking until she was practically forty, and she went on to\
 do TV shows and make cookbooks and be this huge part of culinary history. She never\
 got too fancy, she never freaked out, and she was never afraid to try new things. I want\
 to be just like her—except maybe get famous faster.\
 (paragraph 10) The second thing I’m going to do is buy myself a set of knives. Pia swears by this set\
 of German steel knives she got when she graduated, but I’ve seen the TV chef Kylie\
 Kwong use a phenomenal-looking ceramic knife on her show on the Discovery\
 Channel. Either way, knives are what the best chefs have of their very own.\
 (paragraph 11) The third thing I’m going to do, after I get back from Washington and get my knives,\
 is . . . get discovered. Somehow. I know I’m going to have to pay my dues, but I’m so\
 ready for my real life to start. It’s not something I admit to a lot, but my real dream is to\
 be a celebrity chef. Do you know how many African American female chefs there\
 aren’t? And how many vegetarian chefs have their own shows? The field is wide open\
 for stardom. Every time I watch old episodes of Saint Julia, I imagine that I have my\
 own cooking show. The way celebrity chefs do it now, I could also have a line of\
 cooking gear, cookbooks, aprons, the works. People would know my name, ask for my\
 autograph, and try my recipes. All I have to do is finish my trig homework and get back\
 into the kitchen.\
Read this sentence from paragraph 9.\
 She’s the queen of all reasons people can do anything they want in life.\
 What does this sentence suggest about Julia Child?\
(A) Her famous kitchen became part of a cooking museum.\
 (B) She was successful in a career that interested her.\
 (C) She always remained calm in the kitchen.\
 (D) Her cooking style created unique flavor combinations.\

. . . At times, gas has been known to travel, with dire results, fifteen miles behind the lines.\
 \
 A gas, or smoke helmet, as it is called, at the best is a vile-smelling thing, and it is not long before one gets a violent headache from wearing it.\
 \
 Our eighteen-pounders were bursting in No Man’s Land, in an effort, by the artillery, to disperse the gas clouds.\
 \
 The fire step was lined with crouching men, bayonets fixed, and bombs near at hand to repel the expected attack.\
 \
 Our artillery had put a barrage of curtain fire on the German lines, to try and break up their attack and keep back re-inforcements.\
 \
 I trained my machine gun on their trench and its bullets were raking the parapet [spraying the wall].\
 \
 Then over they came, bayonets glistening. In their respirators, which have a large snout in front, they looked like some horrible nightmare. . . .\

“Janet Guthrie: Lady in the Fast\
 Lane” from Profifiles in Sports Courage\
 by Ken Rappoport\
 \
 (paragraph 1) It was no surprise that Janet Guthrie excelled at one of the most dangerous sports on Earth. She had always loved adventure and daring new experiences.\
 (paragraph 2) Janet was born on March 7, 1938, in Iowa City, Iowa, and lived on a farm for the first few years of her life. Her father, an airline pilot, later moved the family to South Florida, where Janet took up flying.\
 (paragraph 3) At 13, she had already flown an airplane. At age 16, Janet decided she wanted to try a free-fall parachute jump. In free-fall, the parachutist jumps out of a plane without opening the chute. After falling several hundred feet at more than 100 miles an hour, the cord is pulled to open the chute. Then, if all goes well, the parachutist floats safely to the ground.\
 (paragraph 4) Her father wouldn’t hear of it. “Absolutely not,” he said. “No free-fall!”\
 (paragraph 5) But Janet persisted. Finally, her father gave in. “Just one time,” he said, “but you have to be careful and do it the right way.”\
 (paragraph 6) He would allow her to jump only on two conditions: He would fly the plane and she would receive parachuting lessons before the jump.\
 (paragraph 7) Since there were no parachuting schools in South Florida at the time, Janet’s father hired a pro to give her private lessons. In her autobiography, Janet Guthrie—A Life at Full Throttle, Janet said the pro taught her how to pull the rip cord that opened the chute, how to absorb the shock after landing, and how to fasten the helmet so it wouldn’t fly off.\
 ♦ ♦ ♦\
 (paragraph 8) By the time she was 21, she had earned a commercial pilot’s license. She flew whenever she could break away from her classes at the University of Michigan.\
 (paragraph 9) After graduating, Guthrie got a job as a physicist in the aerospace industry. She saved her money for an entire year and bought a car. Guthrie wasn’t satisfied with just any car. She chose a Jaguar XK 120—the sleek and popular sports car that she had dreamed about since she was a teenager.\
 aerospace = a business involved with space flight\
 (paragraph 10) At first, Guthrie enjoyed just driving the car around Long Island, outside New York City. Then she heard about a local sports car club where members could compete. She loved her car and wanted to see how it would do on a track. Soon she was entering races—and winning them.\
 (paragraph 11) Excited by her success, Guthrie attended a driving school in Connecticut. She was a natural. Her instructor, veteran driver Gordon McKenzie, liked the way she handled her car. He suggested she try auto racing.\
 (paragraph 12) A thrill shot through Guthrie. What a great idea. Off she went to enroll in a racing car drivers’ school sponsored by the Sports Car Club of America. Guthrie swapped her Jaguar for a higher-priced model built especially for racing—the XK 140. Before long she taught herself how to take apart and rebuild its engine like a pro.\
 ♦ ♦ ♦\
 (paragraph 13) Guthrie’s career started to pick up speed.\
 (paragraph 14) She entered races all over the United States, finishing in some of the country’s most celebrated long-distance competitions. In 1973, she won the North Atlantic Road Racing Championship. A champion, yes, but a tired champion. By then she had been racing for 13 years. She was exhausted, broke, and thinking of leaving the sport.\
 (paragraph 15) That’s when she got the phone call. Someone named Vollstedt was asking her to drive his car in the 1976 Indy 500. No woman had ever driven in that race. This has to be a prank, thought Guthrie. But Vollstedt, an auto designer and builder from Oregon, wasn’t kidding. Could she drive a “championship” car? That was the big question.\
 (paragraph 16) With their open cockpits, wide wheelbases, and rear engines, championship cars were much different than the closed sports cars Guthrie had been accustomed to driving for many years.\
 (paragraph 17) “Before she would agree to drive for me,” Vollstedt said, “she wanted to see if she could handle the car.”\
 (paragraph 18) Vollstedt was wondering the same thing, too. He arranged for a secret test at the Ontario Motor Speedway near Los Angeles.\
 (paragraph 19) To get into top physical shape for Vollstedt’s test, Guthrie did exercises in front of her TV. One day she lost her balance, landed hard on her left foot, and fell to the floor. The doctors told her she had broken a bone and they put her foot in a heavy cast. How am I going to drive a racing car? she worried. Will I miss my big chance?\
 ♦ ♦ ♦\
 (paragraph 20) Broken ankle and all, Guthrie stepped into an unfamiliar car. She hit the accelerator. When her car got up to speed, Guthrie couldn’t believe the feeling. “What a thrill,” she said. “It was like going to the moon.”\
 (paragraph 21) Vollstedt was impressed with her time—an average speed of 178.52 miles per hour and a top speed of 196 mph.\
 (paragraph 22) Test passed.\
 (paragraph 23) She had showed Vollstedt she could drive the car. Now she had to show the rest of the world.\
Which sentence best represents a conflict between Guthrie and her father?\
(A) Guthrie’s father is concerned when she begins flying at a young age.\
 (B) Guthrie’s father thinks free-fall parachuting is too dangerous for her.\
 (C) Guthrie’s father is worried about her becoming a race car driver.\
 (D) Guthrie’s father insists she has to take private parachuting lessons.\

Iranian women made considerable progress during the Pahlavi era (1925–1979). Education for both girls and boys was free. When Tehran University opened in 1936, Iran’s first university admitted both men and women. In 1963, women acquired the right to vote and run for parliament. Under the Family Protection Law, women won the right to petition for divorce and gain child custody. A husband could no longer unilaterally [single-handedly] divorce his wife or automatically gain custody of the children. The marriage age for girls was raised from 13 to 18. And men needed the court’s permission to take a second wife. By 1978, on the eve of Iran’s revolution, 22 women sat in parliament and 333 women served on elected local councils. One-third of university students were female. Two million women were in the work force, more than 146,000 of them in the civil service. . . .\
 \
 Under revolutionary leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, Iran’s new theocracy gave priority to Islamic tradition over modern mores [practices]. One of the revolutionary government’s first acts was to suspend the Family Protection Law and dismantle Family Courts. Men were once again free to divorce their wives by simple declaration; they also gained exclusive custody of their children. Women could no longer file for divorce unless the right was stipulated [clearly stated] in marriage contracts, and they lost the right to child custody. Restrictions on polygamy were also removed. The marriage age for girls was reduced to puberty, which is nine under Islamic law. In 1981, parliament approved the Islamic Law of Retribution, introducing flogging, stoning and payment of blood money for crimes ranging from adultery to violation of Islamic dress codes. . . .\

 The Edo period followed many years of political and social upheaval. The previous division of Japanese history known as the Sengoku period (warring states period) was dominated by wars fought between various political and religious factions for the control of the country. These wars came to an end with the unification of Japan by the great generals Oda Nobunaga and Toyotomi Hideyoshi and eventually Tokugawa Ieyasu who formed Japan’s final Shogunate.\
 Ieyasu consolidated his power through a series of social changes including the introduction of a strict class system and the tight control of the ruling daimyo families from the capital city Edo. Individuals had no legal rights and the family became very important at all social levels.…\

Two Days With No Phone\
 by Sarah Jane Brian\
 Experts worry that teen texting is out of control. Could you give up your phone for 48 hours? Our brave volunteers did.\
 (paragraph 1) Instead of sleeping, Kenny Alarcon, 16, often texts with his friends through the night. \"You get an urge'\" explains the teen, who lives in the Bronx in New York City. \"When I get a text, I'm itching to respond to it even if I want to sleep.\"\
 (paragraph 2) Franchesca Garcia, a high school senior from Providence, Rhode Island, has also felt the need to stay constantly connected. We asked how many texts she sent and received each day. \"I don't know . . . maybe 1,000?\" she answered. \"It's too many to count.\"\
 (paragraph 3) It probably won't surprise you that teens are texting more than ever before. Some experts are worried about how all that texting is affecting teenagers' lives.\
 \
 Teens in Trouble?\
 \
 (paragraph 4) One concern is that students might not learn correct grammar and spelling if most of the writing they do is made up of text messages. Some people also worry that because teens text so much, they don't spend enough time talking with others face-to-face. That could be hurting their relationships with friends and family.\
 (paragraph 5) Plus, all that texting (and time on social media) takes away from hours that could be spent studying, exercising, pursuing a hobby, or just relaxing.\
 (paragraph 6) Dr. Elizabeth Dowdell is a professor at Villanova University in Pennsylvania. She says that many people expect to be able to access anyone or to be accessed by anyone at any time. \"It's very appealing, especially to a middle or high school student,\" she explains. \"The problem is, there's no downtime.\" And people need downtime-especially when it comes to sleep.\
 \
 Sleep Texting\
 \
 (paragraph 7) Both Franchesca and Kenny told us that they wake up several times during the night to text. Kenny even sleeps with his phone beneath his pillow.\
 (paragraph 8) Dr. Dowdell says that it's common for teens' sleep to be interrupted by texts. Sometimes teens even send texts filled with nonsense words when they don't wake up all the way. She has been studying this trend, which she calls \"sleep texting.\"\
 (paragraph 9) Why is sleep texting a problem? \"Adolescents need a solid 8, 10, even 1 1 hours of sleep to really function and to think clearly\", reports Dr. Dowdell. If they regularly lose sleep, she adds, teens may start having trouble in school. They may become grumpy, angry, or depressed. A lack of sleep can lead to weight gain and even obesity. That's because many people turn to junk food for quick energy when they are tired.\
 \
 The 48-Hour Challenge\
 \
 (paragraph 10) According to Dr. Dowdell, teens need to learn that they can-and should-turn off their phones sometimes. So we decided to have Kenny and Franchesca do an experiment.\
 (paragraph 11) These were the rules: No phone for 48 hours. No computer or Internet either, unless it was for schoolwork. No Twitter, no Instagram.\
 (paragraph 12) Would these two teenagers be able to do it?\
 (paragraph 13) \"I think I'm going to feel really isolated\", Kenny worried. Franchesca was nervous but brave. \"I'm excited for the challenge\", she said. \"I don't know what's going to happen.\"\
 (paragraph 14) Kenny and Franchesca handed their phones to their mothers for safekeeping. The\
 challenge was on.\
 \
 The Results\
 \
 (paragraph 15) We caught up with Kenny and Franchesca after 48 phone-free hours. \"Wow, it was pure torture\", Kenny joked. But though life with no phone wasn't easy, he admitted \"it had benefits.\"\
 (paragraph 16) Sure, Kenny missed his friends, and he was sad at times. But he also felt relief from the constant texting. \"Sometimes it's teenager drama, people gossiping\" he explained. \"I felt less stressed because I didn't have to be involved.\"\
 (paragraph 17) Instead of texting, Kenny went to the gym and caught up on schoolwork. The first night, he told us, \"I slept for 18 hours!\" He also spent time sitting with his family and talking. Kenny's mom helped him with homework for the first time in two years. Said Kenny, \"I felt closer to my parents.\"\
 (paragraph 18) Franchesca had an even happier result when she put away her phone. \"I loved it!\" she said. \"I was going to the gym and hanging out with friends and playing basketball. I had a wonderful experience.\" She slept better too.\
 (paragraph 19) Franchesca decided to continue the experiment for a while. \"I think I'll be so much smarter and healthier,' she explained. \"Everybody in the world should try it.\"\
 (paragraph 20) Kenny doesn't plan to give up his phone again. But he now knows that he can live without it. Said the teen, \"It was a reality check.\"\
What does Dr. Elizabeth Dowdell suggest when she says \"people expect to be able to access anyone or to be accessed by anyone at any time\"? (paragraph 6)\
(A) Teens need to stay available by phone at all times.\
 (B) Many teens want to own a phone that receives texts.\
 (C) Constant phone use is a behavior of teens that cannot be changed.\
 (D) Teens are so used to having phones that nonstop texting has become a habit.\

Reading Comprehension Passage B\
 \
 Ithaka (Ithaka - In the epic, The Odyssey, it took Odysseus 10 years to return to his Greek island home of Ithaka after\
 winning the Trojan war)\
 \
 As you set out for Ithaka\
 hope the voyage is a long one,\
 full of adventure, full of discovery.\
 Laistrygonians and Cyclops, (Laistrygonians and Cyclops - monsters that Odysseus encountered on his journey home)\
 (line 5) angry Poseidon (Poseidon - the Greek god of the sea who sought to punish Odysseus for harming his son, a Cyclops)—don’t be afraid of them:\
 you’ll never find things like that on your way\
 as long as you keep your thoughts raised high,\
 as long as a rare excitement\
 stirs your spirit and your body.\
 (line 10) Laistrygonians and Cyclops,\
 wild Poseidon—you won’t encounter them\
 unless you bring them along inside your soul,\
 unless your soul sets them up in front of you.\
 \
 Hope the voyage is a long one.\
 (line 15) May there be many a summer morning when,\
 with what pleasure, what joy,\
 you come into harbors seen for the first time;\
 may you stop at Phoenician trading stations\
 to buy fine things,\
 (line 20) mother of pearl and coral, amber and ebony,\
 sensual perfume of every kind—\
 as many sensual perfumes as you can;\
 and may you visit many Egyptian cities\
 to gather stores of knowledge from their scholars.\
 \
 (line 25) Keep Ithaka always in your mind.\
 Arriving there is what you are destined for.\
 But do not hurry the journey at all.\
 Better if it lasts for years,\
 so you are old by the time you reach the island,\
 (line 30) wealthy with all you have gained on the way,\
 not expecting Ithaka to make you rich.\
 \
 Ithaka gave you the marvelous journey.\
 Without her you would not have set out.\
 She has nothing left to give you now.\
 (line 35) And if you find her poor, Ithaka won’t have fooled you.\
 Wise as you will have become, so full of experience,\
 you will have understood by then what these Ithakas mean.\
 \

Excerpt from A la Carte\
 by Tanita S. Davis\
 \
 (paragraph 1) “Homework?” My mother mouths the word exaggeratedly, eyebrows raised, and I\
 roll my eyes. Frowning, she points with her chin to the side door that leads to the stairs.\
 I roll my eyes again, mouthing, Okay, okay, not needing her to pantomime further what\
 she wants me to do. I hate the thought of leaving the clattering nerve center of the\
 restaurant to wrestle with my trigonometry homework in my mother’s quiet office\
 downstairs.\
 (paragraph 2) \"Order!\"\
 (paragraph 3) The bright lights and swirl of noise and motion are muffled as the kitchen door\
 swings closed behind me.\
 (paragraph 4) It’s hard to remember a time when the restaurant hasn’t been the center of our lives.\
 Mom used to be a copy editor and wrote food features for our local paper, the Clarion,\
 and she met Pia when she did a write-up on the culinary school Pia attended. Pia\
 thinks it was fate that Mom wanted to invest in a restaurant at the same time Pia\
 wanted to buy the old bank building.\
 (paragraph 5) La Salle Rouge doesn’t serve much in the way of “kid” food, since the menu doesn’t\
 cater to people my age on a cheap date, but I’ve loved everything about it from the first.\
 I started experimenting with being a vegetarian when I turned fourteen, but Pia still\
 found things to feed me and taught me to be creative with vegetables and tofu. I like to\
 think I’m the best-fed vegetarian in the state of California.\
 (paragraph 6) Pia’s been really good about teaching what she knows, and I decided early on that\
 this is the work I want to do—get out of school and get into the kitchen for good. Mom\
 and Pia have created a popular French-Asian-Californian fusion restaurant that has\
 gotten great reviews from food critics. They took the best of each other’s tastes—\
 Mom’s traditional Southern flavors and Pia’s French training combined with her\
 vegetable- and spice-savvy Cambodian tastes—and pulled off what one food critic\
 called “stylized food with unique flavor combinations in an intimate setting.”\
 (paragraph 7) Whatever that means.\
 (paragraph 8) Three years ago, when I started high school thirty pounds heavier than everyone in\
 my class, Mom and I came up with a light menu for La Salle Rouge, and it’s been such a\
 popular idea that Mom lets me come up with tasty, low-calorie desserts, which is one of\
 my favorite things to do. It hardly seems fair that I have to walk away from all of that\
 just to do trigonometry, but my mom says I have to finish school before I concentrate\
 on cooking. She says it’s smarter to have a “backup plan,” and she’s made me apply to\
 plenty of colleges and check out business majors just in case I ever want to do anything\
 else with my life. I guess that makes sense if you’re anybody other than me. When I\
 turn eighteen, I already know what I’m going to do.\
 (paragraph 9) First, I’m going to buy a plane ticket to D.C. and go to Julia Child’s kitchen at the\
 Smithsonian and leave roses. They don’t let you walk through it, but somewhere—I\
 don’t know where—I’m going to leave a bouquet and a little note for her. Julia Child is\
 my patron saint (patron saint: an inspiring person admired for his or her work). She’s the queen of all reasons people can do anything they want in\
 life. Saint Julia didn’t start cooking until she was practically forty, and she went on to\
 do TV shows and make cookbooks and be this huge part of culinary history. She never\
 got too fancy, she never freaked out, and she was never afraid to try new things. I want\
 to be just like her—except maybe get famous faster.\
 (paragraph 10) The second thing I’m going to do is buy myself a set of knives. Pia swears by this set\
 of German steel knives she got when she graduated, but I’ve seen the TV chef Kylie\
 Kwong use a phenomenal-looking ceramic knife on her show on the Discovery\
 Channel. Either way, knives are what the best chefs have of their very own.\
 (paragraph 11) The third thing I’m going to do, after I get back from Washington and get my knives,\
 is . . . get discovered. Somehow. I know I’m going to have to pay my dues, but I’m so\
 ready for my real life to start. It’s not something I admit to a lot, but my real dream is to\
 be a celebrity chef. Do you know how many African American female chefs there\
 aren’t? And how many vegetarian chefs have their own shows? The field is wide open\
 for stardom. Every time I watch old episodes of Saint Julia, I imagine that I have my\
 own cooking show. The way celebrity chefs do it now, I could also have a line of\
 cooking gear, cookbooks, aprons, the works. People would know my name, ask for my\
 autograph, and try my recipes. All I have to do is finish my trig homework and get back\
 into the kitchen.\

Clash of the Condiments: Wasabi vs. the Chili Pepper\
 by Mary Beth Cox\
 \
 Most condiments are peaceable enough. The sauces, spreads, and pickles of the world\
 add flavor to our foods without kicking up much of a fuss. This is not true of the pungent\
 or “hot’’ condiments. They are more aggressive. They get our attention by purposely\
 causing us pain. These strong-armed seasonings are often the source of friendly\
 (line 5) competitions. Loyal fans will contend that their favorite pungent condiment is the one that\
 packs the most powerful punch. Ladies and gentlemen, you are cordially welcomed to just\
 such a contest. Here it is, the Match of the Moment: Wasabi vs. the Chili Pepper.\
 IN YOUR CORNERS\
 Introducing in the Green Corner, hailing from the island nation of Japan, sushi’s\
 inseparable sidekick: Wasabi! Wasabia japonica grows wild on the cool, damp banks of\
 (line 10) Japan’s many mountain streams. The chill of its habitat is quite ironic since wasabi is\
 famous for bringing the heat. The plant is a botanical relative of mustard and horseradish.\
 Pungency runs in the family. Traditionally, wasabi is prepared by grating its rootstock on\
 the abrasive skin of an angel shark. Authentic wasabi is relatively rare and difficult to\
 come by. The emerald condiment that is served outside of Japan is almost always\
 (line 15) horseradish pulp dyed with green food coloring. Whether the wasabi is real or whether it’s\
 the more common substitute, a whopping snootful will make you cry for your momma!\
 And in the red corner, originating from the Central and South Americas, now an\
 international culinary superstar: the Chili Pepper. Chili peppers are fruits of the plants of\
 the botanical genus Capsicum. They are related to the tomato and the eggplant. They’re\
 (line 20) the renegades in an otherwise mild-mannered botanical family. Chili peppers include but\
 are not limited to the poblano, the cayenne, the jalapeño, the tabasco, the habanero, and\
 the serrano. One of these culprits sometimes goes by the alias “chipotle.’’ A chipotle\
 (pronounced chee-POHT-lay) is none other than a dried smoked jalape ño. Chilies were\
 introduced to the non-American world by Christopher Columbus, who mistakenly\
 (line 25) identified them as variants of black pepper. Chilies have since taken the culinary world by\
 storm. They appear alongside dishes served around the globe, from the Basque provinces\
 to North Africa and the Middle East, to India and Southeast Asia. A potent chili pepper in\
 the kisser will make you rue the day you were born!\
 POWERFUL PUNCHES\
 Both wasabi and chilies are condiments of world-class pungency. But how do they\
 (line 30) match up head to head? Each has its own unique tactical move. Each has its own special\
 point of attack. The active ingredient of the wasabi plant is stored stealthily in its cells.\
 Under normal growing conditions, this ingredient is completely harmless. It’s not until the\
 plant’s cells are ruptured (as by the grating action of angel shark skin) that the trouble\
 begins. Enzymes convert the ingredient into molecules of allyl isothiocyanate. It’s the\
 (line 35) chemical characteristics of these irritating molecules that are the secret to wasabi’s\
 pungency. Allyl isothiocyanate molecules are lightweight. They are volatile. They are also\
 soluble in water. As a consequence, the consumption of wasabi launches an airborne\
 assault on the consumer’s sinuses. Allyl isothiocyanate molecules waft up the nose and\
 back of the throat. They dissolve in the watery fluids they find there. They intercept nerve\
 (line 40) endings in the nasal passages. Specifically, these molecules target pain receptors of the\
 type known as TRPA I . TRPA I receptors respond to the attack by sending emergency\
 signals to the brain: “Yikes . . . we’ve gotten hold of something painfully hot!’’\
 Chili peppers conduct operations of a different sort. Their active ingredient is a\
 substance called capsaicin. It’s found in the spongy inner tissue of peppers, but it can leak\
 (line 45) onto the seeds and inner wall of the fruit. Capsaicin molecules are heavier than the\
 molecules of wasabi’s allyl isothiocyanate. They are not volatile. They prefer to dissolve in\
 oils, so they aren’t as easily dissolved in water. Capsaicin molecules instigate an incendiary\
 assault upon contact with exposed vulnerable surfaces. They cling to the tender tissues of\
 the lips, mouth, and throat. They burn eyes that are rubbed with capsaicin-laced fingers.\
 (line 50) Capsaicin molecules interact with pain receptors of the type TRPV I. Again an alert is\
 expedited to the brain: “Mayday! Mayday! Let’s not eat any more of that, please!’’\
 WHERE’S THE REFEREE?\
 So which of these condiments causes the most pain? To settle any contest, a scoring\
 system is required. There is a way to compare the relative heat intensities of the various\
 chili peppers. It’s called the Scoville scale. Scoville ratings are determined by brave human\
 (line 55) test subjects who willingly sip extracts of chili pepper juice. Extracted juices are diluted\
 again and again until their heat can no longer be detected. A high rating on the Scoville\
 scale means that a lot of dilutions are necessary to eliminate the pain caused by a\
 particular pepper. Unfortunately, Scoville ratings are not applicable to wasabi. The method\
 is specifically designed to extract capsaicin from chili peppers. It doesn’t work for allyl\
 (line 60) isothiocyanate, or for anything else.\
 Pepper pungencies are also compared by using chromatography. Chromatography is an\
 analytical technique that separates the chemical components of a mixture. After\
 separation, the amounts of each component are quantified. Chromatography can\
 determine how much capsaicin is in a pepper. It can also determine how much allyl\
 (line 65) isothiocyanate is in wasabi. If two chili peppers have the same amount of capsaicin, it can\
 be assumed that those peppers are equally “hot.’’ But the same assumption cannot be made\
 when comparing chili peppers to wasabi. There’s no way to know if equal amounts of\
 capsaicin and allyl isothiocyanate cause equal degrees of pain. So chromatography cannot\
 definitively judge this contest.\
 (line 70) It isn’t even possible to directly measure and compare nerve responses, since\
 two different types of pain receptors are involved. Wasabi and chili peppers are like\
 pungent apples and oranges. There’s no objective way to declare one more potent than the\
 other. This friendly competition won’t be settled anytime soon. Everyone is free to chime\
 in with an opinion. You just have to try both of these pungent powerhouses, then root for\
 (line 75) your own favorite flavor of pain.\
How do lines 1 through 7 mainly establish the tone of the article?\
(A) They create curiosity by inviting the reader to provide an opinion on the two condiments.\
 (B) They create interest by describing loyal fans supporting their favorite condiment.\
 (C) They create humor by personifying two condiments in an imagined contest.\
 (D) They create tension by analyzing the popularity of two condiments.\

In West Africa, the Harmattan is a dry, dust-filled wind.\
 Excerpt from A Scrap and a Robe\
 by Myrina D. McCullough\
 \
 (paragraph 1) The West African Harmattan whipped up a billow of dust. Suddenly Sali spied a scrap of glorious orange damask cloth turning in the hot wind like a flame. She followed as it danced down a street she didn’t know very well. She skipped over holes and skirted people on chairs.\
 damask = woven cloth\
 skirted = went around\
 (paragraph 2) All at once the wind died down, and the scrap settled gently on the scratchy, sandy road.\
 (paragraph 3) Sali picked up the cloth and gazed at it with admiring eyes. She turned it this way and that in the sun and imagined herself in a flowing dlokibani made of such cloth. This was a treasure, and she would take it home for her little wooden doll. It would surely make a lovely headpiece for that lucky one.\
 dlokibani or dloki = a long dress\
 (paragraph 4) Sali wandered back the way she had come, slowly now. At the corner of the street, she passed the table vendor, who was selling his dusty packets of tea and two-pill packs of aspirin. She passed Ami’s mother, roasting peanuts and selling them by the handful. She turned onto the larger street and passed a plastic-goods store that displayed rows and rows of brightly colored plastic plates, bowls, and teapots. She glanced into the next shop and then stopped short. It was a fabric shop! There on the high counter was an entire bolt of the same wondrous cloth she held in her hand!\
 (paragraph 5) The next day Sali went back to the cloth shop. She stood near the door and watched the storekeeper. He measured and cut, as one person after another bought pieces of cloth. Her prized orange damask was back on a high shelf to the rear of the store.\
 (paragraph 6) After a while the shopkeeper looked at Sali. “Why do you stand so long at the door?” he asked.\
 (paragraph 7) Sali took a deep breath and said, “I would like to help you in the store till I could earn enough of that orange cloth to make a dlokibani for myself.”\
 (paragraph 8) The orange fabric glowed in a shaft of light from the uncovered bulb at the back of the store.\
 (paragraph 9) “That is very special and expensive cloth, little one,” the shopkeeper told her.\
 (paragraph 10) So she swept the courtyard and threw away scraps. She pushed big rolls of cloth back and forth. She ran to buy cough drops and peanuts and kola nuts for the shopkeeper. For days and days she worked.\
 (paragraph 11) Finally, one day the store owner lifted down the lustrous roll of orange damask and measured out several yards. “You’ve worked well for this cloth, Sali,” he said. “I thank you.”\
 (paragraph 12) Sali rushed straight home with her treasure. Carefully she placed the cloth in her trunk.\
 (paragraph 13) But how was she to get the dloki made? Sali did not know how to sew. Her mother always had their clothes made by a tailor who sat in a tiny shop several blocks from their house.\
 (paragraph 14) Sali went and stood under a tree near the tailor’s shop. She watched the people come and go. The tailor would whip out his measuring tape and see how tall the people were, how fat they were, how long their arms, how short their necks. He measured every part of them.\
 (paragraph 15) After almost a whole day the tailor noticed Sali.\
 (paragraph 16) “What are you doing there, little girl?” he asked.\
 (paragraph 17) “I have some beautiful cloth,” she said, “and I want it sewn into a dlokibani. Could I work for you to pay for sewing it into a robe for me?”\
 (paragraph 18) The tailor agreed. Once again Sali worked for days and days. She swept and fanned the tea coals and held scissors and brought thread. At last, the tailor said, “Bring me the cloth, Sali.”\
 (paragraph 19) Sali rushed home and brought back the satiny, shining cloth. She also brought her doll, its small head still neatly wrapped in the swatch of orange. The tailor took his tape and measured Sali, shoulder to ankle, shoulder to elbow, left shoulder to right shoulder. Then he started cutting the billows of orange fabric.\
 (paragraph 20) The next day was an important holiday called Tabaski. Drums were beating in many neighborhoods. Relatives and friends came to visit Sali’s family. Sali slipped quietly away. Soon her mother missed her. “Now where has Sali gone?” she exclaimed.\
 (paragraph 21) Just then, Sali walked in, proudly wearing a beautiful orange dloki with a matching headdress. In her arms she carried her doll, dressed exactly as she was!\
Which quotation best supports a theme of the story?\
(A) “ ‘Why do you stand so long at the door?’ he asked.” (paragraph 6)\
 (B) “ ‘You’ve worked well for this cloth, Sali,’ he said.” (paragraph 11)\
 (C) “Sali rushed straight home with her treasure.” (paragraph 12)\
 (D) “Then he started cutting the billows of orange fabric.” (paragraph 19)\

Excerpt from Wheels of Change: How Women Rode the Bicycle to Freedom (With a Few Flat Tires Along the Way)\
 \
 by Sue Macy\
 \
 (paragraph 1) Women’s rights crusader Elizabeth Cady Stanton was in her eighties during the heyday of the bicycle, and no evidence exists to show that she actually ever rode one. But there was no better or more eloquent advocate for women and the wheel. In 1895, Stanton contributed an article to the American Wheelman celebrating this “wonderful new style of locomotion.” In the article, titled “The Era of the Bicycle,” she pointed out that cycling was increasing people’s mobility, eliminating the cost of feeding and housing horses, and encouraging the building of good roads. However, she saved her greatest praise for the bicycle’s effects on women. “The bicycle,” she wrote, “will inspire women with more courage, self-respect and self-reliance and make the next generation more vigorous of mind and of body; for feeble mothers do not produce great statesmen, scientists and scholars.”\
 \
 (paragraph 2) For all the practical benefits of the two-wheeler, the fact is that it brought about a cosmic shift in women’s private and public lives. With the rise of industry and the move from a rural to an urban economy in the 19th century, American women had become increasingly confined to their homes. Young girls could play outside, but when they matured, their freedom of movement was greatly restricted. “At sixteen years of age, I was enwrapped in the long skirts that impeded every footstep,” remembered Frances Willard, who in 1895 wrote a best-selling account of how she learned to ride abicycle at age 53. “I have detested walking and felt with a certain noble disdain that the conventions of life had cut me off from what . . . had been one of life’s sweetest joys.”\
 \
 (paragraph 3) While wealthier women were saddled with long skirts and restrictive corsets, those who were less well off worked anonymously in mills and factories. All in all, the result was the same. Except in a few instances, the public image of America was male. Politicians, soldiers, business leaders, and even the leading athletes in the new sports of baseball and football were all men. But the bicycle changed that. Suddenly, women were leaving their homes to cycle and socialize on country roads and city streets. Bicycle racers such as Louise Armaindo and Frankie Nelson had their exploits splashed all over the papers. Bicycle manufacturers, intent on mining an untapped market, showed female models in their advertisements. Thanks to the wheel, women were starting to be seen and heard in public life.\
 \
 (paragraph 4) It was not a stretch for some cyclists to see the possibility of a larger role for women in the world. When she conquered the wheel, Frances Willard was a former university president and the longtime president of the Woman’s Christian Temperance Union, which fought to prohibit the use of alcoholic beverages and to win women the right to vote. Willard saw parallels between learning to ride and learning to live. “I began to feel that myself plus the bicycle equaled myself plus the world, upon whose spinning wheel we must all learn to ride,” she wrote. “He who succeeds, or, to be more exact in handing over my experience, she who succeeds in gaining the mastery of [a bicycle], will gain the mastery of life.”\
 \
 (paragraph 5) For decades, Willard, along with Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Susan B. Anthony, and many others, had been working toward increased political and economic rights for women. Now the bicycle brought a taste of independence to women on a very personal level, and some of them took the opportunity to express their discontent with old traditions and expectations. In August 1895, a cyclist named Ann Strong caused a stir when she compared the value of a bicycle to that of a husband in the Minneapolis Tribune. “I can’t see but that a wheel is just as good company as most husbands,” she declared. “I would as lief (lief - happily) talk to one inanimate object as another; and I’d a great deal rather talk to one that can’t answer than one that won’t.” Strong then contrasted the joy of cycling with the challenges of raising a family. “You can make your wheel tidy over night,” she said, “and it never kicks off its shoes the very last minute, and never smears itself with molasses. When you are ready you can start. No little elbows are stuck in your ribs; there is no wiggling; screams at the cars or at the candy stores. You glide along, silently, smoothly, swiftly.”\
 \
 (paragraph 6) Some stated the liberating effects of the bicycle with less sarcasm. “The bicycle has brought to women a healthful, wholesome means of securing a degree of freedom and independence that no amount of discussion regarding ‘women’s rights’ would ever have produced,” wrote the L.A.W. Bulletin and Good Roads magazine in 1898. Meanwhile, Munsey’s Magazine assessed the impact of the wheel on women in a special bicycle-themed issue. “If she has ridden her bicycle into new fields, becoming in the process a new creature, it has been gradually and unconsciously,” the editors wrote.\
 \
 (paragraph 7) “She did not have to be born again in some mysterious fashion, becoming a strange creature, a ‘new woman.’ She is more like the ‘eternal feminine,’ who has taken on wings, and who is using them with an ever increasing delight in her new power.” Indeed, many bicycle companies at home and abroad did put wings on the women in their advertisements, emphasizing that they had taken flight.\
 \
 (paragraph 8) Not all publications treated the emergence of the “new woman” with the same level of approval. Some mocked her, while others just seemed baffled by her. Her new way of dressing, in bloomers or divided skirts or skirts with shortened hems, certainly disturbed the old social order, but so did her confidence and daring. These traits led commentators to worry that the differences between the sexes were being blurred, a fear that was reinforced as the four newest states—Wyoming, Colorado, Utah, and Idaho—granted women the right to vote in the 1890s. Would the bicycle help bring about a new kind of equality between men and women? Elizabeth Cady Stanton and her colleagues certainly hoped so. At any rate, the image of a female cyclist quickly became associated with efforts to win more rights for women.\

Reading Comprehension Passage C\
 \
 “The Russell-Einstein Manifesto,” signed by a group of eleven intellectuals and scientists including Bertrand Russell and Albert Einstein, was written at the height of the Cold War.\
 \
 In the tragic situation which confronts humanity, we feel that scientists should\
 assemble in conference to appraise the perils that have arisen as a result of the development\
 of weapons of mass destruction, and to discuss a resolution in the spirit of the appended\
 draft.\
 \
 (line 5) We are speaking on this occasion, not as members of this or that nation, continent, or\
 creed, but as human beings, members of the species Man, whose continued existence is in\
 doubt. The world is full of conflicts; and, overshadowing all minor conflicts, the titanic\
 struggle between Communism and anti-Communism. …\
 \
 We have to learn to think in a new way. We have to learn to ask ourselves, not what steps\
 (line 10) can be taken to give military victory to whatever group we prefer, for there no longer are\
 such steps; the question we have to ask ourselves is: what steps can be taken to prevent a\
 military contest of which the issue must be disastrous to all parties? …\
 \
 No doubt in an H-bomb (H-bomb — hydrogen bomb) war great cities would be obliterated. But this is one of the\
 minor disasters that would have to be faced. If everybody in London, New York, and\
 (line 15) Moscow were exterminated, the world might, in the course of a few centuries, recover from\
 the blow. But we now know, especially since the Bikini test, (Bikini test — reference to an American test of a hydrogen bomb conducted at the Bikini Atoll in the Pacific Ocean on March 1st, 1954. The bomb sent radioactive debris across the globe) that nuclear bombs can\
 gradually spread destruction over a very much wider area than had been supposed. …\
 \
 Many warnings have been uttered by eminent men of science and by authorities in\
 military strategy. None of them will say that the worst results are certain. What they do say\
 (line 20) is that these results are possible, and no one can be sure that they will not be realized. We\
 have not yet found that the views of experts on this question depend in any degree upon\
 their politics or prejudices. They depend only, so far as our researches have revealed, upon\
 the extent of the particular expert’s knowledge. We have found that the men who know most\
 are the most gloomy.\
 \
 (line 25) Here, then, is the problem which we present to you, stark and dreadful and inescapable:\
 Shall we put an end to the human race; or shall mankind renounce war? People will not face\
 this alternative because it is so difficult to abolish war.\
 \
 The abolition of war will demand distasteful limitations of national sovereignty. But\
 what perhaps impedes understanding of the situation more than anything else is that the\
 (line 30) term “mankind” feels vague and abstract. People scarcely realize in imagination that the\
 danger is to themselves and their children and their grandchildren, and not only to a dimly\
 apprehended humanity. They can scarcely bring themselves to grasp that they, individually,\
 and those whom they love are in imminent (imminent — about to take place) danger of perishing agonizingly. And so they\
 hope that perhaps war may be allowed to continue provided modern weapons are\
 (line 35) prohibited.\
 \
 This hope is illusory. Whatever agreements not to use H-bombs had been reached in\
 time of peace, they would no longer be considered binding in time of war, and both sides\
 would set to work to manufacture H-bombs as soon as war broke out, for, if one side\
 manufactured the bombs and the other did not, the side that manufactured them would\
 (line 40) inevitably be victorious.\
 \
 Although an agreement to renounce nuclear weapons as part of a general reduction of\
 armaments would not afford an ultimate solution, it would serve certain important purposes.\
 First: any agreement between East and West is to the good in so far as it tends to diminish\
 tension. Second: the abolition of thermo-nuclear weapons, if each side believed that the\
 (line 45) other had carried it out sincerely, would lessen the fear of a sudden attack in the style of\
 Pearl Harbour, which at present keeps both sides in a state of nervous apprehension. We\
 should, therefore, welcome such an agreement, though only as a first step.\
 \
 Most of us are not neutral in feeling, but, as human beings, we have to remember that,\
 if the issues between East and West are to be decided in any manner that can give any\
 (line 50) possible satisfaction to anybody, whether Communist or anti-Communist, whether Asian or\
 European or American, whether White or Black, then these issues must not be decided by\
 war. We should wish this to be understood, both in the East and in the West.\
 \
 There lies before us, if we choose, continual progress in happiness, knowledge, and\
 wisdom. Shall we, instead, choose death, because we cannot forget our quarrels? We\
 (line 55) appeal, as human beings, to human beings: Remember your humanity, and forget the rest.\
 If you can do so, the way lies open to a new Paradise; if you cannot, there lies before you\
 the risk of universal death.\
 \
 Resolution\
 \
 We invite this Congress, (Congress — the group of scientists who signed the Manifesto) and through it the scientists of the world and the general\
 public, to subscribe to the following resolution:\
 \
 (line 60) “In view of the fact that in any future world war nuclear weapons will certainly be\
 employed, and that such weapons threaten the continued existence of mankind, we urge\
 the Governments of the world to realize, and to acknowledge publicly, that their\
 purpose cannot be furthered by a world war, and we urge them, consequently, to find\
 peaceful means for the settlement of all matters of dispute between them.”\

“Janet Guthrie: Lady in the Fast\
 Lane” from Profifiles in Sports Courage\
 by Ken Rappoport\
 \
 (paragraph 1) It was no surprise that Janet Guthrie excelled at one of the most dangerous sports on Earth. She had always loved adventure and daring new experiences.\
 (paragraph 2) Janet was born on March 7, 1938, in Iowa City, Iowa, and lived on a farm for the first few years of her life. Her father, an airline pilot, later moved the family to South Florida, where Janet took up flying.\
 (paragraph 3) At 13, she had already flown an airplane. At age 16, Janet decided she wanted to try a free-fall parachute jump. In free-fall, the parachutist jumps out of a plane without opening the chute. After falling several hundred feet at more than 100 miles an hour, the cord is pulled to open the chute. Then, if all goes well, the parachutist floats safely to the ground.\
 (paragraph 4) Her father wouldn’t hear of it. “Absolutely not,” he said. “No free-fall!”\
 (paragraph 5) But Janet persisted. Finally, her father gave in. “Just one time,” he said, “but you have to be careful and do it the right way.”\
 (paragraph 6) He would allow her to jump only on two conditions: He would fly the plane and she would receive parachuting lessons before the jump.\
 (paragraph 7) Since there were no parachuting schools in South Florida at the time, Janet’s father hired a pro to give her private lessons. In her autobiography, Janet Guthrie—A Life at Full Throttle, Janet said the pro taught her how to pull the rip cord that opened the chute, how to absorb the shock after landing, and how to fasten the helmet so it wouldn’t fly off.\
 ♦ ♦ ♦\
 (paragraph 8) By the time she was 21, she had earned a commercial pilot’s license. She flew whenever she could break away from her classes at the University of Michigan.\
 (paragraph 9) After graduating, Guthrie got a job as a physicist in the aerospace industry. She saved her money for an entire year and bought a car. Guthrie wasn’t satisfied with just any car. She chose a Jaguar XK 120—the sleek and popular sports car that she had dreamed about since she was a teenager.\
 aerospace = a business involved with space flight\
 (paragraph 10) At first, Guthrie enjoyed just driving the car around Long Island, outside New York City. Then she heard about a local sports car club where members could compete. She loved her car and wanted to see how it would do on a track. Soon she was entering races—and winning them.\
 (paragraph 11) Excited by her success, Guthrie attended a driving school in Connecticut. She was a natural. Her instructor, veteran driver Gordon McKenzie, liked the way she handled her car. He suggested she try auto racing.\
 (paragraph 12) A thrill shot through Guthrie. What a great idea. Off she went to enroll in a racing car drivers’ school sponsored by the Sports Car Club of America. Guthrie swapped her Jaguar for a higher-priced model built especially for racing—the XK 140. Before long she taught herself how to take apart and rebuild its engine like a pro.\
 ♦ ♦ ♦\
 (paragraph 13) Guthrie’s career started to pick up speed.\
 (paragraph 14) She entered races all over the United States, finishing in some of the country’s most celebrated long-distance competitions. In 1973, she won the North Atlantic Road Racing Championship. A champion, yes, but a tired champion. By then she had been racing for 13 years. She was exhausted, broke, and thinking of leaving the sport.\
 (paragraph 15) That’s when she got the phone call. Someone named Vollstedt was asking her to drive his car in the 1976 Indy 500. No woman had ever driven in that race. This has to be a prank, thought Guthrie. But Vollstedt, an auto designer and builder from Oregon, wasn’t kidding. Could she drive a “championship” car? That was the big question.\
 (paragraph 16) With their open cockpits, wide wheelbases, and rear engines, championship cars were much different than the closed sports cars Guthrie had been accustomed to driving for many years.\
 (paragraph 17) “Before she would agree to drive for me,” Vollstedt said, “she wanted to see if she could handle the car.”\
 (paragraph 18) Vollstedt was wondering the same thing, too. He arranged for a secret test at the Ontario Motor Speedway near Los Angeles.\
 (paragraph 19) To get into top physical shape for Vollstedt’s test, Guthrie did exercises in front of her TV. One day she lost her balance, landed hard on her left foot, and fell to the floor. The doctors told her she had broken a bone and they put her foot in a heavy cast. How am I going to drive a racing car? she worried. Will I miss my big chance?\
 ♦ ♦ ♦\
 (paragraph 20) Broken ankle and all, Guthrie stepped into an unfamiliar car. She hit the accelerator. When her car got up to speed, Guthrie couldn’t believe the feeling. “What a thrill,” she said. “It was like going to the moon.”\
 (paragraph 21) Vollstedt was impressed with her time—an average speed of 178.52 miles per hour and a top speed of 196 mph.\
 (paragraph 22) Test passed.\
 (paragraph 23) She had showed Vollstedt she could drive the car. Now she had to show the rest of the world.\
In paragraph 20, what does Guthrie mean when she says, “It was like going to the moon”?\
(A) She thinks driving a fast car is quite exciting.\
 (B) She believes racing can often be dangerous.\
 (C) She thinks the speed of the car is frightening.\
 (D) She believes racing is similar to space flight.\

Reading Comprehension Passage A\
 \
 Screeno\
 In the following passage, Cornelius Schmidt seeks refuge from a gloomy, rainy night by going to a movie. \
 \
 …At the door [of the theater] the uniformed ticket taker gave him a card on which was \
 printed a kind of checkerboard, having in each box a number. It was obviously the old game \
 of Lotto, the object being to get five numbers which were successive either horizontally or\
 vertically or in a diagonal. In the center, amid numbered boxes, was a box entitled\
 (line 5) GRATIS; (GRATIS - free, a space that could count as any number called) the management gave this box to the audience. …\
    The theatre fell into a semi-darkness, not the movie darkness, but one in which discreet\
 lights shone on both sides of the theatre and both sides of the stage. A white and pink\
 clockface flashed on the screen. It was, in fact, like a roulette wheel, and had numbers\
 running from 1 to 100. In the center was a pointer, which suddenly began to whirl furiously \
 (line 10) about the clockface, and then slowed down, and then stopped.\
    \"Ninety-nine!\" said the businesslike yet airy young man in an authoritative voice.\
 An usher wrote down the number upon a blackboard to the right of the screen. The pointer \
 spun again, at a tremendous pace, so that it was almost a moving blur for a moment, and\
 then clarified into its arrow-like straightness. The actual wheel was, of course, in the\
 (line 15) projection room.\
    \"Fifty-four!\" said the young master of ceremonies, simulating a dramatic tone.\
    \"SCREENO!\" cried a voice from the balcony in a mocking voice, while everyone\
 laughed, for obviously no one could have SCREENO as yet.\
    \"I am sorry, ladies and gentlemen,\" said the young man in an affable (affable - friendly) voice,\" but we will \
 (line 20) have to ask you not to be humorous about this. After all, money is involved, and there has\
 been much confusion in the past because various people insisted upon trying to be\
 funny.\"…\
    The pointer was revolving again. \"Thirty-nine!\" announced the young man. The\
 audience was not yet warmed up, because too few numbers had been called for anyone to \
 (line 25) be on the verge of winning. Cornelius, however, also had this third number and was pleased \
 no little by the course of events.\
    \"Forty-nine!\" announced the young man. …\
    \"Fourteen!\" cried the young man into the microphone which made his voice even more\
 official than otherwise. Cornelius did not have the number. He assured himself that the\
 (line 30) game was a fraud, that the management was obviously not going to permit anyone to win so \
 much money and that the whole business would obviously be controlled in the projection \
 room or by arranging the numbers on the cards. There was only one more chance, a drop\
 in the ocean. He slouched back in his seat, chiding himself for his great excitement. …\
    \"Twenty-five!\" the master of ceremonies called out.\
 (line 35)    \"Twenty-five! Twenty-five!\" said Cornelius to himself, and then, finding the number on\
 his card as the fifth consecutive horizontal number, he rose in his seat and shouted:\
    \"SCREENO!\" in a too loud voice which broke, and began to issue (to issue - to exit) from his aisle,\
 tripping over the feet of the people seated near him, some of whom were solicitous (solicitous - helpful) of his\
 walk, and eager to provide good advice as he passed. The attractiveness of the winner shone\
 (line 40) in him. …\
    An usher took his card, and checked it with the numbers on the blackboard. The young\
 man came over to oversee the usher. It seemed as if something was wrong, someone\
 had miscalculated, to look at the young man. The checking was done several times.\
 Very bureaucratic, said Cornelius to himself. Recovering, as the checkup proved that\
 (line 45) Cornelius had indeed won, he shook Cornelius’s hand and the whole theatre lighted up.\
    \"Lucky fellow,\" cried the balcony voice, amusing the audience again, by the envious\
 tone in his voice. …\
    The usher arrived with the money just as the persistent balcony voice called out,\
 \"Let’s go on with the show,\" and the audience began to clap again, wishing to have its\
 (line 50) chance at the other prizes.\
    But then, as the money was delivered to the young assistant manager, and he began\
 officiously to count it out, shuffle it, and arrange it, before paying Cornelius, a hoarse and \
 disused voice cried from the balcony:\
    \"SCREENO! SCREENO!\" …\
 (line 55)   \"SCREENO!\" came the voice again, this time nearer, as the new winner approached\
 the stairs from the balcony to the orchestra. The young assistant manager and the ushers \
 looked at each other in dismay. Something had obviously gone wrong, for usually no one\
 won the jackpot; two winners was inconceivable and would lead to bankruptcy. Someone\
 was going to lose his job because of this. …\
 (line 60)   \"My name is Casper Weingarten,\" said the old man, unasked, intruding himself upon\
 the huddle of the assistant manager and the ushers. He was very nervous, very excited.\
 \"I am a musician,\" he said, but no one paid any attention to him, except Cornelius.\
    And then the young assistant manager came over to the old man and, holding the card\
 up, showed him that he had not won, that he had mistaken a 7 for a 1 because the print had\
 (line 65) been on the left-hand side. \"Perhaps you’ll win one of the other prizes,\" he said,\
 courteously, \"since you already have four numbers in a row.\" …\
    Cornelius came over to look into the matter for himself. He took the card in his hand\
 and looked at the number in question. The old man looked at him, and then turned to the\
 assistant manager, saying:\
 (line 70)   \"Give me my money! I have won!\" …\
    \"Look here,\" said Cornelius tactfully to the assistant manager, \"it seems to me that you\
 can only assume that this is a 1. The blur is too faint to make it a seven.\"\
    \"I know it is a 7,\" said the assistant manager angrily, and when he said that, Cornelius\
 recognized immediately that he was so sure because the cards had been prepared in\
 (line 75) advance to obviate the possibility of two winners of the jackpot, or even one. Seeing this,\
 Cornelius began to feel sick and angry, as he always did when confronted with fraud or\
 cheating.\
    \"All my life I’ve been cheated,\" said the old man, wringing his hands. \"Give me my\
 money.\" An usher took his arm, as if to lead him from the stage, but the assistant manager\
 (line 80) deterred him, unwilling as yet to resort to force. …\
    \"My good man,\" said the assistant manager, \"Your hard luck is not my fault, nor this\
 theatre’s responsibility. Please do not cause a disturbance. Now if both of you will leave the\
 stage, we can go on with the other prizes and with the show.\"\
    In answer, the old man sat down upon the stage, looking grotesque there, with his head\
 (line 85) turned up. \"I will sit here until I am paid,\" he said tearfully. …\
    But the audience was won over, for no one wished to lose his chance at the remaining\
 $50. There was a murmuring of voices and someone cried out:\
    \"Go home and give us a chance.\" …\
    \"Call a cop,\" said another. …\
 (line 90)   Cornelius meditated with himself for a moment and then said: \"Listen, I will give you\
 half of the jackpot. Come on before you’re arrested.\" …\
    \"No,\" said Weingarten, \"I don’t want your money. I want mine. Give me my money,\"\
 he said towards the assistant manager.\
    Cornelius considered matters with himself again and came to a decision. Easy come,\
 (line 95) easy go, he said to himself, and then he told the old musician that he could have the whole\
 jackpot. The manager protested immediately, but Cornelius took the bills from his pocket\
 and began to count them out and give them to the musician, who accepted them with\
 a guilty look and trembling hands.\
    The audience saw what was happening and applauded vigorously, not because it was\
 (line 100) genuinely moved, but because it felt that it ought to applaud. Such applause is heard at\
 public gatherings when an abstraction too vacuous (vacuous - insincere) is mentioned or tribute is paid to a man\
 long dead. The assistant manager, trying to move in on Cornelius’s credit, came over to\
 shake hands with Cornelius. Cornelius, tempted to reject the proffered hand, accepted it\
 because he wished to cause no further disturbance.\
 (line 105)   The old man had risen and come over to Cornelius.\
    \"Thank you very much for your kindness,\" he said in the estranged voice of those who\
 have been weeping or overexcited.\
    \"Not at all,\" said Cornelius formally. Both descended from the stage together. …\

Two Days With No Phone\
 by Sarah Jane Brian\
 Experts worry that teen texting is out of control. Could you give up your phone for 48 hours? Our brave volunteers did.\
 (paragraph 1) Instead of sleeping, Kenny Alarcon, 16, often texts with his friends through the night. \"You get an urge'\" explains the teen, who lives in the Bronx in New York City. \"When I get a text, I'm itching to respond to it even if I want to sleep.\"\
 (paragraph 2) Franchesca Garcia, a high school senior from Providence, Rhode Island, has also felt the need to stay constantly connected. We asked how many texts she sent and received each day. \"I don't know . . . maybe 1,000?\" she answered. \"It's too many to count.\"\
 (paragraph 3) It probably won't surprise you that teens are texting more than ever before. Some experts are worried about how all that texting is affecting teenagers' lives.\
 \
 Teens in Trouble?\
 \
 (paragraph 4) One concern is that students might not learn correct grammar and spelling if most of the writing they do is made up of text messages. Some people also worry that because teens text so much, they don't spend enough time talking with others face-to-face. That could be hurting their relationships with friends and family.\
 (paragraph 5) Plus, all that texting (and time on social media) takes away from hours that could be spent studying, exercising, pursuing a hobby, or just relaxing.\
 (paragraph 6) Dr. Elizabeth Dowdell is a professor at Villanova University in Pennsylvania. She says that many people expect to be able to access anyone or to be accessed by anyone at any time. \"It's very appealing, especially to a middle or high school student,\" she explains. \"The problem is, there's no downtime.\" And people need downtime-especially when it comes to sleep.\
 \
 Sleep Texting\
 \
 (paragraph 7) Both Franchesca and Kenny told us that they wake up several times during the night to text. Kenny even sleeps with his phone beneath his pillow.\
 (paragraph 8) Dr. Dowdell says that it's common for teens' sleep to be interrupted by texts. Sometimes teens even send texts filled with nonsense words when they don't wake up all the way. She has been studying this trend, which she calls \"sleep texting.\"\
 (paragraph 9) Why is sleep texting a problem? \"Adolescents need a solid 8, 10, even 1 1 hours of sleep to really function and to think clearly\", reports Dr. Dowdell. If they regularly lose sleep, she adds, teens may start having trouble in school. They may become grumpy, angry, or depressed. A lack of sleep can lead to weight gain and even obesity. That's because many people turn to junk food for quick energy when they are tired.\
 \
 The 48-Hour Challenge\
 \
 (paragraph 10) According to Dr. Dowdell, teens need to learn that they can-and should-turn off their phones sometimes. So we decided to have Kenny and Franchesca do an experiment.\
 (paragraph 11) These were the rules: No phone for 48 hours. No computer or Internet either, unless it was for schoolwork. No Twitter, no Instagram.\
 (paragraph 12) Would these two teenagers be able to do it?\
 (paragraph 13) \"I think I'm going to feel really isolated\", Kenny worried. Franchesca was nervous but brave. \"I'm excited for the challenge\", she said. \"I don't know what's going to happen.\"\
 (paragraph 14) Kenny and Franchesca handed their phones to their mothers for safekeeping. The\
 challenge was on.\
 \
 The Results\
 \
 (paragraph 15) We caught up with Kenny and Franchesca after 48 phone-free hours. \"Wow, it was pure torture\", Kenny joked. But though life with no phone wasn't easy, he admitted \"it had benefits.\"\
 (paragraph 16) Sure, Kenny missed his friends, and he was sad at times. But he also felt relief from the constant texting. \"Sometimes it's teenager drama, people gossiping\" he explained. \"I felt less stressed because I didn't have to be involved.\"\
 (paragraph 17) Instead of texting, Kenny went to the gym and caught up on schoolwork. The first night, he told us, \"I slept for 18 hours!\" He also spent time sitting with his family and talking. Kenny's mom helped him with homework for the first time in two years. Said Kenny, \"I felt closer to my parents.\"\
 (paragraph 18) Franchesca had an even happier result when she put away her phone. \"I loved it!\" she said. \"I was going to the gym and hanging out with friends and playing basketball. I had a wonderful experience.\" She slept better too.\
 (paragraph 19) Franchesca decided to continue the experiment for a while. \"I think I'll be so much smarter and healthier,' she explained. \"Everybody in the world should try it.\"\
 (paragraph 20) Kenny doesn't plan to give up his phone again. But he now knows that he can live without it. Said the teen, \"It was a reality check.\"\
Which detail would be most important to include in a summary of the article?\
(A) Kenny admits to sleeping with his phone under his pillow.\
 (B) Franchesca claims to exchange a thousand texts per day.\
 (C) The teens engage in gossip and drama without their phones.\
 (D) The teens have more free time when they give up texting.\

Talking with Artists:\
 David Wiesner\
 compiled and edited by Pat Cummings\
 MY STORY\
 (paragraph 1) I think that I always knew I wanted to become an artist. I can't remember a time when I wasn't drawing and painting pictures. My oldest sister and my brother were artistic, and watching them draw fascinated me. They had many different art supplies around the house. There was, and still is, something very appealing about art materials: Boxes of pastels, with incredibly colored, thin, square sticks, fitting snugly into the slots in their trays. Little ink bottles with rubber stoppers and pens with interchangeable metal tips. The look, smell, and feel of rich black ink going onto bright white paper in broad, flat strokes or thin, sharp lines. I found this captivating.\
 (paragraph 2) In our town, the housepaint and wallpaper store also sold art supplies. I loved looking at all the exotic things they had for sale. Sandpaper blocks to sharpen pencils. Rows of numbered pencils, and erasers that could be pulled ike taffy. Thin drawers full of tubes of paint that seemed so much more grown up than the kind we used at school. Complicated easels and wooden boxes to hold everything.\
 (paragraph 3) My parents and friends soon saw that I had more than a passing interest in art. It came to define much of my image. Relatives gave me art-related birthday gifts. At school I became \"the kid who could draw\", a unique distinction, like \"brainiest\" or \"best athlete\"-but somehow different. A little weird, actually. I like that.\
 (paragraph 4) In my kindergarten class, we had an \"art corner\". There was an easel with a large pad of paper and poster paints. One day I was painting a picture of a red house. I can vividly recall my intense frustration because this picture just didn't look like I wanted it to.\
 (paragraph 5) As I got a little older, I began copying pictures: cartoons, comic books, and magazine illustrations. But mostly dinosaurs. I loved them. The World Book Encyclopedia published a book about the history of the earth, full of very realistic dinosaur pictures that I drew over and over again. They were in black and white and had a hazy quality to them (bad printing, I think). For a long time, even after I should have known better, I thought they were photographs of dinosaurs.\
 (paragraph 6) I found out a few years ago that these particular paintings are murals in the Chicago Field Museum. I've since seen them in person. They were painted by Charles Knight, the first and most famous painter of dinosaurs. They are still impressive, and they are in color!\
 (paragraph 7) My third-grade class wrote essays on what we wanted to be when we grew up. To me it was obvious. We read them aloud, and I told about the types of paintings I would some day try. I'd have turtles with paintbrushes tied to their backs walking around on a big sheet of paper (I got chuckles from the class and the teacher). Or I'd fill squirt guns with different colored paints and shoot at the canvas. I actually tried this with friends! Well, it sounded like a good idea.\
 (paragraph 8) One of the only discouraging childhood experiences about my artwork happened in the fourth grade. During study time I was drawing a picture. My teacher took it away and wrote an angry note home to my mother. \"David would rather be drawing pictures than doing his work!!!\" I couldn't believe it, three exclamation points. We didn't get along well for the rest of the year. School \"art classes\" were pretty uninspiring. I did my best work on textbook covers I made. Art never seemed to be taken as seriously as other subjects.\
 (paragraph 9) In the eighth grade, a big career day was held. Months before, we wrote suggestions for careers we wanted to hear about. On the big day, guest speakers from many fields came to talk. We each chose two sessions to attend, but there wasn't one that came close to an art-related field. I saw some guy talk about oceanography.\
 (paragraph 10) In high school it actually sank in that I was going to be an artist. My friends read catalogs and saw guidance counselors to pick what they'd study in college. I felt something was wrong. I already knew. I'd always known. I half expected to hear, \"No, put away those paints and choose a real career.\" My parents were excited about my choice, too. As I looked into art schools, I felt like doors were being thrown wide open. Until then my art was a private thing, but at art school I found a place where everyone was \"the kid who could draw.\"\
Which quote best expresses the main idea of paragraphs 1 and 2?\
(A) \"They had many different art supplies around the house.\" (paragraph  1)\
 (B) \"There was, and still is, something very appealing about art materials . . .\" (paragraph 1)\
 (C) \"I loved looking at all the exotic things they had for sale.\" (paragraph 2)\
 (D) \". . . paint that seemed so much more grown up than the kind we used at school.\" (paragraph 2)\

What Do Flies Think About?\
 From Ideas & Discoveries Magazine\
 \
 It seems unbelievable, but an insect’s brain is more brilliant than any supercomputer.\
 That’s why researchers are studying flies and bees to understand their cognition. Food for\
 thought . . .\
 Though it may seem like a mundane question, there is serious science behind it: Why\
 (line 5) is a common housefly able to land on a ceiling? After all, the insect flies with its feet down\
 when it’s below the ceiling, yet, in the blink of an eye, the fly is suddenly perched with feet\
 upward. The explanation for the fly’s aerial feat is important because it can reveal a lot\
 about what the insect’s brain is capable of: Regardless of how the fly manages the landing,\
 its tiny brain (which consists of only 100,000 nerve cells) has to go into high gear to carry\
 (line 10) it out. For a long time, scientists believed the flies turn around in flight much like a fighter\
 pilot performs loops. This would require them to first “visualize” a mental rotation—in\
 other words, to plan the loop beforehand.\
 It was only recently that researchers discovered how a fly actually lands on a ceiling.\
 Using a high-speed camera, they discovered that flies don’t perform a loop after all.\
 (line 15) Instead, they stretch out their front legs over their head and toward the ceiling. As soon as\
 the legs make contact with the ceiling, the fly swings its body around 180 degrees like a\
 gymnast on a horizontal bar. Then it simply attaches itself to the ceiling with all its legs.\
 This precision landing requires perfect coordination of all its muscles. The fly’s swinging\
 motion also needs to be calculated, which means information shoots through its body in\
 (line 20) the space of milliseconds. Not even an autopilot system controlled by a high-tech\
 computer could carry out such a maneuver.\
 Bees are a favorite experimental creature for researchers because they are easy to breed\
 and are considered the “Einsteins” of the insect world. These striped geniuses perform\
 intellectual feats that cannot be taken for granted, even among mammals. Bees can count,\
 (line 25) distinguish between objects like humans and dogs, recognize complex shapes, learn things,\
 navigate across great distances and remember their routes, and return to their hives and\
 tell other bees exactly where the tastiest flowers are. Compare that with the difficulties\
 humans can have when finding their way around an unfamiliar city without a map—not\
 to mention having to describe to friends the route they took. “Brain size is not necessarily\
 (line 30) an indicator of intelligence,” says bee researcher Lars Chittka at Queen Mary, University of\
 London. “Larger brains usually utilize the same circuits over and over again. This might\
 make for more detailed thinking or remembering, but it doesn’t guarantee the thoughts or\
 memories will be better.”\
 Bees are also social insects that create complex colony systems and display a high\
 (line 35) degree of social behavior. The idea of life in a group is firmly rooted in their brains—\
 which is what makes bees so interesting to brain researchers. We, too, are social creatures,\
 after all, and scientists suspect that certain neuronal circuits have changed very little over\
 the course of evolution. In other words, bee brains could provide us with information on\
 nerve connections that will help us better understand our own human nature and how we\
 (line 40) think.\
 Researchers already know that insects living in groups need to have more computing\
 power in their head. This is illustrated by the fact that all social insects have a larger brain\
 than their loner counterparts. A key factor in this discovery was a study conducted by\
 biologists at a Smithsonian lab in Panama. The country is home to a bee species that\
 (line 45) contains some members that live alone and others that form groups. The biologists\
 discovered that the loner bees also had a smaller brain. So it appears that a larger brain is\
 a consequence of group living. The same phenomenon is even more pronounced among\
 several species of locusts that begin life alone and later join up to form giant swarms: As\
 soon as they get together, their brains begin to grow by one-third. It’s likely they need to\
 (line 50) possess greater thinking capacity in order to compete with rivals in the swarm. It’s also\
 likely that flying and communicating in a swarm is more difficult than doing those things\
 alone. The biologists still don’t know how locusts get their brains to grow. The\
 explanation, should it be found, might be of interest to medical researchers looking into\
 treatments for paralysis or strokes. In any case, the researchers have found substances in\
 (line 55) the locusts’ brain that are extremely effective at killing bacteria. These substances are not\
 related to any known antibiotics, so they could possibly pave the way for new medications\
 in the future.\
 Such discoveries are definitely pointing scientists in a new direction. However,\
 practically no insect brain researcher has gone as far as Atsushi Takashima at the Tokyo\
 (line 60) Institute of Technology in Japan. Takashima has inserted electrodes into the brains of male\
 moths that he then uses as control units for a robot. Whenever the moth-machine hybrid\
 catches the scent of a female moth, it begins to search for the source. “Chemical\
 substances do not spread out uniformly in air,” Takashima explains. “So even though their\
 concentrations increase as you get closer to their source, the effects of wind and air\
 (line 65) currents make an analysis extremely difficult. But thanks to evolution, insect brains have\
 developed techniques to get around this problem.” Takashima’s research has significant\
 applications: His goal is to create robots that can sniff out explosives or dangerous\
 chemicals in the air and locate their source. One day a processor will control such robots,\
 but for now, a moth’s brain is far superior to any supercomputer on the market.\
What is the most likely reason for including information about the Smithsonian laboratory in Panama?\
(A) to emphasize the results of a major study about bees\
 (B) to illustrate why biologists should conduct bee research\
 (C) to point out that biologists still know very little about locust brains\
 (D) to provide evidence that other countries are performing studies of locust brains\

Reading Comprehension Passage C\
 \
 “The Russell-Einstein Manifesto,” signed by a group of eleven intellectuals and scientists including Bertrand Russell and Albert Einstein, was written at the height of the Cold War.\
 \
 In the tragic situation which confronts humanity, we feel that scientists should\
 assemble in conference to appraise the perils that have arisen as a result of the development\
 of weapons of mass destruction, and to discuss a resolution in the spirit of the appended\
 draft.\
 \
 (line 5) We are speaking on this occasion, not as members of this or that nation, continent, or\
 creed, but as human beings, members of the species Man, whose continued existence is in\
 doubt. The world is full of conflicts; and, overshadowing all minor conflicts, the titanic\
 struggle between Communism and anti-Communism. …\
 \
 We have to learn to think in a new way. We have to learn to ask ourselves, not what steps\
 (line 10) can be taken to give military victory to whatever group we prefer, for there no longer are\
 such steps; the question we have to ask ourselves is: what steps can be taken to prevent a\
 military contest of which the issue must be disastrous to all parties? …\
 \
 No doubt in an H-bomb (H-bomb — hydrogen bomb) war great cities would be obliterated. But this is one of the\
 minor disasters that would have to be faced. If everybody in London, New York, and\
 (line 15) Moscow were exterminated, the world might, in the course of a few centuries, recover from\
 the blow. But we now know, especially since the Bikini test, (Bikini test — reference to an American test of a hydrogen bomb conducted at the Bikini Atoll in the Pacific Ocean on March 1st, 1954. The bomb sent radioactive debris across the globe) that nuclear bombs can\
 gradually spread destruction over a very much wider area than had been supposed. …\
 \
 Many warnings have been uttered by eminent men of science and by authorities in\
 military strategy. None of them will say that the worst results are certain. What they do say\
 (line 20) is that these results are possible, and no one can be sure that they will not be realized. We\
 have not yet found that the views of experts on this question depend in any degree upon\
 their politics or prejudices. They depend only, so far as our researches have revealed, upon\
 the extent of the particular expert’s knowledge. We have found that the men who know most\
 are the most gloomy.\
 \
 (line 25) Here, then, is the problem which we present to you, stark and dreadful and inescapable:\
 Shall we put an end to the human race; or shall mankind renounce war? People will not face\
 this alternative because it is so difficult to abolish war.\
 \
 The abolition of war will demand distasteful limitations of national sovereignty. But\
 what perhaps impedes understanding of the situation more than anything else is that the\
 (line 30) term “mankind” feels vague and abstract. People scarcely realize in imagination that the\
 danger is to themselves and their children and their grandchildren, and not only to a dimly\
 apprehended humanity. They can scarcely bring themselves to grasp that they, individually,\
 and those whom they love are in imminent (imminent — about to take place) danger of perishing agonizingly. And so they\
 hope that perhaps war may be allowed to continue provided modern weapons are\
 (line 35) prohibited.\
 \
 This hope is illusory. Whatever agreements not to use H-bombs had been reached in\
 time of peace, they would no longer be considered binding in time of war, and both sides\
 would set to work to manufacture H-bombs as soon as war broke out, for, if one side\
 manufactured the bombs and the other did not, the side that manufactured them would\
 (line 40) inevitably be victorious.\
 \
 Although an agreement to renounce nuclear weapons as part of a general reduction of\
 armaments would not afford an ultimate solution, it would serve certain important purposes.\
 First: any agreement between East and West is to the good in so far as it tends to diminish\
 tension. Second: the abolition of thermo-nuclear weapons, if each side believed that the\
 (line 45) other had carried it out sincerely, would lessen the fear of a sudden attack in the style of\
 Pearl Harbour, which at present keeps both sides in a state of nervous apprehension. We\
 should, therefore, welcome such an agreement, though only as a first step.\
 \
 Most of us are not neutral in feeling, but, as human beings, we have to remember that,\
 if the issues between East and West are to be decided in any manner that can give any\
 (line 50) possible satisfaction to anybody, whether Communist or anti-Communist, whether Asian or\
 European or American, whether White or Black, then these issues must not be decided by\
 war. We should wish this to be understood, both in the East and in the West.\
 \
 There lies before us, if we choose, continual progress in happiness, knowledge, and\
 wisdom. Shall we, instead, choose death, because we cannot forget our quarrels? We\
 (line 55) appeal, as human beings, to human beings: Remember your humanity, and forget the rest.\
 If you can do so, the way lies open to a new Paradise; if you cannot, there lies before you\
 the risk of universal death.\
 \
 Resolution\
 \
 We invite this Congress, (Congress — the group of scientists who signed the Manifesto) and through it the scientists of the world and the general\
 public, to subscribe to the following resolution:\
 \
 (line 60) “In view of the fact that in any future world war nuclear weapons will certainly be\
 employed, and that such weapons threaten the continued existence of mankind, we urge\
 the Governments of the world to realize, and to acknowledge publicly, that their\
 purpose cannot be furthered by a world war, and we urge them, consequently, to find\
 peaceful means for the settlement of all matters of dispute between them.”\

Reading Comprehension Passage A\
 \
 The factory made the best centrifugal pumps in the world, and Merle Waggoner owned\
 it. He’d started it. He’d just been offered two million dollars for it by the General Forge and\
 Foundry Company. He didn’t have any stockholders and he didn’t owe a dime. He was\
 fifty-one, a widower, and he had one heir—a son. The boy’s name was Franklin. The boy\
 (line 5) was named after Benjamin Franklin.\
 \
 One Friday afternoon father and son came out of Merle’s office and into the factory.\
 They went down a factory aisle to Rudy Linberg’s lathe. (lathe — a machine on which a piece of material, such as wood or metal, is spun and shaped against a fixed\
 cutting tool)\
 \
 “Rudy,” said Merle, “the boy here’s home from college for three days, and I thought\
 maybe you and him and your boy and me might go out to the farm and shoot some clay\
 (line 10) pigeons tomorrow.”\
 \
 Rudy turned his sky-blue eyes to Merle and young Franklin. He was Merle’s age, and\
 he had the deep and narrow dignity of a man who had learned his limitations early—who\
 had never tried to go beyond them. His limitations were those of his tools, his flute and his\
 shotgun. …\
 \
 (line 15) “Let’s go ask my boy what he’s got on tomorrow,” said Rudy. It was a formality. Karl\
 always did what his father wanted him to do—did it with profound love. …\
 \
 Karl was a carbon copy of his father. He was such a good mimic of Rudy that his joints\
 seemed to ache a little with age. He seemed sobered by fifty-one years of life, though he’d\
 lived only twenty. He seemed instinctively wary of safety hazards that had been eliminated\
 (line 20) from the factory by the time he’d learned to walk. Karl stood at attention without humility,\
 just as his father had done.\
 \
 “Want to go shooting tomorrow?” said Rudy.\
 “Shoot what?” said Karl.\
 “Crows. Clay pigeons,” said Rudy. “Maybe a woodchuck.”\
 \
 (line 25)“Don’t mind,” said Karl. He nodded briefly to Merle and Franklin. “Glad to.” …\
 Rudy nodded. He examined the work in Karl’s lathe and tapped his own temple. The\
 tapping was a signal that Franklin had seen many times on hunts. It meant that Karl was\
 doing fine.\
 \
 Rudy touched Karl’s elbow lightly. It was the signal for Karl to get back to work. Rudy\
 (line 30) and Karl each held up a crooked finger and saluted with it. Franklin knew what that meant\
 too. It meant, “Good-by, I love you.” …\
 \
 Merle was sitting at his desk, his head down, when Franklin came in. He held a steel\
 plate about six inches square in his left hand. In the middle of the plate was a hole two inches\
 square. In his right hand he held a steel cube that fitted the hole exactly. …\
 \
 (line 35) Franklin sat down gingerly on a hard chair by the wall. The office hadn’t changed much\
 in the years he’d known it. It was one more factory room, with naked pipes overhead—the\
 cold ones sweaty, the hot ones dry. Wires snaked from steel box to steel box. The green walls\
 and cream trim were as rough as elephant hide in some places, with alternating coats of\
 paint and grime, paint and grime.\
 \
 (line 40) There had never been time to scrape away the layers, and barely enough time,\
 overnight, to slap on new paint. And there had never been time in which to finish the rough\
 shelves that lined the room. …\
 \
 Merle slipped the cube through the square hole once more. “Know what these are?” he\
 said.\
 \
 (line 45) “Yes, sir,” said Franklin. “They’re what Rudy Linberg had to make when he was an\
 apprentice in Sweden.”\
 The cube could be slipped through the hole in twenty-four different ways, without\
 letting the tiniest ray of light pass through with it.\
 \
 “Unbelievable skill,” said Franklin respectfully. “There aren’t craftsmen like that\
 (line 50) coming along any more.” He didn’t really feel much respect. He was simply saying what he\
 knew his father wanted to hear. The cube and the hole struck him as criminal wastes of time\
 and great bores. “Unbelievable,” he said again.\
 \
 “It’s utterly unbelievable, when you realize that Rudy didn’t make them,” said Merle\
 gravely, “when you realize what generation the man who made them belongs to.”\
 \
 (line 55) “Oh?” said Franklin. “Who did make them?”\
 \
 “Rudy’s boy, Karl,” said Merle. “A member of your generation.” He ground out his cigar\
 sadly. “He gave them to me on my last birthday. They were on my desk, boy, waiting for me\
 when I came in—right beside the ones Rudy gave me thirty-one years before.” …\
 \
 “I could have cried, boy, when I saw those two plates and those two cubes side by side,”\
 (line 60) said Merle. “Can you understand that?” he asked beseechingly. “Can you understand why\
 I’d feel like crying?” …\
 \
 “The cube of Karl’s fitted through the hole of Rudy’s!” said Merle. “They were\
 interchangeable!”\
 \
 “Gosh!” said Franklin. “I’ll be darned. Really?”\
 \
 (line 65) And now he felt like crying, because he didn’t care, couldn’t care—and would have\
 given his right arm to care. The factory whanged and banged and screeched in monstrous\
 irrelevance—Franklin’s, all Franklin’s, if he just said the word.\
 \
 “What’ll you do with it—buy a theater in New York?” said Merle abruptly.\
 \
 “Do with what, sir?” said Franklin.\
 \
 (line 70) “The money I’ll get for the factory when I sell it—the money I’ll leave to you when I’m\
 dead,” said Merle. He hit the word “dead” hard. “What’s Waggoner Pump going to be\
 converted into? Waggoner Theaters? Waggoner School of Acting? The Waggoner Home for\
 Broken-Down Actors?”\
 \
 “I—I hadn’t thought about it,” said Franklin. The idea of converting Waggoner Pump\
 (line 75) into something equally complicated hadn’t occurred to him, and appalled him now. He was\
 being asked to match his father’s passion for the factory with an equal passion for something\
 else. And Franklin had no such passion—for the theater or anything else. …\
 \
 “Don’t sell on my account,” said Franklin wretchedly.\
 \
 “On whose account would I keep it?” said Merle.\
 \
 (line 80) “Do you have to sell it today?” said Franklin, horrified.\
 \
 “Strike while the iron’s hot, I always say,” said Merle. “Today’s the day you decided to\
 be an actor, and, as luck would have it, we have an excellent offer for what I did with my\
 life.”\
 \
 “Couldn’t we wait?”\
 \
 (line 85) “For what?” said Merle. He was having a good time now.\
 \
 “Father!” cried Franklin. “For the love of heaven, father, please!” He hung his head and\
 shook it. “I don’t know what I’m doing,” he said brokenly. “I don’t know for sure what I want\
 to do yet. I’m just playing with ideas, trying to find myself. Please, father, don’t sell what\
 you’ve done with your life, don’t just throw it away because I’m not sure I want to do that\
 (line 90) with my life too! Please!” Franklin looked up. “I’m not Karl Linberg,” he said. “I can’t help\
 it. I’m sorry, but I’m not Karl Linberg.” …\

 Elizabeth Robles Ortega began working in the maquilas (foreign factories) at the age of fourteen and was blacklisted from employment after participating in independent union drives on Mexico’s northern border. She later worked as an organizer for the Service, Development, and Peace organization.\
 \
 NAFTA [North American Free Trade Agreement] has led to an increase in the workforce, as foreign industry has grown. They are reforming labor laws and our constitution to favor even more foreign investment, which is unfair against our labor rights. For example, they are now trying to take away from us free organization which was guaranteed by Mexican law. Because foreign capital is investing in Mexico and is dominating, we must have guarantees. The government is just there with its hands held out; it’s always had them out but now even more shamelessly. . . . Ecological problems are increasing. A majority of women are coming down with cancer — skin and breast cancer, leukemia, and lung and heart problems. There are daily deaths of worker women. You can see and feel the contamination of the water and the air. As soon as you arrive and start breathing the air in Acuña and Piedras Negras [border cities between the states of Coahuila and Texas], you sense the heavy air, making you feel like vomiting. . . .\

Reading Comprehension Passage A\
 \
 Screeno\
 In the following passage, Cornelius Schmidt seeks refuge from a gloomy, rainy night by going to a movie. \
 \
 …At the door [of the theater] the uniformed ticket taker gave him a card on which was \
 printed a kind of checkerboard, having in each box a number. It was obviously the old game \
 of Lotto, the object being to get five numbers which were successive either horizontally or\
 vertically or in a diagonal. In the center, amid numbered boxes, was a box entitled\
 (line 5) GRATIS; (GRATIS - free, a space that could count as any number called) the management gave this box to the audience. …\
    The theatre fell into a semi-darkness, not the movie darkness, but one in which discreet\
 lights shone on both sides of the theatre and both sides of the stage. A white and pink\
 clockface flashed on the screen. It was, in fact, like a roulette wheel, and had numbers\
 running from 1 to 100. In the center was a pointer, which suddenly began to whirl furiously \
 (line 10) about the clockface, and then slowed down, and then stopped.\
    \"Ninety-nine!\" said the businesslike yet airy young man in an authoritative voice.\
 An usher wrote down the number upon a blackboard to the right of the screen. The pointer \
 spun again, at a tremendous pace, so that it was almost a moving blur for a moment, and\
 then clarified into its arrow-like straightness. The actual wheel was, of course, in the\
 (line 15) projection room.\
    \"Fifty-four!\" said the young master of ceremonies, simulating a dramatic tone.\
    \"SCREENO!\" cried a voice from the balcony in a mocking voice, while everyone\
 laughed, for obviously no one could have SCREENO as yet.\
    \"I am sorry, ladies and gentlemen,\" said the young man in an affable (affable - friendly) voice,\" but we will \
 (line 20) have to ask you not to be humorous about this. After all, money is involved, and there has\
 been much confusion in the past because various people insisted upon trying to be\
 funny.\"…\
    The pointer was revolving again. \"Thirty-nine!\" announced the young man. The\
 audience was not yet warmed up, because too few numbers had been called for anyone to \
 (line 25) be on the verge of winning. Cornelius, however, also had this third number and was pleased \
 no little by the course of events.\
    \"Forty-nine!\" announced the young man. …\
    \"Fourteen!\" cried the young man into the microphone which made his voice even more\
 official than otherwise. Cornelius did not have the number. He assured himself that the\
 (line 30) game was a fraud, that the management was obviously not going to permit anyone to win so \
 much money and that the whole business would obviously be controlled in the projection \
 room or by arranging the numbers on the cards. There was only one more chance, a drop\
 in the ocean. He slouched back in his seat, chiding himself for his great excitement. …\
    \"Twenty-five!\" the master of ceremonies called out.\
 (line 35)    \"Twenty-five! Twenty-five!\" said Cornelius to himself, and then, finding the number on\
 his card as the fifth consecutive horizontal number, he rose in his seat and shouted:\
    \"SCREENO!\" in a too loud voice which broke, and began to issue (to issue - to exit) from his aisle,\
 tripping over the feet of the people seated near him, some of whom were solicitous (solicitous - helpful) of his\
 walk, and eager to provide good advice as he passed. The attractiveness of the winner shone\
 (line 40) in him. …\
    An usher took his card, and checked it with the numbers on the blackboard. The young\
 man came over to oversee the usher. It seemed as if something was wrong, someone\
 had miscalculated, to look at the young man. The checking was done several times.\
 Very bureaucratic, said Cornelius to himself. Recovering, as the checkup proved that\
 (line 45) Cornelius had indeed won, he shook Cornelius’s hand and the whole theatre lighted up.\
    \"Lucky fellow,\" cried the balcony voice, amusing the audience again, by the envious\
 tone in his voice. …\
    The usher arrived with the money just as the persistent balcony voice called out,\
 \"Let’s go on with the show,\" and the audience began to clap again, wishing to have its\
 (line 50) chance at the other prizes.\
    But then, as the money was delivered to the young assistant manager, and he began\
 officiously to count it out, shuffle it, and arrange it, before paying Cornelius, a hoarse and \
 disused voice cried from the balcony:\
    \"SCREENO! SCREENO!\" …\
 (line 55)   \"SCREENO!\" came the voice again, this time nearer, as the new winner approached\
 the stairs from the balcony to the orchestra. The young assistant manager and the ushers \
 looked at each other in dismay. Something had obviously gone wrong, for usually no one\
 won the jackpot; two winners was inconceivable and would lead to bankruptcy. Someone\
 was going to lose his job because of this. …\
 (line 60)   \"My name is Casper Weingarten,\" said the old man, unasked, intruding himself upon\
 the huddle of the assistant manager and the ushers. He was very nervous, very excited.\
 \"I am a musician,\" he said, but no one paid any attention to him, except Cornelius.\
    And then the young assistant manager came over to the old man and, holding the card\
 up, showed him that he had not won, that he had mistaken a 7 for a 1 because the print had\
 (line 65) been on the left-hand side. \"Perhaps you’ll win one of the other prizes,\" he said,\
 courteously, \"since you already have four numbers in a row.\" …\
    Cornelius came over to look into the matter for himself. He took the card in his hand\
 and looked at the number in question. The old man looked at him, and then turned to the\
 assistant manager, saying:\
 (line 70)   \"Give me my money! I have won!\" …\
    \"Look here,\" said Cornelius tactfully to the assistant manager, \"it seems to me that you\
 can only assume that this is a 1. The blur is too faint to make it a seven.\"\
    \"I know it is a 7,\" said the assistant manager angrily, and when he said that, Cornelius\
 recognized immediately that he was so sure because the cards had been prepared in\
 (line 75) advance to obviate the possibility of two winners of the jackpot, or even one. Seeing this,\
 Cornelius began to feel sick and angry, as he always did when confronted with fraud or\
 cheating.\
    \"All my life I’ve been cheated,\" said the old man, wringing his hands. \"Give me my\
 money.\" An usher took his arm, as if to lead him from the stage, but the assistant manager\
 (line 80) deterred him, unwilling as yet to resort to force. …\
    \"My good man,\" said the assistant manager, \"Your hard luck is not my fault, nor this\
 theatre’s responsibility. Please do not cause a disturbance. Now if both of you will leave the\
 stage, we can go on with the other prizes and with the show.\"\
    In answer, the old man sat down upon the stage, looking grotesque there, with his head\
 (line 85) turned up. \"I will sit here until I am paid,\" he said tearfully. …\
    But the audience was won over, for no one wished to lose his chance at the remaining\
 $50. There was a murmuring of voices and someone cried out:\
    \"Go home and give us a chance.\" …\
    \"Call a cop,\" said another. …\
 (line 90)   Cornelius meditated with himself for a moment and then said: \"Listen, I will give you\
 half of the jackpot. Come on before you’re arrested.\" …\
    \"No,\" said Weingarten, \"I don’t want your money. I want mine. Give me my money,\"\
 he said towards the assistant manager.\
    Cornelius considered matters with himself again and came to a decision. Easy come,\
 (line 95) easy go, he said to himself, and then he told the old musician that he could have the whole\
 jackpot. The manager protested immediately, but Cornelius took the bills from his pocket\
 and began to count them out and give them to the musician, who accepted them with\
 a guilty look and trembling hands.\
    The audience saw what was happening and applauded vigorously, not because it was\
 (line 100) genuinely moved, but because it felt that it ought to applaud. Such applause is heard at\
 public gatherings when an abstraction too vacuous (vacuous - insincere) is mentioned or tribute is paid to a man\
 long dead. The assistant manager, trying to move in on Cornelius’s credit, came over to\
 shake hands with Cornelius. Cornelius, tempted to reject the proffered hand, accepted it\
 because he wished to cause no further disturbance.\
 (line 105)   The old man had risen and come over to Cornelius.\
    \"Thank you very much for your kindness,\" he said in the estranged voice of those who\
 have been weeping or overexcited.\
    \"Not at all,\" said Cornelius formally. Both descended from the stage together. …\

Excerpt from The Call of Coney Island\
 \
 by Cynthia Overbeck Bix\
 \
 (paragraph 1) Salty ocean smells mingle with the aromas of sweet cotton candy and Nathan’s Famous hot dogs. The legendary Cyclone roller coaster lurches along its tracks—then takes a heart-stopping plunge. Riders whoop and scream with excitement. Farther down the boardwalk, the sound of a carousel starts. Patrons pitch balls at moving targets, hoping to win a prize. Welcome to Coney Island, the nation’s first truly modern amusement area.\
 \
 (paragraph 2) Located on the southern tip of Brooklyn, New York, Coney Island has been the place to go for fun for more than a century. The inspiration for amusement parks such as Coney Island sprang from an exciting event in 1893—the World’s Columbian Exposition in Chicago. It was one of the first venues where people experienced a variety of attractions in one large space. \
 \
 (paragraph 3) Visitors to Chicago gasped in wonder when they saw the fair’s “White City” spread out before them. Beautiful all-white exhibition buildings and large classical statues framed a lagoon of shimmering water. Designed to educate and inform, about a dozen grand buildings housed displays on the latest developments in transportation, machinery, agriculture, art, horticulture, and more. Most visitors had never seen the things they saw there, such as electric lights, a moving sidewalk, world-famous artwork, and moving pictures.\
 \
 (paragraph 4) While the World’s Columbian Exposition awed people with new innovations and ideas, its most popular attraction was the Midway Plaisance. Located in a separate section of the exhibition grounds, the Midway was filled with entertainment: rides, food stands, and sideshows. People could get a taste of international cultures, for example, by riding a camel through the Streets of Cairo or strolling among the thatched huts of a South Sea village. Best of all, they could ride George Ferris’s giant spinning wheel. Rising 264 feet above the Midway, this engineering marvel became the star of the fair. It was a spectacular example of what the new age of machines made possible.\
 \
 (paragraph 5) One visitor, New York showman George C. Tilyou, immediately saw potential for this new form of entertainment. Tilyou owned property on Coney Island, which already was an established beach resort with hotels, bathhouses, and restaurants. It also featured an odd collection of sideshows, food vendors, fortunetellers, and more. Tilyou decided to build an enclosed amusement park there.\
 \
 (paragraph 6) In 1897, Tilyou opened Steeplechase Park. When he was unable to buy Ferris’s wheel, he had his own version built. For 25 cents, visitors could ride Tilyou’s wheel, enjoy the Scenic Railway, or climb into a “spaceship” for a Trip to the Moon. On the Steeplechase, wooden horses carried riders along a metal racetrack from a starting gate to a finish line.\
 \
 (paragraph 7) Steeplechase Park’s huge success was partly due to another invention—electric railways. The first electric trolley line had connected Manhattan Island and Coney Island in the mid-1800s. By the turn of the 20th century, an electric train offered an even faster way to carry more people wanting to escape from the hot, crowded city.\
 \
 (paragraph 8) In the late 1800s and early 1900s, most people worked long hours and six days a week in urban factories and shops. But for a nickel fare, a city worker could afford a day’s outing to a nearby park on Sundays. Recognizing the value of giving the working class access to day trips, trolley and train companies established parks that were located at the end of a line. Travelers disembarked to enjoy simple outdoor pleasures in picnic groves and swimming pools or beaches. Eventually, merry-go-rounds, penny arcades, (penny arcades - indoor area with amusements such as games and photo booths operated by placing a coin in a slot) and even small roller coasters were added. . . .\
 \
 (paragraph 9) Part sideshow, part circus, part theme park, Coney Island set an example for amusement parks. Attractions that are so familiar today—roller coasters, water rides, fun houses, Tunnels of Love—all got their start there.\
 \
 (paragraph 10) Many amusement parks closed during the Great Depression in the 1930s or during World War II (1939–1945). Coney Island has had its ups and downs, too. Over the decades, fires and age destroyed some of the original attractions. In 2012, Superstorm Sandy wrecked the boardwalk and many of the attractions.\
 \
 (paragraph 11) In spite of all that, Coney Island has survived, and it is still operating today. It continues to offer each new generation of kids (and their parents) a chance to escape to a special world of entertainment and thrills. And from New Jersey’s Wildwood Park to California’s Pacific Park and Florida’s Walt Disney World, other amusement and theme parks have taken their cues from Coney Island. They have grown to epic proportions in their efforts to offer a world full of fun.\
Read this sentence from paragraph 11.\
 \
 And from New Jersey’s Wildwood Park to California’s Pacifific Park and Florida’s Walt Disney World, other amusement and theme parks have taken their cues from Coney Island.\

. . . When women in the Third World are raised to higher status, they do more than limit the size of their families; they also are the group most likely to take action to increase the food supply and control disease. Grassroots humanitarian organizations believe that investment in women’s enterprises is the best intervention they can make in developing nations where women do most of the farming. And UNICEF discovered during the 1970s that women were the key to implementing public health measures. Educated women support vaccination programs, understand the need for clean water supplies, and persuade family members to seek professional medical aid before an entire village becomes infected. . . .\

Passage A\
 \
 . . . I wish to go to my own words during my trial in 1964. They are as true today as they were then. I wrote: I have fought against white domination, and I have fought against black domination. I have cherished the idea of a democratic and free society in which all persons live together in harmony and with equal opportunities.\
 \
 It is an ideal which I hope to live for and to achieve. But if needs be, it is an ideal for which I am prepared to die. . . . My friends, I have no words of eloquence to offer today except to say that the remaining days of my life are in your hands. I hope you will disperse with discipline. And not a single one of you should do anything which will make other people to say that we can’t control our own people.\

 \
 Passage B\
 \
 . . . Our country and all its people have been embroiled [involved] in conflict, tension and violent struggle for decades. It is time for us to break out of the cycle of violence and break through to peace and reconciliation. The silent majority is yearning for this. The youth deserve it.\
 \
 With the steps the Government has taken it has proven its good faith and the table is laid for sensible leaders to begin talking about a new dispensation [direction], to reach an understanding by way of dialogue and discussion. \
 \
 The agenda is open and the overall aims to which we are aspiring should be acceptable to all reasonable South Africans.\
 \
 Among other things, those aims include a new, democratic constitution; universal franchise [vote]; no domination; equality before an independent judiciary; the protection of minorities as well as of individual rights; freedom of religion; a sound economy based on proven economic principles and private enterprise; dynamic programmes directed at better education, health services, housing and social conditions for all. . . .\

This is the true story of a Kenyan woman named Wangari Maathai.\
 \
 Excerpt from Seeds of Change:\
 Planting a Path to Peace\
 \
 by Jen Cullerton Johnson\
 \
 (paragraph 1) “Come,” Wangari’s mother called. She beckoned her young daughter over to a tall tree with a wide, smooth trunk and a crown of green, oval leaves.\
 \
 (paragraph 2) “Feel,” her mother whispered.\
 \
 (paragraph 3) Wangari spread her small hands over the tree’s trunk. She smoothed her fingers over the rough bark.\
 \
 (paragraph 4) “This is the mugumo,” her mother said. “It is home to many. It feeds many too.”\
 \
 (paragraph 5) She snapped off a wild fig from a low branch, and gave it to her daughter. Wangari ate the delicious fruit, just as geckos and elephants did. High in the tree, birds chirped in their nests. The branches bounced with jumping monkeys.\
 \
 (paragraph 6) “Our people, the Kikuyu of Kenya, believe that our ancestors rest in the tree’s shade,” her mother explained.\
 \
 (paragraph 7) Wangari wrapped her arms around the trunk as if hugging her great-grandmother’s spirit. She promised never to cut down the tree. . . .\
 \
 ((paragraph 8) When Wangari finished elementary school, she was eleven years old. Her mind was like a seed rooted in rich soil, ready to grow. Wangari wanted to continue her education, but to do so she would have to leave her village and move to the capital city of Nairobi. Wangari had never been farther than her valley’s ridge. She was scared.\
 \
 (paragraph 9) “Go,” her mother said. She picked up a handful of earth and placed it gently into her daughter’s hand. “Where you go, we go.” . . .\
 \
 (paragraph 10) As graduation neared, Wangari told her friends she wanted to become a biologist.\
 \
 (paragraph 11) “Not many native women become biologists,” they told her.\
 \
 (paragraph 12) “I will,” she said.\
 \
 (paragraph 13) Wangari watched sadly as her government sold more and more land to big companies that cut down forests for timber and to clear land for coffee plantations. Native trees such as cedar and acacia vanished. Without trees, birds had no place to nest. Monkeys lost their swings. Tired mothers walked miles for firewood. . . .\
 \
 (paragraph 14) When Wangari visited her village she saw that the Kikuyu custom of not chopping down the mugumo trees had been lost. No longer held in place by tree roots, the soil streamed into the rivers. The water that had been used to grow maize, bananas, and sweet potatoes turned to mud and dried up. Many families went hungry.\
 \
 (paragraph 15) Wangari could not bear to think of the land being destroyed. Now married and the mother of three children, she worried about what would happen to the mothers and children who depended on the land.\
 \
 (paragraph 16) “We must do something,” Wangari said.\
 \
 (paragraph 17) Wangari had an idea as small as a seed but as tall as a tree that reaches for the sky. “Harabee! Let’s work together!” she said to her countrywomen—mothers like her. Wangari dug deep into the soil, a seedling by her side. “We must plant trees.” . . .\
 \
 (paragraph 18) Wangari traveled to villages, towns, and cities with saplings and seeds, shovels and hoes. At each place she went, women planted rows of trees that looked like green belts across the land. Because of this they started calling themselves the Green Belt Movement.\
 \
 (paragraph 19) “We might not change the big world but we can change the landscape of the forest,” she said.\
 \
 (paragraph 20) One tree turned to ten, ten to one hundred, one hundred to one million, all the way up to thirty million planted trees. Kenya grew green again. Birds nested in new trees. Monkeys swung on branches. Rivers filled with clean water. Wild figs grew heavy in mugumo branches.\
 \
 (paragraph 21) Mothers fed their children maize, bananas, and sweet potatoes until they could eat no more.\
What idea is developed in paragraphs 4 through 7?\
(A) Wangari and her mother want to plant more trees.\
 (B) Mugumo trees are important to people and animals.\
 (C) Mugumo trees can provide shade to many people.\
 (D) Wangari and her mother think education is important.\

Tom is spending the summer on his aunt and uncle's farm. He misses his friend Petie, so he writes letters to Petie describing events on the farm.\
 \
 Excerpt from The Midnight Fox\
 by Betsy Byars\
 (paragraph 1) I had just finished writing this letter and was waiting for a minute to see if I would think of anything to add when I looked up and saw the black fox.\
 (paragraph 2) I did not believe it for a minute. It was like my eyes were playing a trick or something, because I was just sort of staring across this field, thinking about my letter, and then in the distance, where the grass was very green, I saw a fox leaping over the crest of the field. The grass moved and the fox sprang toward the movement, and then, seeing that it was just the wind that had caused the grass to move, she ran straight for the grove of trees where I was sitting\
 (paragraph 3) It was so great that I wanted it to start over again, like you can turn movie film back and see yourself repeat some fine thing you have done, and I wanted to see the fox leaping over the grass again. In all my life I have never been so excited.\
 (paragraph 4) I did not move at all, but I could hear the paper in my hand shaking, and my heart seemed to have moved up in my body and got stuck in my throat.\
 (paragraph 5) The fox came straight toward the grove of trees. She wasn't afraid, and I knew she had not seen me against the tree. I stayed absolutely still even though I felt like jumping up and screaming, \"Aunt Millie! Uncle Fred! Come see this. It's a fox, a fox!\"\
 (paragraph 6) Her steps as she crossed the field were lighter and quicker than a cat's. As she came closer I could see that her black fur was tipped with white. It was as if it were midnight and the moon were shining on her fur, frosting it. The wind parted her fur as it changed directions. Suddenly she stopped. She was ten feet away now, and with the changing of the wind she had got my scent. She looked right at me.\
 (paragraph 7) I did not move for a moment and neither did she. Her head was cocked to one side, her tail curled up, her front left foot raised. In all my life I never saw anything like that fox standing there with her pale golden eyes on me and this great black fur being blown by the wind.\
 (paragraph 8) Suddenly her nose quivered. It was such a slight movement I almost didn't see it, and then her mouth opened and I could see the pink tip of her tongue. She turned. She still was not afraid, but with a bound that was lighter than the wind-it was as if she was being blown away over the field-she was gone.\
 (paragraph 9) Still I didn't move. I couldn't. I couldn't believe that I had really seen the fox.\
 (paragraph 10) I had seen foxes before in zoos, but I was always in such a great hurry to get on to the good stuff that I was saying stupid things like, \"I want to see the go-rilllllas\", and not once had I ever really looked at a fox. Still, I could never remember seeing a black fox, not even in a zoo.\
 (paragraph 11) Also, there was a great deal of difference between seeing an animal in the zoo in front of painted fake rocks and trees and seeing one natural and free in the woods. It was like seeing a kite on the floor and then, later, seeing one up in the sky where it was supposed to be, pulling at the wind.\
 (paragraph 12) I started to pick up my pencil and write as quickly as I could, \"P.S. Today I saw a black fox.\" But I didn't. This was the most exciting thing that had happened to me, and \"P.S. Today I saw a black fox\" made it nothing. \"So what else is happening?\" Petie Burkis would probably write back. I folded my letter, put it in an envelope, and sat there.\
 (paragraph 13) I thought about this old newspaper that my dad had had in his desk drawer for years. It was orange and the headline was just one word, very big, the letters about twelve inches high. WAR! And I mean it was awesome to see that word like that, because you knew it was a word that was going to change your whole life, the whole world even. And every time I would see that newspaper, even though I wasn't even born when it was printed, I couldn't say anything for a minute or two.\
 (paragraph 14) Well, this was the way I felt right then about the black fox. I thought about a newspaper with just one word for a headline, very big, very black letters, twelve inches high. FOX! And even that did not show how awesome it had really been to me.\
How are the events described in paragraphs 6 and 7 different from earlier events?\
(A) The fox is moving through an open area.\
 (B) The fox is acting with less certainty.\
 (C) The fox is moving at a faster pace.\
 (D) The fox is aware of Tom.\

Reading Comprehension Passage C\
 \
 …Nowhere is light pollution more apparent, almost achingly so, than in satellite images\
 of the Earth from space. The continental United States seems to split in half: the eastern\
 side is brighter than the west, except for the klieg lights of Las Vegas. Highways innervate (innervate - energize)\
 America, connecting luminous dots of small towns and big cities. Across the Atlantic,\
 (line 5) Europe shimmers. Moscow is a radiant nine-pointed star. The Nile Delta glows like a\
 dandelion sprouting from mostly indigo Africa. Farther east, Hong Kong and Shanghai are\
 ablaze, and the demilitarised zone separates dark North Korea from South Korea more\
 cleanly than if the peninsula had been cleft in two. Developed society, it’s clear, is where the\
 light is.\
 \
 (line 10) Human-controlled light has pierced the night for thousands of years, long before\
 [Thomas] Edison. Campfires warmed our ancestors’ feet and cooked their meals; the\
 Harvard anthropologist Richard Wrangham argues in his book Catching Fire (2009) that\
 gathering around a flame to eat and to commune with others is, in fact, what made us\
 human. Not just fellowship but safety has long been the primary rationale for pushing back\
 (line 15) the night. ‘Evil spirits love not the smell of lamps,’ as Plato put it. Comforting, lambent (lambent — glowing or flickering with a soft radiance) \
 lamplight led us safely home by tattling on the people and potholes and animals that would\
 otherwise do us harm. By the early 17th century, residents of cities such as Paris and London\
 were admonished (admonished — warned) to keep lights burning in the windows of all houses that faced the streets,\
 as the historian A. Roger Ekirch notes in his book At Day’s Close: Night in Times Past\
 (line 20) (2005). Taxpayers funded oil lamps and candlelit lanterns for the avenues, while only\
 genteel households could afford fine beeswax or spermaceti candles; most people relied on\
 tallow, made from animal fat. …\
 \
 And even so — what price safety! A young but rapidly growing field of research suggests\
 that night-time light itself is far more dangerous than the dark. In a 2012 report, an\
 (line 25) American Medical Association committee called electric lighting a ‘man-made self-\
 experiment’ creating potentially harmful health effects. Humans, and everything else that\
 lives on this planet with us, evolved during billions of years along a reliable cycle of day and\
 night, with clear boundaries between them. Staunching the flood of artificial light can help\
 restore this divide. Our well-being, and that of our fellow creatures, might depend on us\
 (line 30) doing so — or at the very least trying. The loss of night-time darkness neglects our shared\
 past, but it might very well cut short our futures too. …\
 \
 A growing body of evidence shows that light pollution exacerbates (exacerbates — makes a situation worse),  and might directly\
 cause, cancer, obesity, and depression, the troublesome triumvirate (triumvirate — a group of three holding power) of industrialised\
 society. One of the first people to notice this correlation, at least as it applies to cancer, is\
 (line 35) Richard Stevens, a professor at the University of Connecticut, respected cancer\
 epidemiologist (epidemiologist — health professional who investigates patterns and causes of diseases), and mild insomniac. In the early 1980s, Stevens and other researchers\
 were beginning to realise there was little or no connection between diet and rising rates \
 breast cancer, contrary to what had been suspected. As Stevens puts it, it was like a light\
 bulb going on when he realised that, in fact, a light bulb going on might be a culprit. …\
 \
 (line 40) ‘Rather than falling, night, to the watchful eye, rises,’ writes Ekirch in At Day’s Close.\
 Shadows creep up lows and valleys first, then consume hillsides and houses and the tallest\
 buildings. Muted greys and deeper blues chase off the sun until finally the sky leaks no\
 colour. When we sleep according to a solar cycle, melatonin (melantonin - hormone that regulates sleep and wakefulness) production follows this\
 pattern, rising with the night. But artificial light tamps it down. This is frustratingly\
 (line 45) apparent for a special class of humans who experience sunsets every 90 minutes: astronauts.\
 \
 One of the most frequent complaints of orbital crew members is insomnia; they pop\
 sleeping pills on a regular basis, and still get only about six hours of shuteye, though they’re\
 allotted eight. Steven W. Lockley, a Harvard neuroscientist, recommends altering the light\
 to improve matters. In 2012, he advised NASA [National Aeronautics and Space\
 (line 50) Administration] engineers to change the light bulbs on the International Space Station to a\
 type of LED that can display blue-shifted light during the ‘day’, when the crew is working,\
 and red-shifted light when they need to rest. Why the difference? That crucial ganglion (ganglion — mass of nerve tissues in the brain),\
 the circadian (circadian — 24-hour biological cycle) photoreceptor, is particularly sensitive to light toward the bluish end of the\
 red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo and violet visible-light spectrum. …\
 \
 (line 55) Insomnia is hardly the worst side effect of light pollution. Shift workers, who rise with\
 the night and work awash in blue light, experience not only disrupted circadian rhythms and\
 sleep deprivation, but an increased risk of breast and prostate cancer. These cancers, which\
 require hormones to grow, are suppressed in the presence of melatonin, Stevens has shown.\
 In 2010, Stevens published a review of breast cancer sensitivity in 164 countries, and found\
 (line 60) a 30 to 50 per cent increased risk of cancer in nations with the worst light pollution, but no\
 increased prevalence of non-hormonally dependent cancers in the same populations.\
 \
 ‘Our use of electric light in the modern world is disrupting our circadian sleep and our\
 biology. There is no question about that. Does that have physiological consequences? There\
 is more and more evidence that it does,’ Stevens told me. ‘The epidemiological studies are\
 (line 65) the crudest, but the most important.’ …\
 \
 When we, in the industrialised world, do manage to turn off the lights, there are\
 measurable, beneficial effects on our circadian rhythms. In a widely reported paper last\
 summer, Kenneth Wright at the University of Colorado at Boulder took eight students\
 camping in the Rocky Mountains for two weeks. They weren’t allowed to use any artificial\
 (line 70) light after the sun went down — only the sanguine (sanguine — red) glow of campfire. After a week,\
 melatonin started to rise at sunset, peak in the middle of the night, and taper just at sunrise,\
 which Wright called a ‘remarkable’ result. ‘Internal biological time under natural light-dark\
 conditions tightly synchronises to environmental time, and in this regard, humans are\
 comparable to other animals,’ he wrote. …\
 \
 (line 75) For those of us addicted to our glowing phones and tablets, an app called F.lux can help.\
 It ‘warms’ your device’s display screen so that it shifts red in the evening, more closely\
 matching incandescent bulbs and the hue of the setting sun. Just a brief glimpse at your\
 mobile phone at bedtime is enough to expose your retinas to artificial light, so fighting such\
 a comprehensive intrusion might be an exercise in futility. But even if we can’t completely\
 (line 80) quench our thirst for light, we can all make one small gesture, which could prompt us to\
 unplug a little more. …\

Mary Wollstonecraft’s Book Dedication to M. Tallyrand-Périgord\
 \
 . . . Contending for the rights of woman, my main argument is built on this simple principle, that if she be not prepared by education to become the companion of man, she will stop the progress of knowledge and virtue; for truth must be common to all, or it will be inefficacious [ineffective] with respect to its influence on general practice. And how can woman be expected to co-operate unless she know why she ought to be virtuous? Unless freedom strengthen her reason till she comprehend her duty, and see in what manner it is connected with her real good? If children are to be educated to understand the true principle of patriotism, their mother must be a patriot; and the love of mankind, from which an orderly train of virtues spring, can only be produced by considering the moral and civil interest of mankind; but the education and situation of woman, at present, shuts her out from such investigations. . . . \

Two Days With No Phone\
 by Sarah Jane Brian\
 Experts worry that teen texting is out of control. Could you give up your phone for 48 hours? Our brave volunteers did.\
 (paragraph 1) Instead of sleeping, Kenny Alarcon, 16, often texts with his friends through the night. \"You get an urge'\" explains the teen, who lives in the Bronx in New York City. \"When I get a text, I'm itching to respond to it even if I want to sleep.\"\
 (paragraph 2) Franchesca Garcia, a high school senior from Providence, Rhode Island, has also felt the need to stay constantly connected. We asked how many texts she sent and received each day. \"I don't know . . . maybe 1,000?\" she answered. \"It's too many to count.\"\
 (paragraph 3) It probably won't surprise you that teens are texting more than ever before. Some experts are worried about how all that texting is affecting teenagers' lives.\
 \
 Teens in Trouble?\
 \
 (paragraph 4) One concern is that students might not learn correct grammar and spelling if most of the writing they do is made up of text messages. Some people also worry that because teens text so much, they don't spend enough time talking with others face-to-face. That could be hurting their relationships with friends and family.\
 (paragraph 5) Plus, all that texting (and time on social media) takes away from hours that could be spent studying, exercising, pursuing a hobby, or just relaxing.\
 (paragraph 6) Dr. Elizabeth Dowdell is a professor at Villanova University in Pennsylvania. She says that many people expect to be able to access anyone or to be accessed by anyone at any time. \"It's very appealing, especially to a middle or high school student,\" she explains. \"The problem is, there's no downtime.\" And people need downtime-especially when it comes to sleep.\
 \
 Sleep Texting\
 \
 (paragraph 7) Both Franchesca and Kenny told us that they wake up several times during the night to text. Kenny even sleeps with his phone beneath his pillow.\
 (paragraph 8) Dr. Dowdell says that it's common for teens' sleep to be interrupted by texts. Sometimes teens even send texts filled with nonsense words when they don't wake up all the way. She has been studying this trend, which she calls \"sleep texting.\"\
 (paragraph 9) Why is sleep texting a problem? \"Adolescents need a solid 8, 10, even 1 1 hours of sleep to really function and to think clearly\", reports Dr. Dowdell. If they regularly lose sleep, she adds, teens may start having trouble in school. They may become grumpy, angry, or depressed. A lack of sleep can lead to weight gain and even obesity. That's because many people turn to junk food for quick energy when they are tired.\
 \
 The 48-Hour Challenge\
 \
 (paragraph 10) According to Dr. Dowdell, teens need to learn that they can-and should-turn off their phones sometimes. So we decided to have Kenny and Franchesca do an experiment.\
 (paragraph 11) These were the rules: No phone for 48 hours. No computer or Internet either, unless it was for schoolwork. No Twitter, no Instagram.\
 (paragraph 12) Would these two teenagers be able to do it?\
 (paragraph 13) \"I think I'm going to feel really isolated\", Kenny worried. Franchesca was nervous but brave. \"I'm excited for the challenge\", she said. \"I don't know what's going to happen.\"\
 (paragraph 14) Kenny and Franchesca handed their phones to their mothers for safekeeping. The\
 challenge was on.\
 \
 The Results\
 \
 (paragraph 15) We caught up with Kenny and Franchesca after 48 phone-free hours. \"Wow, it was pure torture\", Kenny joked. But though life with no phone wasn't easy, he admitted \"it had benefits.\"\
 (paragraph 16) Sure, Kenny missed his friends, and he was sad at times. But he also felt relief from the constant texting. \"Sometimes it's teenager drama, people gossiping\" he explained. \"I felt less stressed because I didn't have to be involved.\"\
 (paragraph 17) Instead of texting, Kenny went to the gym and caught up on schoolwork. The first night, he told us, \"I slept for 18 hours!\" He also spent time sitting with his family and talking. Kenny's mom helped him with homework for the first time in two years. Said Kenny, \"I felt closer to my parents.\"\
 (paragraph 18) Franchesca had an even happier result when she put away her phone. \"I loved it!\" she said. \"I was going to the gym and hanging out with friends and playing basketball. I had a wonderful experience.\" She slept better too.\
 (paragraph 19) Franchesca decided to continue the experiment for a while. \"I think I'll be so much smarter and healthier,' she explained. \"Everybody in the world should try it.\"\
 (paragraph 20) Kenny doesn't plan to give up his phone again. But he now knows that he can live without it. Said the teen, \"It was a reality check.\"\
Which statement best expresses a main idea of the article?\
(A) \"Some experts are worried about how all that texting is affecting teenagers' lives.\" (paragraph 3)\
 (B) \"If they regularly lose sleep, she adds, teens may start having trouble in school.\" (paragraph 9)\
 (C) \"Kenny and Franchesca handed their phones to their mothers for safekeeping.\" (paragraph 14)\
 (D) \"Franchesca decided to continue the experiment for a while.\" (paragraph 19)\

Alan is on a volcano on Titan, a moon of Saturn. As the story opens, Alan is stranded on its summit in his space crawler. Luckily, he has brought along his mechanical wings.\
 \
 Excerpt from Fly for Your Life\
 \
 by John Frizell\
 \
 (paragraph 1) Alan knew there was no way back to the base and no way the crew there could help him remotely—the other crawler was down for maintenance. He could go down this side of the stream for 23 kilometers, to a flat area where the flowing liquid would spread out and be shallow enough to cross; then go back 23 kilometers to the far side of the bridge. One problem: he would definitely run out of air before he got there.\
 \
 (paragraph 2) Then Alan thought of the folded flight wings he had attached to his suit. Could he fly across the river and then walk to the base? Some quick calculations showed it wouldn’t work. He had enough air, but the battery that powered the heater of the suit he wore to stay alive on Titan was only good for an hour, not the four-hour walk it would take to reach the base. Spacewalks were usually done trailing a power cable plugged in to the suit. The cable carried power from the crawler to supplement the suit’s battery. Without the supplemental power, he would freeze solid in 10 minutes once the battery was exhausted.\
 \
 (paragraph 3) Alan knew flying the whole way was impossible. Even with Titan’s thick atmosphere and low gravity the suit made flying hard work, worse than running uphill carrying a sack of cement. No one could stay aloft for more than 10 minutes. It would be at least a half-hour flight to the base.\
 \
 (paragraph 4) He needed more than wings alone to get back alive. Then it came to him. Bolted to the side of the crawler was a squat, black cylinder containing compressed nitrogen at 200 bar, compressed Titanian atmosphere in fact, used for cleaning gunk off the crawler’s treads. Alan struggled with the bolts, working carefully in the searing cold with tools as brittle as glass. When he had the cylinder off, propped up, and pointing at the sky, he put his wings on, and then took them off, repeating the task until he could do it without thinking about it. . . .\
 \
 (paragraph 5) He pulled the power cable out of his suit’s hip socket and, before he could change his mind, gave a sharp tug on a line that he had attached to the valve of the pressure cylinder. The cylinder hissed like a giant snake, as high-pressure nitrogen blasted out, and then shot into the sky. A length of climbing rope he had attached to it went taut and snatched him into the air, where he was buffeted and tossed by the jet of nitrogen pouring down on him. It was like being caught under a breaking wave, pounded again and again by the surf. He was directly under the cylinder, using his weight and drag to keep the nozzle pointed down as the cylinder lofted him into Titan’s sky. The ground beneath, blurred by the motion, made it impossible to gauge height or direction.\
 \
 (paragraph 6) Time slowed; his shuddering world narrowed to the readout of the Titan Positioning System (TPS)—the icy moon’s equivalent of GPS. Gradually, the pounding lessened as the rate of climb shown on the readout passed its peak and began falling. Alan waited. Just before it hit zero, he cut the rope. The cylinder, relieved of his drag, flew off, dwindling to a black dot and then disappearing into the empty sky above. Now he was coasting upward, propelled by the momentum imparted to him by the nitrogen rocket. He was high in the air, but already he was slowing under the drag of the thick atmosphere. He had to get the wings on before the downward fall began. Once he started to move with some speed, he would begin to spin and never get them on. The first wing stuck and he had to take his arm out of the loops and try again. . . .\
 \
 (paragraph 7) He was gathering speed on his way down before he got the second one on. He spread his wings and rolled into a comfortable position, soaring over the moon’s dimly lit surface. The TPS showed that he was heading away from the base. He banked in an easy curve and settled on a course for home. All he had to do was hold the wings rigid and enjoy the ride. He took an occasional flap, just for fun. . . .\
 \
 (paragraph 8) As Alan glided toward the base, he flapped more often, watching the height-abovesurface and distance-to-target displays. As they unwound, an unpleasant feeling, like a trace of the frigid atmosphere outside, crept into his stomach. His elevation was dropping dangerously, with over three kilometers left to go on distance-to-target. He could see details on the surface more clearly now, because he was flying so low. . . .\
 \
 (paragraph 9) Alan forced himself to stay calm. Panic would mean disaster. He started flapping his wings faster, faster, faster. . . . He could feel himself lifting with every beat of the massive appendages. Faster, faster, faster. . . . His descent rate began to slow, but the muscles in his arms burned with pain. . . .\
 \
 (paragraph 10) Time stretched out endlessly.\
 \
 (paragraph 11) The TPS buzzed loudly in his helmet. Target. the station’s beacon was directly below him. He could barely feel his arms, but something made them stop flapping. He gratefully fell out of the sky, wrapped in a ball of pain, with barely the strength to flare his wings one last time for a soft landing. . . .\

Reading Comprehension Passage C\
 \
 …Nowhere is light pollution more apparent, almost achingly so, than in satellite images\
 of the Earth from space. The continental United States seems to split in half: the eastern\
 side is brighter than the west, except for the klieg lights of Las Vegas. Highways innervate (innervate - energize)\
 America, connecting luminous dots of small towns and big cities. Across the Atlantic,\
 (line 5) Europe shimmers. Moscow is a radiant nine-pointed star. The Nile Delta glows like a\
 dandelion sprouting from mostly indigo Africa. Farther east, Hong Kong and Shanghai are\
 ablaze, and the demilitarised zone separates dark North Korea from South Korea more\
 cleanly than if the peninsula had been cleft in two. Developed society, it’s clear, is where the\
 light is.\
 \
 (line 10) Human-controlled light has pierced the night for thousands of years, long before\
 [Thomas] Edison. Campfires warmed our ancestors’ feet and cooked their meals; the\
 Harvard anthropologist Richard Wrangham argues in his book Catching Fire (2009) that\
 gathering around a flame to eat and to commune with others is, in fact, what made us\
 human. Not just fellowship but safety has long been the primary rationale for pushing back\
 (line 15) the night. ‘Evil spirits love not the smell of lamps,’ as Plato put it. Comforting, lambent (lambent — glowing or flickering with a soft radiance) \
 lamplight led us safely home by tattling on the people and potholes and animals that would\
 otherwise do us harm. By the early 17th century, residents of cities such as Paris and London\
 were admonished (admonished — warned) to keep lights burning in the windows of all houses that faced the streets,\
 as the historian A. Roger Ekirch notes in his book At Day’s Close: Night in Times Past\
 (line 20) (2005). Taxpayers funded oil lamps and candlelit lanterns for the avenues, while only\
 genteel households could afford fine beeswax or spermaceti candles; most people relied on\
 tallow, made from animal fat. …\
 \
 And even so — what price safety! A young but rapidly growing field of research suggests\
 that night-time light itself is far more dangerous than the dark. In a 2012 report, an\
 (line 25) American Medical Association committee called electric lighting a ‘man-made self-\
 experiment’ creating potentially harmful health effects. Humans, and everything else that\
 lives on this planet with us, evolved during billions of years along a reliable cycle of day and\
 night, with clear boundaries between them. Staunching the flood of artificial light can help\
 restore this divide. Our well-being, and that of our fellow creatures, might depend on us\
 (line 30) doing so — or at the very least trying. The loss of night-time darkness neglects our shared\
 past, but it might very well cut short our futures too. …\
 \
 A growing body of evidence shows that light pollution exacerbates (exacerbates — makes a situation worse),  and might directly\
 cause, cancer, obesity, and depression, the troublesome triumvirate (triumvirate — a group of three holding power) of industrialised\
 society. One of the first people to notice this correlation, at least as it applies to cancer, is\
 (line 35) Richard Stevens, a professor at the University of Connecticut, respected cancer\
 epidemiologist (epidemiologist — health professional who investigates patterns and causes of diseases), and mild insomniac. In the early 1980s, Stevens and other researchers\
 were beginning to realise there was little or no connection between diet and rising rates \
 breast cancer, contrary to what had been suspected. As Stevens puts it, it was like a light\
 bulb going on when he realised that, in fact, a light bulb going on might be a culprit. …\
 \
 (line 40) ‘Rather than falling, night, to the watchful eye, rises,’ writes Ekirch in At Day’s Close.\
 Shadows creep up lows and valleys first, then consume hillsides and houses and the tallest\
 buildings. Muted greys and deeper blues chase off the sun until finally the sky leaks no\
 colour. When we sleep according to a solar cycle, melatonin (melantonin - hormone that regulates sleep and wakefulness) production follows this\
 pattern, rising with the night. But artificial light tamps it down. This is frustratingly\
 (line 45) apparent for a special class of humans who experience sunsets every 90 minutes: astronauts.\
 \
 One of the most frequent complaints of orbital crew members is insomnia; they pop\
 sleeping pills on a regular basis, and still get only about six hours of shuteye, though they’re\
 allotted eight. Steven W. Lockley, a Harvard neuroscientist, recommends altering the light\
 to improve matters. In 2012, he advised NASA [National Aeronautics and Space\
 (line 50) Administration] engineers to change the light bulbs on the International Space Station to a\
 type of LED that can display blue-shifted light during the ‘day’, when the crew is working,\
 and red-shifted light when they need to rest. Why the difference? That crucial ganglion (ganglion — mass of nerve tissues in the brain),\
 the circadian (circadian — 24-hour biological cycle) photoreceptor, is particularly sensitive to light toward the bluish end of the\
 red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo and violet visible-light spectrum. …\
 \
 (line 55) Insomnia is hardly the worst side effect of light pollution. Shift workers, who rise with\
 the night and work awash in blue light, experience not only disrupted circadian rhythms and\
 sleep deprivation, but an increased risk of breast and prostate cancer. These cancers, which\
 require hormones to grow, are suppressed in the presence of melatonin, Stevens has shown.\
 In 2010, Stevens published a review of breast cancer sensitivity in 164 countries, and found\
 (line 60) a 30 to 50 per cent increased risk of cancer in nations with the worst light pollution, but no\
 increased prevalence of non-hormonally dependent cancers in the same populations.\
 \
 ‘Our use of electric light in the modern world is disrupting our circadian sleep and our\
 biology. There is no question about that. Does that have physiological consequences? There\
 is more and more evidence that it does,’ Stevens told me. ‘The epidemiological studies are\
 (line 65) the crudest, but the most important.’ …\
 \
 When we, in the industrialised world, do manage to turn off the lights, there are\
 measurable, beneficial effects on our circadian rhythms. In a widely reported paper last\
 summer, Kenneth Wright at the University of Colorado at Boulder took eight students\
 camping in the Rocky Mountains for two weeks. They weren’t allowed to use any artificial\
 (line 70) light after the sun went down — only the sanguine (sanguine — red) glow of campfire. After a week,\
 melatonin started to rise at sunset, peak in the middle of the night, and taper just at sunrise,\
 which Wright called a ‘remarkable’ result. ‘Internal biological time under natural light-dark\
 conditions tightly synchronises to environmental time, and in this regard, humans are\
 comparable to other animals,’ he wrote. …\
 \
 (line 75) For those of us addicted to our glowing phones and tablets, an app called F.lux can help.\
 It ‘warms’ your device’s display screen so that it shifts red in the evening, more closely\
 matching incandescent bulbs and the hue of the setting sun. Just a brief glimpse at your\
 mobile phone at bedtime is enough to expose your retinas to artificial light, so fighting such\
 a comprehensive intrusion might be an exercise in futility. But even if we can’t completely\
 (line 80) quench our thirst for light, we can all make one small gesture, which could prompt us to\
 unplug a little more. …\

. . . History shows that wars are divided into two kinds, just and unjust. All wars that are progressive [reformist] are just, and all wars that impede [obstruct] progress are unjust. We Communists oppose all unjust wars that impede progress, but we do not oppose progressive, just wars. Not only do we Communists not oppose just wars, we actively participate in them. As for unjust wars, World War I is an instance in which both sides fought for imperialist interests; therefore the Communists of the whole world firmly opposed that war. The way to oppose a war of this kind is to do everything possible to prevent it before it breaks out and, once it breaks out, to oppose war with war, to oppose unjust war with just war, whenever possible. . . .\

Reading Comprehension Passage C\
 \
 Get That Song Outta My Head!\
 \
    The nightmare began when my husband walked into our kitchen and said, “I’ve had this\
 song stuck in my head all day …”\
    No! I thought. Don’t say it!\
    “Remember that song from the original Karate Kid movie?” he continued.\
 (line 5)   For the love of God, no!\
    “You know how it goes. ‘You’re the best around … na na na na na, na na na na. You’re\
 the best around …”\
    It was too late. Now I had an earworm — a song, melody or jingle that gets stuck in your\
 head.\
 (line 10)   The worst part? I only knew that same line. I walked around humming it for days. I tried\
 to shake it by singing along with tunes playing on my car radio while I was out running\
 errands. For a brief time, Van Halen’s “Runnin’ With the Devil” replaced it.\
    But in no time at all, that one line from “You’re the Best,” sung by Joe Esposito on the\
 The Karate Kid soundtrack, was back.\
 (line 15)   Perhaps if I heard more of the song in my head, it wouldn’t be as annoying. But just this\
 one line? Over and over and over again? It was pure torture. I needed to do something\
 drastic. I busted out that 1980s hit, “The Safety Dance” by Men Without Hats. After singing\
 it a few times, the earworm was gone.\
    I knew I’d get another one, though. About 90 percent of people experience earworms\
 (line 20) at least once a week, according to the Earworm Project run by the Music, Mind and Brain\
 group at Goldsmiths, University of London.\
    “Music lovers, specifically people who ascribe (ascribe - credit) more importance to music or people\
 who spend more time listening to music, have more frequent and longer earworm\
 episodes,” says Kelly Jakubowski, a researcher with the Earworm Project. …\
 (line 25)   To find out what causes earworms and how to get rid of them, I contacted the man\
 known as “Dr. Earworm,” James Kellaris, a marketing professor at the University of\
 Cincinnati. Certainly with a nickname like that, he would know something.\
    Kellaris began studying earworms in 1999. A former professional musician prone to\
 getting earworms himself, he eventually became a marketing professor “interested in how\
 (line 30) marketers use music to achieve various commercial goals,” he says. “It was a perfect storm\
 to create an earworms researcher.”\
    He explained to me that when we get an earworm, the tune seems to repeat itself\
 involuntarily, which is why experts consider earworms involuntary musical imagery (INMI).\
 This was exactly what “You’re the Best” had done to me.\
 (line 35)   So what, precisely, was happening in my brain when I couldn’t shake that tune?\
 Jakubowski contributed to a May 2015 study led by Nicolas Farrugia, a postdoctoral\
 researcher with the Earworm Project, that demonstrated auditory and inhibitory-related\
 areas play a role in earworms as well.\
    The researchers examined 44 healthy subjects, all between 25 and 70 years old and all\
 (line 40) participants of a past neuroimaging study run by the Cambridge Medical Research\
 Council’s Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit. These subjects took an online survey that\
 measured both the extent of their musical training and how strongly INMIs impacted them.\
 For example, the survey wanted to know how strong of a negative impact INMIs had on\
 them or if INMIs were actually helpful while they went about their everyday activities.\
 (line 45)   When they examined these participants’ brain images, one pattern in particular stuck\
 out: People who got earworms more often had a thinner right frontal cortex, which is\
 involved in inhibition, (inhibition -restraining behavior) and a thinner temporal cortex, which processes sensory stimuli like\
 sound. In other words, these people’s brains just weren’t as good at suppressing the random\
 song that might pop into their heads.\
 (line 50)   Why we get earworms, unfortunately, remains a scientific mystery. “We know that songs\
 that are ‘catchy’ — short, simple, repetitive and contain some incongruity — are most likely\
 to get stuck,” Kellaris says. Most people are more likely to get a song like “Don’t Worry, Be\
 Happy” stuck in their heads than, say, a Mahler symphony. And some things exacerbate\
 them: frequency and duration of exposure to music, worry, stress, fatigue and idleness.\
 (line 55)   Considering that my husband kept singing the snippet (snippet - short piece) while I was tired and stressed,\
 I can see why it got stuck. But my earworms have been relatively innocuous. (innocuous - harmless) Even though\
 they’re annoying, I can eventually get rid of them. Some people can’t, though.\
    Part of Kellaris’ earliest research involved mailing a questionnaire to about 1,000\
 respondents at four U.S. universities. He asked them if they’d ever had an earworm, for how\
 (line 60) long, how often it happened, how it made them feel, etc.\
    One respondent claimed to have had a song stuck in his head since 1978. This is known\
 as intrusive musical imagery (IMI), a musical obsession that’s chronic and highly distracting\
 to a person’s everyday life and work. According to Dean McKay, a psychology professor at\
 Fordham University, my short-lived earworm was nothing compared to an IMI.\
 (line 65)   But now I was concerned. Could my future earworms turn into these IMIs? Is there a\
 way to prevent this from happening?\
    McKay co-authored a June 2014 study titled “Musical obsessions: A comprehensive\
 review of neglected clinical phenomena.” For this study, McKay and other international\
 colleagues, all of whom treat obsessive-compulsive disorder, created the first\
 (line 70) comprehensive review of musical obsessions. They compiled a database of 96 case study\
 descriptions of people with severe musical obsessions — the largest compilation (compilation - collection) assembled\
 on this topic. They determined the characteristics of musical obsessions such as IMIs and\
 compared them with earworms, musical hallucinations and visual obsessional imagery.\
    The group’s research showed that IMIs can be treated by using a method known as\
 (line 75) distraction — coming up with a competing melody to think about that would get rid of the\
 IMI. That’s exactly what I had done, albeit unknowingly, when I used “The Safety Dance”\
 to stop my earworm.\
    McKay says my earworm was pesky because I knew only that one part of the song. He\
 suggests if I have just a portion of a song looping in my brain in the future, I can try another\
 (line 80) method called exposure — simply listening to the entire song. “It’s like a completion task,”\
 he says. “Once you know the whole song, then there’s no need for it to be stuck in your\
 head.”\
    Another form of distraction is to sing the song out loud, but change some of the words\
 or slightly throw off the melody. One of McKay’s patients had an IMI based on a Taylor\
 (line 85) Swift song. “We made up some other words for it,” he explains. “We messed up the melody\
 a bit, but not so much that it wasn’t recognizable as still being that song, and then it faded.”\
 McKay stresses that this is the only case he’s tried this in, so it’s not a forgone conclusion\
 this kind of distraction would work in other instances.\
    What I wanted to know was if the earworm I get today could become the IMI of\
 (line 90) tomorrow.\
    “Highly improbable,” he says.\
    “You’re the best,” I reply.\
    Oh no.\

Excerpt from Wheels of Change: How Women Rode the Bicycle to Freedom (With a Few Flat Tires Along the Way)\
 \
 by Sue Macy\
 \
 (paragraph 1) Women’s rights crusader Elizabeth Cady Stanton was in her eighties during the heyday of the bicycle, and no evidence exists to show that she actually ever rode one. But there was no better or more eloquent advocate for women and the wheel. In 1895, Stanton contributed an article to the American Wheelman celebrating this “wonderful new style of locomotion.” In the article, titled “The Era of the Bicycle,” she pointed out that cycling was increasing people’s mobility, eliminating the cost of feeding and housing horses, and encouraging the building of good roads. However, she saved her greatest praise for the bicycle’s effects on women. “The bicycle,” she wrote, “will inspire women with more courage, self-respect and self-reliance and make the next generation more vigorous of mind and of body; for feeble mothers do not produce great statesmen, scientists and scholars.”\
 \
 (paragraph 2) For all the practical benefits of the two-wheeler, the fact is that it brought about a cosmic shift in women’s private and public lives. With the rise of industry and the move from a rural to an urban economy in the 19th century, American women had become increasingly confined to their homes. Young girls could play outside, but when they matured, their freedom of movement was greatly restricted. “At sixteen years of age, I was enwrapped in the long skirts that impeded every footstep,” remembered Frances Willard, who in 1895 wrote a best-selling account of how she learned to ride abicycle at age 53. “I have detested walking and felt with a certain noble disdain that the conventions of life had cut me off from what . . . had been one of life’s sweetest joys.”\
 \
 (paragraph 3) While wealthier women were saddled with long skirts and restrictive corsets, those who were less well off worked anonymously in mills and factories. All in all, the result was the same. Except in a few instances, the public image of America was male. Politicians, soldiers, business leaders, and even the leading athletes in the new sports of baseball and football were all men. But the bicycle changed that. Suddenly, women were leaving their homes to cycle and socialize on country roads and city streets. Bicycle racers such as Louise Armaindo and Frankie Nelson had their exploits splashed all over the papers. Bicycle manufacturers, intent on mining an untapped market, showed female models in their advertisements. Thanks to the wheel, women were starting to be seen and heard in public life.\
 \
 (paragraph 4) It was not a stretch for some cyclists to see the possibility of a larger role for women in the world. When she conquered the wheel, Frances Willard was a former university president and the longtime president of the Woman’s Christian Temperance Union, which fought to prohibit the use of alcoholic beverages and to win women the right to vote. Willard saw parallels between learning to ride and learning to live. “I began to feel that myself plus the bicycle equaled myself plus the world, upon whose spinning wheel we must all learn to ride,” she wrote. “He who succeeds, or, to be more exact in handing over my experience, she who succeeds in gaining the mastery of [a bicycle], will gain the mastery of life.”\
 \
 (paragraph 5) For decades, Willard, along with Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Susan B. Anthony, and many others, had been working toward increased political and economic rights for women. Now the bicycle brought a taste of independence to women on a very personal level, and some of them took the opportunity to express their discontent with old traditions and expectations. In August 1895, a cyclist named Ann Strong caused a stir when she compared the value of a bicycle to that of a husband in the Minneapolis Tribune. “I can’t see but that a wheel is just as good company as most husbands,” she declared. “I would as lief (lief - happily) talk to one inanimate object as another; and I’d a great deal rather talk to one that can’t answer than one that won’t.” Strong then contrasted the joy of cycling with the challenges of raising a family. “You can make your wheel tidy over night,” she said, “and it never kicks off its shoes the very last minute, and never smears itself with molasses. When you are ready you can start. No little elbows are stuck in your ribs; there is no wiggling; screams at the cars or at the candy stores. You glide along, silently, smoothly, swiftly.”\
 \
 (paragraph 6) Some stated the liberating effects of the bicycle with less sarcasm. “The bicycle has brought to women a healthful, wholesome means of securing a degree of freedom and independence that no amount of discussion regarding ‘women’s rights’ would ever have produced,” wrote the L.A.W. Bulletin and Good Roads magazine in 1898. Meanwhile, Munsey’s Magazine assessed the impact of the wheel on women in a special bicycle-themed issue. “If she has ridden her bicycle into new fields, becoming in the process a new creature, it has been gradually and unconsciously,” the editors wrote.\
 \
 (paragraph 7) “She did not have to be born again in some mysterious fashion, becoming a strange creature, a ‘new woman.’ She is more like the ‘eternal feminine,’ who has taken on wings, and who is using them with an ever increasing delight in her new power.” Indeed, many bicycle companies at home and abroad did put wings on the women in their advertisements, emphasizing that they had taken flight.\
 \
 (paragraph 8) Not all publications treated the emergence of the “new woman” with the same level of approval. Some mocked her, while others just seemed baffled by her. Her new way of dressing, in bloomers or divided skirts or skirts with shortened hems, certainly disturbed the old social order, but so did her confidence and daring. These traits led commentators to worry that the differences between the sexes were being blurred, a fear that was reinforced as the four newest states—Wyoming, Colorado, Utah, and Idaho—granted women the right to vote in the 1890s. Would the bicycle help bring about a new kind of equality between men and women? Elizabeth Cady Stanton and her colleagues certainly hoped so. At any rate, the image of a female cyclist quickly became associated with efforts to win more rights for women.\

Excerpt from Humans With Amazing Senses\
 \
 When bats go out to hunt, they send out sonar signals at such high frequencies and in\
 such rapid bursts that they can hear the signals bounce off mosquitoes in midair. They\
 then zero in on the insects like laser-guided missiles. Dolphins use the same technique to\
 find their dinners. It’s called echolocation, a technique that uses sound to identify objects\
 (line 5) by the echoes they produce.\
 Fourteen-year-old Ben Underwood of Sacramento, Calif., is one of the few people\
 known to use echolocation as a primary means of navigating the world on land. There’s\
 not even a hint of light reaching his brain. His eyes are artificial, but his brain has adapted\
 to allow him to appraise his environment. He makes a “clicking” sound to communicate\
 (line 10) with objects and people around him.\
 Scientists have discovered that in the brains of the blind, the visual cortex has not\
 become useless, as they once believed. When blind people use another sense—touch or\
 hearing, for example—to substitute for sight, the brain’s visual cortex becomes active, even\
 though no images reach it from the optic nerve. Echolocation creates its own images.\
 (line 15) “I can hear that wall behind you over there. I can hear right there—the radio, and the\
 fan,” Ben says.\
 Ben says every object in his life talks to him in ways that no one else can hear\
 or understand.\
 Forty-year-old Daniel Kish of Long Beach, Calif., also uses echolocation, and has\
 (line 20) become an expert on it, founding the World Access for the Blind, an organization that\
 teaches others how to echolocate. Kish leads other blind people on mountain biking tours\
 and hikes in the wilderness, visualizing and describing the picturesque sights around him\
 through echolocating.\
 Clicking to Do Anything\
 If you listen closely to Ben or Kish, you can hear how they find their way. Ben says he\
 (line 25) can distinguish where the curbs are as he cruises his neighborhood streets.\
 He can find the pole and the backboard on a basketball goal, and tell which is which\
 by the distinctive echo each makes. Even though he can’t see the goal he’s aiming for, he\
 can sink a basket. Ben doesn’t remember how or when he began clicking, but he’s\
 developed his abilities to such an extent that aside from echolocation, he can rapidly\
 (line 30) discriminate the sounds in video games.\
 Ben lost his sight when he was 2. He was diagnosed with cancer in both eyes, and\
 when chemotherapy failed, his mother, Aquanetta Gordon, was left with one option: For\
 her son to live, both his eyes had to be surgically removed.\
 Gordon remembers her son after the operation.\
 (line 35) “He woke up and he said, ‘Mom, I can’t see anymore, I can’t see anymore.’ And I took\
 his hands and I put them on my face and I said, ‘Baby, yes, you can see.’ I said, ‘You can\
 see with your hands.’ And then I put my hand on his nose and I said, ‘You smell me? You\
 can see with your nose and your ears. . . . You can’t use your eyes anymore, but you have\
 your hands and your nose and your ears.’ ”\
 (line 40) In a house already filled with three other children, Ben’s mother decided not to treat\
 his blindness as a handicap. In school, Ben recognizes his classmates by their voices. With\
 the help of Braille books and a talking laptop computer, Ben attends the same classes as\
 sighted students.\
 Rich Mental Images, Without Visual Elements\
 Like Ben, Kish also lost his eyesight to cancer at age 1. He was raised to believe he\
 (line 45) could do pretty much anything, and he discovered clicking by accident as a child.\
 “I have mental images that are very rich, very complex. They simply do not possess\
 the visual element,” Kish says.\
 In retrieving those pictures, Kish varies the pace and volume of his clicks as he\
 walks along; and what he can tell you about an object’s qualities is sometimes\
 (line 50) astonishingly thorough.\
 If bats can distinguish prey as small as mosquitoes with echolocation, and some\
 dolphins can detect small targets a hundred yards away, what are the ultimate capabilities\
 of human beings like Ben and Kish?\
 Peter Scheifele, who studies hearing and sound production in animals and people at\
 (line 55) the University of Connecticut, analyzed samples of the clicks that Ben and Kish make.\
 “Ben clicks, looks to me like once every half second, whereas a dolphin is actually\
 making 900 clicks per second. And the bat is even faster than that,” Scheifele says.\
 The bottom line: Human beings send out sounds at much slower rates and lower\
 frequencies, so the objects people can picture with echolocation must be much larger than\
 (line 60) the ones bats and dolphins can find.\
How do lines 1–5 contribute to the understanding of the text?\
(A) by showing the widespread use of echolocation by animals\
 (B) by giving examples to explain how echolocation works\
 (C) by presenting the characteristics of animals that use echolocation\
 (D) by describing how each species uses echolocation differently\

The Diving Horse\
 by John B. Abbott, Jr.\
 \
 Fall of 1959. That was the year Fidel Castro seized power in Cuba; Alaska and Hawaii\
 joined the Union as our 49th and 50th states, respectively; and Gunsmoke reigned as the\
 top TV series. Charlton Heston collected an Academy Award for Ben-Hur, and Leon Uris’s\
 Exodus topped the reading lists. In Garwood, New Jersey, a child picked up his favorite\
 (line 5) Golden Books (Golden Books were known as Little Golden Books, a popular series of children’s books that had gold-foil bindings.) and stood outside of his parents’ apartment building, waiting for the\
 school bus. What a sight: a chubby boy in black high-top Keds, jeans, and a flannel shirt,\
 patiently waiting and watching for the bus that, when it finally did rumble down Willow\
 Avenue, passed him by. The driver didn’t think to stop, which made perfect sense since\
 her route schedule didn’t include three-year-olds—not even three-year-old me.\
 (line 10) “The bus didn’t stop for me,” I complained to my mother that day.\
 “Oh, really?” she calmly replied. Later she would say that the only surprise was\
 the age at which I wanted to start going to school. But it shouldn’t have surprised her\
 really, because as the son of a pair of avid readers, I grew up in a house abundant with\
 opportunities to read and write. Newspapers, magazines, television, and radio were\
 (line 15) always available.\
 When I finally reached school age and the bus did stop, high drama and adventure\
 made up most of my extracurricular reading. I would read and reread Classics Illustrated\
 comics, and authors like Daniel Defoe, Mark Twain, Arthur Conan Doyle, Washington\
 Irving, Edgar Rice Burroughs, and Frank W. Dixon. I also enjoyed Superman and Batman\
 (line 20) comic books and even went through a MAD magazine phase. Sometimes Mom had to\
 chase me out of the house after school to play, because I would have rather just stayed in\
 my room and read.\
 I wasn’t much on writing until I was enrolled in a Catholic school, St. Bernard’s.\
 There, the nuns were stereotypically tough but thorough educators. In third grade, I\
 (line 25) labored long and hard with Sister Mary, and while it was her thoroughness that led to my\
 discovering that I loved to write, it was a horse—the Diving Horse of Atlantic City—that\
 sparked a lifetime passion for writing.\
 At the beginning of that school year, Sister Mary had assigned to us the ubiquitous\
 essay about summer vacation. That summer, my family had taken a day trip to the\
 (line 30) original Steel Pier in Atlantic City to see the famous Diving Horse. How my parents\
 learned of the horse, I don’t know, but as a family that took all its vacations by automobile,\
 no doubt they were alert for local-yet-unusual attractions. Atlantic City must have been\
 appealing; in the 1960s, there were no casinos or nightlife per se—unless you count Frank\
 Sinatra, Jr.—but the town was mostly known for its family-oriented amusements and the\
 (line 35) tradition of Bert Parks crooning his welcome to Miss America. But for us, Bert paled in\
 comparison to the Diving Horse. So off we went in the white ’64 Pontiac to climb aboard\
 carnival rides and eat hamburgers.\
 Thinking back on that day, I remember the windburn I got on my forearms from the\
 cool salty breeze off the Atlantic—a first for me. And to this day, I can’t go to the Jersey\
 (line 40) Shore without bringing home a box of fresh saltwater taffy.\
 But above all, I remember anxiously getting bleacher seats to see the Diving Horse. As\
 we took our seats, the horse, with a fellow named Arnette Webster (The author’s recollection of the diver appears to be inaccurate. Arnette French, a woman who performed in horse diving shows, stopped performing in 1935.) (clad in a rubber wet\
 suit) on its back, was about to jump from a platform roughly 30 feet high into a pool. I\
 recall staring at the odd sight of a horse standing as calmly as you please on a platform\
 (line 45) above a pool just like the kind I swam in at my Aunt Anne and Uncle Leo’s house. To a\
 recorded drumroll and cymbal crash, Webster urged the horse forward, and the two fell\
 through space to make the biggest splash I’d ever seen—even bigger than the cannonballs\
 my uncle could make in his own pool! Wow! And then both horse and rider surfaced,\
 though for the life of me, I can’t recall how they got out of the pool.\
 (line 50) So two months later, when Sister Mary gave us the essay assignment, it was easy . . . as\
 easy as falling into a pool.\
 Looking at the Diving Horse essay some 40 years later, it’s apparent how much I must\
 have enjoyed writing about the experience. I put a lot of energy into trying to describe the\
 windburn, the taffy, and the horse, which, to my eight-year-old eyes, must have been\
 (line 55) suitable for a Valkyrie to ride. But in that essay, I did something that I imagine no other\
 child in the class did: I ended my piece with a rhetorical question. I wrote, “How would\
 you like to go to Atlantic City?”\
 Small as that detail was, Sister Mary must have noticed it. And she must have\
 encouraged me to keep writing, because with that essay, I learned something about myself.\
 (line 60) I learned that I loved to write.\
 It was at that age, as my father has confirmed, that I started to write stories, not just\
 read them. I soon took to writing as I had taken to reading. I wrote about monsters,\
 superheroes, and what could pass for a fourth-grader’s version of a mystery. Superman\
 never had it so easy foiling the best-laid plans of Lex Luthor, and my detectives—not as\
 (line 65) articulate as Sherlock Holmes, but as savvy—somehow always managed to catch the bad\
 guys and still remember to say “Thank you.”\
 Even now, when many of my workdays at Rutgers University are done, Rex Stout,\
 Mark Twain, Arthur Conan Doyle, and Superman are still often at the center of my\
 recreational reading. And when I write a mystery, whatever thread each of my various\
 (line 70) detectives picks up and untangles, something inside reminds me of the chubby kid with\
 the glasses urging the horse to “Jump! Jump!”\
 In terms of distance, it was about 30 feet. In terms of writing, it was a leap of\
 a lifetime.\
Which lines reveal a detail about a tradition of the narrator’s family?\
(A) lines 30 through 32\
 (B) lines 36 and 37\

Excerpt from Wheels of Change: How Women Rode the Bicycle to Freedom (With a Few Flat Tires Along the Way)\
 \
 by Sue Macy\
 \
 (paragraph 1) Women’s rights crusader Elizabeth Cady Stanton was in her eighties during the heyday of the bicycle, and no evidence exists to show that she actually ever rode one. But there was no better or more eloquent advocate for women and the wheel. In 1895, Stanton contributed an article to the American Wheelman celebrating this “wonderful new style of locomotion.” In the article, titled “The Era of the Bicycle,” she pointed out that cycling was increasing people’s mobility, eliminating the cost of feeding and housing horses, and encouraging the building of good roads. However, she saved her greatest praise for the bicycle’s effects on women. “The bicycle,” she wrote, “will inspire women with more courage, self-respect and self-reliance and make the next generation more vigorous of mind and of body; for feeble mothers do not produce great statesmen, scientists and scholars.”\
 \
 (paragraph 2) For all the practical benefits of the two-wheeler, the fact is that it brought about a cosmic shift in women’s private and public lives. With the rise of industry and the move from a rural to an urban economy in the 19th century, American women had become increasingly confined to their homes. Young girls could play outside, but when they matured, their freedom of movement was greatly restricted. “At sixteen years of age, I was enwrapped in the long skirts that impeded every footstep,” remembered Frances Willard, who in 1895 wrote a best-selling account of how she learned to ride abicycle at age 53. “I have detested walking and felt with a certain noble disdain that the conventions of life had cut me off from what . . . had been one of life’s sweetest joys.”\
 \
 (paragraph 3) While wealthier women were saddled with long skirts and restrictive corsets, those who were less well off worked anonymously in mills and factories. All in all, the result was the same. Except in a few instances, the public image of America was male. Politicians, soldiers, business leaders, and even the leading athletes in the new sports of baseball and football were all men. But the bicycle changed that. Suddenly, women were leaving their homes to cycle and socialize on country roads and city streets. Bicycle racers such as Louise Armaindo and Frankie Nelson had their exploits splashed all over the papers. Bicycle manufacturers, intent on mining an untapped market, showed female models in their advertisements. Thanks to the wheel, women were starting to be seen and heard in public life.\
 \
 (paragraph 4) It was not a stretch for some cyclists to see the possibility of a larger role for women in the world. When she conquered the wheel, Frances Willard was a former university president and the longtime president of the Woman’s Christian Temperance Union, which fought to prohibit the use of alcoholic beverages and to win women the right to vote. Willard saw parallels between learning to ride and learning to live. “I began to feel that myself plus the bicycle equaled myself plus the world, upon whose spinning wheel we must all learn to ride,” she wrote. “He who succeeds, or, to be more exact in handing over my experience, she who succeeds in gaining the mastery of [a bicycle], will gain the mastery of life.”\
 \
 (paragraph 5) For decades, Willard, along with Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Susan B. Anthony, and many others, had been working toward increased political and economic rights for women. Now the bicycle brought a taste of independence to women on a very personal level, and some of them took the opportunity to express their discontent with old traditions and expectations. In August 1895, a cyclist named Ann Strong caused a stir when she compared the value of a bicycle to that of a husband in the Minneapolis Tribune. “I can’t see but that a wheel is just as good company as most husbands,” she declared. “I would as lief (lief - happily) talk to one inanimate object as another; and I’d a great deal rather talk to one that can’t answer than one that won’t.” Strong then contrasted the joy of cycling with the challenges of raising a family. “You can make your wheel tidy over night,” she said, “and it never kicks off its shoes the very last minute, and never smears itself with molasses. When you are ready you can start. No little elbows are stuck in your ribs; there is no wiggling; screams at the cars or at the candy stores. You glide along, silently, smoothly, swiftly.”\
 \
 (paragraph 6) Some stated the liberating effects of the bicycle with less sarcasm. “The bicycle has brought to women a healthful, wholesome means of securing a degree of freedom and independence that no amount of discussion regarding ‘women’s rights’ would ever have produced,” wrote the L.A.W. Bulletin and Good Roads magazine in 1898. Meanwhile, Munsey’s Magazine assessed the impact of the wheel on women in a special bicycle-themed issue. “If she has ridden her bicycle into new fields, becoming in the process a new creature, it has been gradually and unconsciously,” the editors wrote.\
 \
 (paragraph 7) “She did not have to be born again in some mysterious fashion, becoming a strange creature, a ‘new woman.’ She is more like the ‘eternal feminine,’ who has taken on wings, and who is using them with an ever increasing delight in her new power.” Indeed, many bicycle companies at home and abroad did put wings on the women in their advertisements, emphasizing that they had taken flight.\
 \
 (paragraph 8) Not all publications treated the emergence of the “new woman” with the same level of approval. Some mocked her, while others just seemed baffled by her. Her new way of dressing, in bloomers or divided skirts or skirts with shortened hems, certainly disturbed the old social order, but so did her confidence and daring. These traits led commentators to worry that the differences between the sexes were being blurred, a fear that was reinforced as the four newest states—Wyoming, Colorado, Utah, and Idaho—granted women the right to vote in the 1890s. Would the bicycle help bring about a new kind of equality between men and women? Elizabeth Cady Stanton and her colleagues certainly hoped so. At any rate, the image of a female cyclist quickly became associated with efforts to win more rights for women.\
What do the details in paragraph 3 reveal about the author’s point of view?\
(A) The author thinks that clothing restrictions were less of a burden than the necessity of hard work.\
 (B) The author thinks that all women were treated unfairly regardless of economic status.\
 (C) The author thinks that poor women had more freedom of dress even though they had to work hard.\
 (D) The author thinks that the contrast between two classes of women had an effect on their advancement.\

Reading Comprehension Passage C\
 \
 …Nowhere is light pollution more apparent, almost achingly so, than in satellite images\
 of the Earth from space. The continental United States seems to split in half: the eastern\
 side is brighter than the west, except for the klieg lights of Las Vegas. Highways innervate (innervate - energize)\
 America, connecting luminous dots of small towns and big cities. Across the Atlantic,\
 (line 5) Europe shimmers. Moscow is a radiant nine-pointed star. The Nile Delta glows like a\
 dandelion sprouting from mostly indigo Africa. Farther east, Hong Kong and Shanghai are\
 ablaze, and the demilitarised zone separates dark North Korea from South Korea more\
 cleanly than if the peninsula had been cleft in two. Developed society, it’s clear, is where the\
 light is.\
 \
 (line 10) Human-controlled light has pierced the night for thousands of years, long before\
 [Thomas] Edison. Campfires warmed our ancestors’ feet and cooked their meals; the\
 Harvard anthropologist Richard Wrangham argues in his book Catching Fire (2009) that\
 gathering around a flame to eat and to commune with others is, in fact, what made us\
 human. Not just fellowship but safety has long been the primary rationale for pushing back\
 (line 15) the night. ‘Evil spirits love not the smell of lamps,’ as Plato put it. Comforting, lambent (lambent — glowing or flickering with a soft radiance) \
 lamplight led us safely home by tattling on the people and potholes and animals that would\
 otherwise do us harm. By the early 17th century, residents of cities such as Paris and London\
 were admonished (admonished — warned) to keep lights burning in the windows of all houses that faced the streets,\
 as the historian A. Roger Ekirch notes in his book At Day’s Close: Night in Times Past\
 (line 20) (2005). Taxpayers funded oil lamps and candlelit lanterns for the avenues, while only\
 genteel households could afford fine beeswax or spermaceti candles; most people relied on\
 tallow, made from animal fat. …\
 \
 And even so — what price safety! A young but rapidly growing field of research suggests\
 that night-time light itself is far more dangerous than the dark. In a 2012 report, an\
 (line 25) American Medical Association committee called electric lighting a ‘man-made self-\
 experiment’ creating potentially harmful health effects. Humans, and everything else that\
 lives on this planet with us, evolved during billions of years along a reliable cycle of day and\
 night, with clear boundaries between them. Staunching the flood of artificial light can help\
 restore this divide. Our well-being, and that of our fellow creatures, might depend on us\
 (line 30) doing so — or at the very least trying. The loss of night-time darkness neglects our shared\
 past, but it might very well cut short our futures too. …\
 \
 A growing body of evidence shows that light pollution exacerbates (exacerbates — makes a situation worse),  and might directly\
 cause, cancer, obesity, and depression, the troublesome triumvirate (triumvirate — a group of three holding power) of industrialised\
 society. One of the first people to notice this correlation, at least as it applies to cancer, is\
 (line 35) Richard Stevens, a professor at the University of Connecticut, respected cancer\
 epidemiologist (epidemiologist — health professional who investigates patterns and causes of diseases), and mild insomniac. In the early 1980s, Stevens and other researchers\
 were beginning to realise there was little or no connection between diet and rising rates \
 breast cancer, contrary to what had been suspected. As Stevens puts it, it was like a light\
 bulb going on when he realised that, in fact, a light bulb going on might be a culprit. …\
 \
 (line 40) ‘Rather than falling, night, to the watchful eye, rises,’ writes Ekirch in At Day’s Close.\
 Shadows creep up lows and valleys first, then consume hillsides and houses and the tallest\
 buildings. Muted greys and deeper blues chase off the sun until finally the sky leaks no\
 colour. When we sleep according to a solar cycle, melatonin (melantonin - hormone that regulates sleep and wakefulness) production follows this\
 pattern, rising with the night. But artificial light tamps it down. This is frustratingly\
 (line 45) apparent for a special class of humans who experience sunsets every 90 minutes: astronauts.\
 \
 One of the most frequent complaints of orbital crew members is insomnia; they pop\
 sleeping pills on a regular basis, and still get only about six hours of shuteye, though they’re\
 allotted eight. Steven W. Lockley, a Harvard neuroscientist, recommends altering the light\
 to improve matters. In 2012, he advised NASA [National Aeronautics and Space\
 (line 50) Administration] engineers to change the light bulbs on the International Space Station to a\
 type of LED that can display blue-shifted light during the ‘day’, when the crew is working,\
 and red-shifted light when they need to rest. Why the difference? That crucial ganglion (ganglion — mass of nerve tissues in the brain),\
 the circadian (circadian — 24-hour biological cycle) photoreceptor, is particularly sensitive to light toward the bluish end of the\
 red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo and violet visible-light spectrum. …\
 \
 (line 55) Insomnia is hardly the worst side effect of light pollution. Shift workers, who rise with\
 the night and work awash in blue light, experience not only disrupted circadian rhythms and\
 sleep deprivation, but an increased risk of breast and prostate cancer. These cancers, which\
 require hormones to grow, are suppressed in the presence of melatonin, Stevens has shown.\
 In 2010, Stevens published a review of breast cancer sensitivity in 164 countries, and found\
 (line 60) a 30 to 50 per cent increased risk of cancer in nations with the worst light pollution, but no\
 increased prevalence of non-hormonally dependent cancers in the same populations.\
 \
 ‘Our use of electric light in the modern world is disrupting our circadian sleep and our\
 biology. There is no question about that. Does that have physiological consequences? There\
 is more and more evidence that it does,’ Stevens told me. ‘The epidemiological studies are\
 (line 65) the crudest, but the most important.’ …\
 \
 When we, in the industrialised world, do manage to turn off the lights, there are\
 measurable, beneficial effects on our circadian rhythms. In a widely reported paper last\
 summer, Kenneth Wright at the University of Colorado at Boulder took eight students\
 camping in the Rocky Mountains for two weeks. They weren’t allowed to use any artificial\
 (line 70) light after the sun went down — only the sanguine (sanguine — red) glow of campfire. After a week,\
 melatonin started to rise at sunset, peak in the middle of the night, and taper just at sunrise,\
 which Wright called a ‘remarkable’ result. ‘Internal biological time under natural light-dark\
 conditions tightly synchronises to environmental time, and in this regard, humans are\
 comparable to other animals,’ he wrote. …\
 \
 (line 75) For those of us addicted to our glowing phones and tablets, an app called F.lux can help.\
 It ‘warms’ your device’s display screen so that it shifts red in the evening, more closely\
 matching incandescent bulbs and the hue of the setting sun. Just a brief glimpse at your\
 mobile phone at bedtime is enough to expose your retinas to artificial light, so fighting such\
 a comprehensive intrusion might be an exercise in futility. But even if we can’t completely\
 (line 80) quench our thirst for light, we can all make one small gesture, which could prompt us to\
 unplug a little more. …\

 The Rise of the Khmer Rouge\
 . . . Growing to an army of hundreds of thousands, the Khmer Rouge pushed across the countryside. They captured the capital, Phnom Penh, and took power in 1975. The soldiers, wearing black pajama-like uniforms, forced nearly 2 million Cambodians out of the cities and into the countryside. Their goal was to remove foreign influence in Cambodia and turn everyone into a simple worker or farmer.\
 During the evacuation, thousands died. Starvation and disease killed many while execution practically became a science. The Khmer Rouge death list included those in the opposing regime, intellectuals, doctors, and teachers. Even people wearing glasses were executed simply because they were considered part of the upper or business classes. Ethnic minorities such as Cham, Chinese, Vietnamese, Thai, and Lao were targeted. Not considered “pure,” many were accused of supporting American imperialism or of nothing more than living in what was called the “enemy zone.”. . .\

Reading Comprehension Passage C\
 \
 Get That Song Outta My Head!\
 \
    The nightmare began when my husband walked into our kitchen and said, “I’ve had this\
 song stuck in my head all day …”\
    No! I thought. Don’t say it!\
    “Remember that song from the original Karate Kid movie?” he continued.\
 (line 5)   For the love of God, no!\
    “You know how it goes. ‘You’re the best around … na na na na na, na na na na. You’re\
 the best around …”\
    It was too late. Now I had an earworm — a song, melody or jingle that gets stuck in your\
 head.\
 (line 10)   The worst part? I only knew that same line. I walked around humming it for days. I tried\
 to shake it by singing along with tunes playing on my car radio while I was out running\
 errands. For a brief time, Van Halen’s “Runnin’ With the Devil” replaced it.\
    But in no time at all, that one line from “You’re the Best,” sung by Joe Esposito on the\
 The Karate Kid soundtrack, was back.\
 (line 15)   Perhaps if I heard more of the song in my head, it wouldn’t be as annoying. But just this\
 one line? Over and over and over again? It was pure torture. I needed to do something\
 drastic. I busted out that 1980s hit, “The Safety Dance” by Men Without Hats. After singing\
 it a few times, the earworm was gone.\
    I knew I’d get another one, though. About 90 percent of people experience earworms\
 (line 20) at least once a week, according to the Earworm Project run by the Music, Mind and Brain\
 group at Goldsmiths, University of London.\
    “Music lovers, specifically people who ascribe (ascribe - credit) more importance to music or people\
 who spend more time listening to music, have more frequent and longer earworm\
 episodes,” says Kelly Jakubowski, a researcher with the Earworm Project. …\
 (line 25)   To find out what causes earworms and how to get rid of them, I contacted the man\
 known as “Dr. Earworm,” James Kellaris, a marketing professor at the University of\
 Cincinnati. Certainly with a nickname like that, he would know something.\
    Kellaris began studying earworms in 1999. A former professional musician prone to\
 getting earworms himself, he eventually became a marketing professor “interested in how\
 (line 30) marketers use music to achieve various commercial goals,” he says. “It was a perfect storm\
 to create an earworms researcher.”\
    He explained to me that when we get an earworm, the tune seems to repeat itself\
 involuntarily, which is why experts consider earworms involuntary musical imagery (INMI).\
 This was exactly what “You’re the Best” had done to me.\
 (line 35)   So what, precisely, was happening in my brain when I couldn’t shake that tune?\
 Jakubowski contributed to a May 2015 study led by Nicolas Farrugia, a postdoctoral\
 researcher with the Earworm Project, that demonstrated auditory and inhibitory-related\
 areas play a role in earworms as well.\
    The researchers examined 44 healthy subjects, all between 25 and 70 years old and all\
 (line 40) participants of a past neuroimaging study run by the Cambridge Medical Research\
 Council’s Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit. These subjects took an online survey that\
 measured both the extent of their musical training and how strongly INMIs impacted them.\
 For example, the survey wanted to know how strong of a negative impact INMIs had on\
 them or if INMIs were actually helpful while they went about their everyday activities.\
 (line 45)   When they examined these participants’ brain images, one pattern in particular stuck\
 out: People who got earworms more often had a thinner right frontal cortex, which is\
 involved in inhibition, (inhibition -restraining behavior) and a thinner temporal cortex, which processes sensory stimuli like\
 sound. In other words, these people’s brains just weren’t as good at suppressing the random\
 song that might pop into their heads.\
 (line 50)   Why we get earworms, unfortunately, remains a scientific mystery. “We know that songs\
 that are ‘catchy’ — short, simple, repetitive and contain some incongruity — are most likely\
 to get stuck,” Kellaris says. Most people are more likely to get a song like “Don’t Worry, Be\
 Happy” stuck in their heads than, say, a Mahler symphony. And some things exacerbate\
 them: frequency and duration of exposure to music, worry, stress, fatigue and idleness.\
 (line 55)   Considering that my husband kept singing the snippet (snippet - short piece) while I was tired and stressed,\
 I can see why it got stuck. But my earworms have been relatively innocuous. (innocuous - harmless) Even though\
 they’re annoying, I can eventually get rid of them. Some people can’t, though.\
    Part of Kellaris’ earliest research involved mailing a questionnaire to about 1,000\
 respondents at four U.S. universities. He asked them if they’d ever had an earworm, for how\
 (line 60) long, how often it happened, how it made them feel, etc.\
    One respondent claimed to have had a song stuck in his head since 1978. This is known\
 as intrusive musical imagery (IMI), a musical obsession that’s chronic and highly distracting\
 to a person’s everyday life and work. According to Dean McKay, a psychology professor at\
 Fordham University, my short-lived earworm was nothing compared to an IMI.\
 (line 65)   But now I was concerned. Could my future earworms turn into these IMIs? Is there a\
 way to prevent this from happening?\
    McKay co-authored a June 2014 study titled “Musical obsessions: A comprehensive\
 review of neglected clinical phenomena.” For this study, McKay and other international\
 colleagues, all of whom treat obsessive-compulsive disorder, created the first\
 (line 70) comprehensive review of musical obsessions. They compiled a database of 96 case study\
 descriptions of people with severe musical obsessions — the largest compilation (compilation - collection) assembled\
 on this topic. They determined the characteristics of musical obsessions such as IMIs and\
 compared them with earworms, musical hallucinations and visual obsessional imagery.\
    The group’s research showed that IMIs can be treated by using a method known as\
 (line 75) distraction — coming up with a competing melody to think about that would get rid of the\
 IMI. That’s exactly what I had done, albeit unknowingly, when I used “The Safety Dance”\
 to stop my earworm.\
    McKay says my earworm was pesky because I knew only that one part of the song. He\
 suggests if I have just a portion of a song looping in my brain in the future, I can try another\
 (line 80) method called exposure — simply listening to the entire song. “It’s like a completion task,”\
 he says. “Once you know the whole song, then there’s no need for it to be stuck in your\
 head.”\
    Another form of distraction is to sing the song out loud, but change some of the words\
 or slightly throw off the melody. One of McKay’s patients had an IMI based on a Taylor\
 (line 85) Swift song. “We made up some other words for it,” he explains. “We messed up the melody\
 a bit, but not so much that it wasn’t recognizable as still being that song, and then it faded.”\
 McKay stresses that this is the only case he’s tried this in, so it’s not a forgone conclusion\
 this kind of distraction would work in other instances.\
    What I wanted to know was if the earworm I get today could become the IMI of\
 (line 90) tomorrow.\
    “Highly improbable,” he says.\
    “You’re the best,” I reply.\
    Oh no.\

    It was too late. Now I had an earworm — a song, melody or jingle that gets stuck in your\
 head.\
 (line 10)   The worst part? I only knew that same line. I walked around humming it for days. I tried\
 to shake it by singing along with tunes playing on my car radio while I was out running\
 errands. For a brief time, Van Halen’s “Runnin’ With the Devil” replaced it.\
    But in no time at all, that one line from “You’re the Best,” sung by Joe Esposito on the\
 The Karate Kid soundtrack, was back.\
 (line 15)   Perhaps if I heard more of the song in my head, it wouldn’t be as annoying. But just this\
 one line? Over and over and over again? It was pure torture. I needed to do something\
 drastic. I busted out that 1980s hit, “The Safety Dance” by Men Without Hats. After singing\
 it a few times, the earworm was gone.\
    I knew I’d get another one, though. About 90 percent of people experience earworms\
 (line 20) at least once a week, according to the Earworm Project run by the Music, Mind and Brain\
 group at Goldsmiths, University of London.\
    “Music lovers, specifically people who ascribe (ascribe - credit) more importance to music or people\
 who spend more time listening to music, have more frequent and longer earworm\
 episodes,” says Kelly Jakubowski, a researcher with the Earworm Project. …\
 (line 25)   To find out what causes earworms and how to get rid of them, I contacted the man\
 known as “Dr. Earworm,” James Kellaris, a marketing professor at the University of\
 Cincinnati. Certainly with a nickname like that, he would know something.\
    Kellaris began studying earworms in 1999. A former professional musician prone to\
 getting earworms himself, he eventually became a marketing professor “interested in how\
 (line 30) marketers use music to achieve various commercial goals,” he says. “It was a perfect storm\
 to create an earworms researcher.”\
    He explained to me that when we get an earworm, the tune seems to repeat itself\
 involuntarily, which is why experts consider earworms involuntary musical imagery (INMI).\
 This was exactly what “You’re the Best” had done to me.\
 (line 35)   So what, precisely, was happening in my brain when I couldn’t shake that tune?\
 Jakubowski contributed to a May 2015 study led by Nicolas Farrugia, a postdoctoral\
 researcher with the Earworm Project, that demonstrated auditory and inhibitory-related\
 areas play a role in earworms as well.\
    The researchers examined 44 healthy subjects, all between 25 and 70 years old and all\
 (line 40) participants of a past neuroimaging study run by the Cambridge Medical Research\
 Council’s Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit. These subjects took an online survey that\
 measured both the extent of their musical training and how strongly INMIs impacted them.\
 For example, the survey wanted to know how strong of a negative impact INMIs had on\
 them or if INMIs were actually helpful while they went about their everyday activities.\
 (line 45)   When they examined these participants’ brain images, one pattern in particular stuck\
 out: People who got earworms more often had a thinner right frontal cortex, which is\
 involved in inhibition, (inhibition -restraining behavior) and a thinner temporal cortex, which processes sensory stimuli like\
 sound. In other words, these people’s brains just weren’t as good at suppressing the random\
 song that might pop into their heads.\
 (line 50)   Why we get earworms, unfortunately, remains a scientific mystery. “We know that songs\
 that are ‘catchy’ — short, simple, repetitive and contain some incongruity — are most likely\
 to get stuck,” Kellaris says. Most people are more likely to get a song like “Don’t Worry, Be\
 Happy” stuck in their heads than, say, a Mahler symphony. And some things exacerbate\
 them: frequency and duration of exposure to music, worry, stress, fatigue and idleness.\
 (line 55)   Considering that my husband kept singing the snippet (snippet - short piece) while I was tired and stressed,\
 I can see why it got stuck. But my earworms have been relatively innocuous. (innocuous - harmless) Even though\
 they’re annoying, I can eventually get rid of them. Some people can’t, though.\
    Part of Kellaris’ earliest research involved mailing a questionnaire to about 1,000\
 respondents at four U.S. universities. He asked them if they’d ever had an earworm, for how\
 (line 60) long, how often it happened, how it made them feel, etc.\
    One respondent claimed to have had a song stuck in his head since 1978. This is known\
 as intrusive musical imagery (IMI), a musical obsession that’s chronic and highly distracting\
 to a person’s everyday life and work. According to Dean McKay, a psychology professor at\
 Fordham University, my short-lived earworm was nothing compared to an IMI.\
 (line 65)   But now I was concerned. Could my future earworms turn into these IMIs? Is there a\
 way to prevent this from happening?\
    McKay co-authored a June 2014 study titled “Musical obsessions: A comprehensive\
 review of neglected clinical phenomena.” For this study, McKay and other international\
 colleagues, all of whom treat obsessive-compulsive disorder, created the first\
 (line 70) comprehensive review of musical obsessions. They compiled a database of 96 case study\
 descriptions of people with severe musical obsessions — the largest compilation (compilation - collection) assembled\
 on this topic. They determined the characteristics of musical obsessions such as IMIs and\
 compared them with earworms, musical hallucinations and visual obsessional imagery.\
    The group’s research showed that IMIs can be treated by using a method known as\
 (line 75) distraction — coming up with a competing melody to think about that would get rid of the\
 IMI. That’s exactly what I had done, albeit unknowingly, when I used “The Safety Dance”\
 to stop my earworm.\
    McKay says my earworm was pesky because I knew only that one part of the song. He\
 suggests if I have just a portion of a song looping in my brain in the future, I can try another\
 (line 80) method called exposure — simply listening to the entire song. “It’s like a completion task,”\
 he says. “Once you know the whole song, then there’s no need for it to be stuck in your\
 head.”\
    Another form of distraction is to sing the song out loud, but change some of the words\
 or slightly throw off the melody. One of McKay’s patients had an IMI based on a Taylor\
 (line 85) Swift song. “We made up some other words for it,” he explains. “We messed up the melody\
 a bit, but not so much that it wasn’t recognizable as still being that song, and then it faded.”\
 McKay stresses that this is the only case he’s tried this in, so it’s not a forgone conclusion\
 this kind of distraction would work in other instances.\
    What I wanted to know was if the earworm I get today could become the IMI of\
 (line 90) tomorrow.\
    “Highly improbable,” he says.\
    “You’re the best,” I reply.\
    Oh no.\

 Excerpt from Waste Not, Want Not\
 by Teresa Bateman\
 \
 (paragraph 1) My mother believed in using things up. We always squeezed the toothpaste tube until it was as sharp as a razor, and we cleaned our plates, even when it was liver-andonions\
 night. . . .\
 \
 (paragraph 2) Mom’s frugality was legendary. She could make one chicken come back in a dozen meals as variously disguised leftovers. Her favorite saying was “waste not, want not.” Josh and I weren’t sure what that meant, but it probably explained why Mom was into recycling long before it became popular. It also explained why the “Affair of the Hat,” as it later became known, was so strange.\
 \
 (paragraph 3) The Hat deserved capital letters. It was about three feet across, made of green straw and covered with big plastic daisies, two red peonies, and an orange bow. I might have said it was “dog ugly,” except that wouldn’t sit well with our dog, Mutt.\
 \
 (paragraph 4) Great-aunt Marjorie had given The Hat to Mother on one of her visits to our farm. It was supposed to keep the sun off Mother’s delicate complexion while enhancing her rural beauty (whatever that meant). . . .\
 \
 (paragraph 5) When Aunt Marjorie returned to the city, Josh and I held our breath to see what would happen to The Hat. We could see that Mom’s thrifty nature and fashion sense were in pitched battle. She couldn’t justify throwing The Hat away—it was nearly new and had a lot of use left in it—but neither could she stomach wearing it. She tried pulling off the daisies and peonies, but they were stuck on tight, as were the perky orange ribbons that held The Hat in place. She’d have to find some other solution.\
 \
 (paragraph 6) One day Josh and I came down to breakfast and noticed that The Hat was missing from the hook by the door. We looked at each other, then scouted the house. It wasn’t hard to spot. Mother had installed it in the parlor as a lampshade.\
 \
 (paragraph 7) Our parakeet, Pete, chirped inquiringly from his cage as Josh and I decided to see how The Hat looked in full lampshade glory. We pulled the chain.\
 \
 (paragraph 8 ) Pete tweeted once, then dropped like a stone from his perch. We ran to his cage, and Josh suggested mouth-to-beak resuscitation. Then we glanced over at the lamp. The light shining through the peonies made them look like two big red eyes glaring at you. No wonder Pete had fainted. We plucked The Hat from the lamp and went to tell Mom. Reluctantly she hung it back up on the hook by the door. . . .\
 \
 (paragraph 9) The next morning she headed out the door, The Hat filled to the brim with turkey feed. Josh and I watched as Mother approached the turkeys scavenging in the barnyard. The minute those turkeys sighted The Hat, they ran gobbling toward the barn door and dived in a panic into the haystack. Mom dumped the turkey feed in the barnyard and\
 walked back to the house, her shoulders drooping. . . .\
 \
 (paragraph 10) She threw The Hat to the floor, raised her foot, and screamed, “THIS HAT IS FOR THE BIRDS!” Josh and I stepped back, waiting for her foot to come crashing down.\
 \
 (paragraph 11) “It is not for the birds,” Josh blurted. \"They hate it!”\
 \
 (paragraph 12) It was as though time stood still. Then we heard a strange sound. Mother was laughing!\
 \
 (paragraph 13) We shook our heads. She’d finally gone over the edge—there she stood, one foot in the air, laughing like a hysterical flamingo.\
 \
 (paragraph 14) Then she put her foot down . . . on the floor. She picked up The Hat and headed upstairs where we heard boxes being shuffled around in the attic. . .\
 \
 (paragraph 15) When she came down, she was dragging a body. It was wearing Grandpa’s old overalls, Uncle Paul’s flannel shirt, and the shoes Josh had outgrown last year. Its head was a flour sack, stuffed full of straw from an old tick, and on that head perched The Hat.\
 \
 tick = mattress\
 \
 (paragraph 16) Mom hauled the stuffed body outside and set it up on a post in the middle of the cornfield. And that’s where it stayed.\
 \
 (paragraph 17) Our corn crop that year was particularly good. For some reason the birds steered clear of our fields and raided the neighbors’ instead. Maybe it had something to do with our scarecrow, I don’t know. All I do know is that from then on, we rarely saw crows on our property except during the month of June.\
 \
 (paragraph 16) That’s when Great-aunt Marjorie comes to visit.\

The Diving Horse\
 by John B. Abbott, Jr.\
 \
 Fall of 1959. That was the year Fidel Castro seized power in Cuba; Alaska and Hawaii\
 joined the Union as our 49th and 50th states, respectively; and Gunsmoke reigned as the\
 top TV series. Charlton Heston collected an Academy Award for Ben-Hur, and Leon Uris’s\
 Exodus topped the reading lists. In Garwood, New Jersey, a child picked up his favorite\
 (line 5) Golden Books (Golden Books were known as Little Golden Books, a popular series of children’s books that had gold-foil bindings.) and stood outside of his parents’ apartment building, waiting for the\
 school bus. What a sight: a chubby boy in black high-top Keds, jeans, and a flannel shirt,\
 patiently waiting and watching for the bus that, when it finally did rumble down Willow\
 Avenue, passed him by. The driver didn’t think to stop, which made perfect sense since\
 her route schedule didn’t include three-year-olds—not even three-year-old me.\
 (line 10) “The bus didn’t stop for me,” I complained to my mother that day.\
 “Oh, really?” she calmly replied. Later she would say that the only surprise was\
 the age at which I wanted to start going to school. But it shouldn’t have surprised her\
 really, because as the son of a pair of avid readers, I grew up in a house abundant with\
 opportunities to read and write. Newspapers, magazines, television, and radio were\
 (line 15) always available.\
 When I finally reached school age and the bus did stop, high drama and adventure\
 made up most of my extracurricular reading. I would read and reread Classics Illustrated\
 comics, and authors like Daniel Defoe, Mark Twain, Arthur Conan Doyle, Washington\
 Irving, Edgar Rice Burroughs, and Frank W. Dixon. I also enjoyed Superman and Batman\
 (line 20) comic books and even went through a MAD magazine phase. Sometimes Mom had to\
 chase me out of the house after school to play, because I would have rather just stayed in\
 my room and read.\
 I wasn’t much on writing until I was enrolled in a Catholic school, St. Bernard’s.\
 There, the nuns were stereotypically tough but thorough educators. In third grade, I\
 (line 25) labored long and hard with Sister Mary, and while it was her thoroughness that led to my\
 discovering that I loved to write, it was a horse—the Diving Horse of Atlantic City—that\
 sparked a lifetime passion for writing.\
 At the beginning of that school year, Sister Mary had assigned to us the ubiquitous\
 essay about summer vacation. That summer, my family had taken a day trip to the\
 (line 30) original Steel Pier in Atlantic City to see the famous Diving Horse. How my parents\
 learned of the horse, I don’t know, but as a family that took all its vacations by automobile,\
 no doubt they were alert for local-yet-unusual attractions. Atlantic City must have been\
 appealing; in the 1960s, there were no casinos or nightlife per se—unless you count Frank\
 Sinatra, Jr.—but the town was mostly known for its family-oriented amusements and the\
 (line 35) tradition of Bert Parks crooning his welcome to Miss America. But for us, Bert paled in\
 comparison to the Diving Horse. So off we went in the white ’64 Pontiac to climb aboard\
 carnival rides and eat hamburgers.\
 Thinking back on that day, I remember the windburn I got on my forearms from the\
 cool salty breeze off the Atlantic—a first for me. And to this day, I can’t go to the Jersey\
 (line 40) Shore without bringing home a box of fresh saltwater taffy.\
 But above all, I remember anxiously getting bleacher seats to see the Diving Horse. As\
 we took our seats, the horse, with a fellow named Arnette Webster (The author’s recollection of the diver appears to be inaccurate. Arnette French, a woman who performed in horse diving shows, stopped performing in 1935.) (clad in a rubber wet\
 suit) on its back, was about to jump from a platform roughly 30 feet high into a pool. I\
 recall staring at the odd sight of a horse standing as calmly as you please on a platform\
 (line 45) above a pool just like the kind I swam in at my Aunt Anne and Uncle Leo’s house. To a\
 recorded drumroll and cymbal crash, Webster urged the horse forward, and the two fell\
 through space to make the biggest splash I’d ever seen—even bigger than the cannonballs\
 my uncle could make in his own pool! Wow! And then both horse and rider surfaced,\
 though for the life of me, I can’t recall how they got out of the pool.\
 (line 50) So two months later, when Sister Mary gave us the essay assignment, it was easy . . . as\
 easy as falling into a pool.\
 Looking at the Diving Horse essay some 40 years later, it’s apparent how much I must\
 have enjoyed writing about the experience. I put a lot of energy into trying to describe the\
 windburn, the taffy, and the horse, which, to my eight-year-old eyes, must have been\
 (line 55) suitable for a Valkyrie to ride. But in that essay, I did something that I imagine no other\
 child in the class did: I ended my piece with a rhetorical question. I wrote, “How would\
 you like to go to Atlantic City?”\
 Small as that detail was, Sister Mary must have noticed it. And she must have\
 encouraged me to keep writing, because with that essay, I learned something about myself.\
 (line 60) I learned that I loved to write.\
 It was at that age, as my father has confirmed, that I started to write stories, not just\
 read them. I soon took to writing as I had taken to reading. I wrote about monsters,\
 superheroes, and what could pass for a fourth-grader’s version of a mystery. Superman\
 never had it so easy foiling the best-laid plans of Lex Luthor, and my detectives—not as\
 (line 65) articulate as Sherlock Holmes, but as savvy—somehow always managed to catch the bad\
 guys and still remember to say “Thank you.”\
 Even now, when many of my workdays at Rutgers University are done, Rex Stout,\
 Mark Twain, Arthur Conan Doyle, and Superman are still often at the center of my\
 recreational reading. And when I write a mystery, whatever thread each of my various\
 (line 70) detectives picks up and untangles, something inside reminds me of the chubby kid with\
 the glasses urging the horse to “Jump! Jump!”\
 In terms of distance, it was about 30 feet. In terms of writing, it was a leap of\
 a lifetime.\
What do lines 61 through 71 reveal about the narrator?\
(A) He currently writes books for children.\
 (B) He is reminded of his childhood when he reads.\
 (C) He imitates the style of the authors he admires.\
 (D) He continues to have many of the same literary influences.\

Excerpt from Wheels of Change: How Women Rode the Bicycle to Freedom (With a Few Flat Tires Along the Way)\
 \
 by Sue Macy\
 \
 (paragraph 1) Women’s rights crusader Elizabeth Cady Stanton was in her eighties during the heyday of the bicycle, and no evidence exists to show that she actually ever rode one. But there was no better or more eloquent advocate for women and the wheel. In 1895, Stanton contributed an article to the American Wheelman celebrating this “wonderful new style of locomotion.” In the article, titled “The Era of the Bicycle,” she pointed out that cycling was increasing people’s mobility, eliminating the cost of feeding and housing horses, and encouraging the building of good roads. However, she saved her greatest praise for the bicycle’s effects on women. “The bicycle,” she wrote, “will inspire women with more courage, self-respect and self-reliance and make the next generation more vigorous of mind and of body; for feeble mothers do not produce great statesmen, scientists and scholars.”\
 \
 (paragraph 2) For all the practical benefits of the two-wheeler, the fact is that it brought about a cosmic shift in women’s private and public lives. With the rise of industry and the move from a rural to an urban economy in the 19th century, American women had become increasingly confined to their homes. Young girls could play outside, but when they matured, their freedom of movement was greatly restricted. “At sixteen years of age, I was enwrapped in the long skirts that impeded every footstep,” remembered Frances Willard, who in 1895 wrote a best-selling account of how she learned to ride abicycle at age 53. “I have detested walking and felt with a certain noble disdain that the conventions of life had cut me off from what . . . had been one of life’s sweetest joys.”\
 \
 (paragraph 3) While wealthier women were saddled with long skirts and restrictive corsets, those who were less well off worked anonymously in mills and factories. All in all, the result was the same. Except in a few instances, the public image of America was male. Politicians, soldiers, business leaders, and even the leading athletes in the new sports of baseball and football were all men. But the bicycle changed that. Suddenly, women were leaving their homes to cycle and socialize on country roads and city streets. Bicycle racers such as Louise Armaindo and Frankie Nelson had their exploits splashed all over the papers. Bicycle manufacturers, intent on mining an untapped market, showed female models in their advertisements. Thanks to the wheel, women were starting to be seen and heard in public life.\
 \
 (paragraph 4) It was not a stretch for some cyclists to see the possibility of a larger role for women in the world. When she conquered the wheel, Frances Willard was a former university president and the longtime president of the Woman’s Christian Temperance Union, which fought to prohibit the use of alcoholic beverages and to win women the right to vote. Willard saw parallels between learning to ride and learning to live. “I began to feel that myself plus the bicycle equaled myself plus the world, upon whose spinning wheel we must all learn to ride,” she wrote. “He who succeeds, or, to be more exact in handing over my experience, she who succeeds in gaining the mastery of [a bicycle], will gain the mastery of life.”\
 \
 (paragraph 5) For decades, Willard, along with Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Susan B. Anthony, and many others, had been working toward increased political and economic rights for women. Now the bicycle brought a taste of independence to women on a very personal level, and some of them took the opportunity to express their discontent with old traditions and expectations. In August 1895, a cyclist named Ann Strong caused a stir when she compared the value of a bicycle to that of a husband in the Minneapolis Tribune. “I can’t see but that a wheel is just as good company as most husbands,” she declared. “I would as lief (lief - happily) talk to one inanimate object as another; and I’d a great deal rather talk to one that can’t answer than one that won’t.” Strong then contrasted the joy of cycling with the challenges of raising a family. “You can make your wheel tidy over night,” she said, “and it never kicks off its shoes the very last minute, and never smears itself with molasses. When you are ready you can start. No little elbows are stuck in your ribs; there is no wiggling; screams at the cars or at the candy stores. You glide along, silently, smoothly, swiftly.”\
 \
 (paragraph 6) Some stated the liberating effects of the bicycle with less sarcasm. “The bicycle has brought to women a healthful, wholesome means of securing a degree of freedom and independence that no amount of discussion regarding ‘women’s rights’ would ever have produced,” wrote the L.A.W. Bulletin and Good Roads magazine in 1898. Meanwhile, Munsey’s Magazine assessed the impact of the wheel on women in a special bicycle-themed issue. “If she has ridden her bicycle into new fields, becoming in the process a new creature, it has been gradually and unconsciously,” the editors wrote.\
 \
 (paragraph 7) “She did not have to be born again in some mysterious fashion, becoming a strange creature, a ‘new woman.’ She is more like the ‘eternal feminine,’ who has taken on wings, and who is using them with an ever increasing delight in her new power.” Indeed, many bicycle companies at home and abroad did put wings on the women in their advertisements, emphasizing that they had taken flight.\
 \
 (paragraph 8) Not all publications treated the emergence of the “new woman” with the same level of approval. Some mocked her, while others just seemed baffled by her. Her new way of dressing, in bloomers or divided skirts or skirts with shortened hems, certainly disturbed the old social order, but so did her confidence and daring. These traits led commentators to worry that the differences between the sexes were being blurred, a fear that was reinforced as the four newest states—Wyoming, Colorado, Utah, and Idaho—granted women the right to vote in the 1890s. Would the bicycle help bring about a new kind of equality between men and women? Elizabeth Cady Stanton and her colleagues certainly hoped so. At any rate, the image of a female cyclist quickly became associated with efforts to win more rights for women.\
A distinction the author makes between Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Frances Willard is that only\
(A) Stanton wrote in favor of women riding bicycles\
 (B) Willard was actually known to ride a bicycle\
 (C) Stanton was actually criticized for riding a bicycle\
 (D) Willard was a true spokeswoman for the bicycle\

Excerpt from “The Beadwork” from American Indian Stories\
 \
 by Zitkala-Sa\
 \
 (paragraph 1) Soon after breakfast mother sometimes began her beadwork. On a bright, clear day, she pulled out the wooden pegs that pinned the skirt of our wigwam to the ground, and rolled the canvas part way up on its frame of slender poles. Then the cool morning breezes swept freely through our dwelling, now and then wafting the perfume of sweet grasses from the newly burnt prairie.\
 \
 (paragraph 2) Untying the long tasseled strings that bound a small brown buckskin bag, my mother spread upon a mat beside her bunches of colored beads, just as an artist arranges the paints upon his palette. On a lapboard she smoothed out a double sheet of soft white buckskin; and drawing from a beaded case that hung on the left of her wide\
 belt a long, narrow blade, she trimmed the buckskin into shape. Often she worked upon small moccasins for her small daughter. Then I became intensely interested in her designing. With a proud, beaming face, I watched her work. In imagination, I saw myself walking in a new pair of snugly fitting moccasins. I felt the envious eyes of my playmates upon the pretty red beads decorating my feet.\
 \
 (paragraph 3) Close beside my mother I sat on a rug, with a scrap of buckskin in one hand and an awl in the other. This was the beginning of my practical observation lessons in the art of beadwork. From a skein of finely twisted threads of silvery sinews my mother pulled out a single one. With an awl she pierced the buckskin, and skillfully threaded it with the white sinew. Picking up the tiny beads one by one, she strung them with the point of her thread, always twisting it carefully after every stitch. . . .\
 \
 (paragraph 4) Always after these confining lessons I was wild with surplus spirits, and found joyous relief in running loose in the open again. Many a summer afternoon a party of four or five of my playmates roamed over the hills with me. We each carried a light, sharpened rod about four feet long, with which we pried up certain sweet roots. When we had eaten all the choice roots we chanced upon, we shouldered our rods and strayed off into patches of a stalky plant under whose yellow blossoms we found little crystal drops of gum. Drop by drop we gathered this nature’s rock-candy, until each of us could boast of a lump the size of a small bird’s egg. Soon satiated (satiated - completely satisfied) with its woody flavor, we tossed away our gum, to return again to the sweet roots.\
 \
 (paragraph 5) I remember well how we used to exchange our necklaces, beaded belts, and sometimes even our moccasins. We pretended to offer them as gifts to one another. We delighted in impersonating our own mothers. We talked of things we had heard them say in their conversations. We imitated their various manners, even to the inflection of their voices. In the lap of the prairie we seated ourselves upon our feet, and leaning our painted cheeks in the palms of our hands, we rested our elbows on our knees, and bent forward as old women were most accustomed to do.\
 \
 (paragraph 6) While one was telling of some heroic deed recently done by a near relative, the rest of us listened attentively, and exclaimed in undertones “Han! han!” (yes! yes!) whenever the speaker paused for breath, or sometimes for our sympathy. As the discourse became more thrilling, according to our ideas, we raised our voices in these interjections. In these impersonations our parents were led to say only those things that were in common favor.\
 \
 (paragraph 7) No matter how exciting a tale we might be rehearsing, the mere shifting of a cloud shadow in the landscape near by was sufficient to change our impulses; and soon we were all chasing the great shadows that played among the hills. We shouted and whooped in the chase; laughing and calling to one another, we were like little sportive nymphs (sportive nymphs - playful creatures of the woods) on that Dakota sea of rolling green.\
 \
 (paragraph 8) On one occasion I forgot the cloud shadow in a strange notion to catch up with my own shadow. Standing straight and still, I began to glide after it, putting out one foot cautiously. When, with the greatest care, I set my foot in advance of myself, my shadow crept onward too. Then again I tried it; this time with the other foot. Still again my shadow escaped me. I began to run; and away flew my shadow, always just a step beyond me. Faster and faster I ran, setting my teeth and clenching my fists, determined to overtake my own fleet shadow. But ever swifter it glided before me while I was growing breathless and hot. Slackening my speed, I was greatly vexed that my shadow should check its pace also. Daring it to the utmost, as I thought, I sat down upon a rock imbedded in the hillside.\
 \
 (paragraph 9) So! my shadow had the impudence (impudence - nerve) to sit down beside me!\
 \
 (paragraph 10) Now my comrades caught up with me, and began to ask why I was running away so fast.\
 \
 (paragraph 11) “Oh, I was chasing my shadow! Didn’t you ever do that?” I inquired, surprised that they should not understand.\
 \
 (paragraph 12) They planted their moccasined feet firmly upon my shadow to stay it, and I arose. Again my shadow slipped away, and moved as often as I did. Then we gave up trying to catch my shadow.\
 \
 (paragraph 13) Before this peculiar experience, I have no distinct memory of having recognized any vital bond between myself and my shadow. I never gave it an afterthought.\
 \
 (paragraph 14) Returning to our borrowed belts and trinkets, we rambled homeward. That evening, as on other evenings, I went to sleep over my legends.\
What is the meaning of “discourse” as used in paragraph 6?\
(A) brief remark\
 (B) spoken story\
 (C) response to someone\
 (D) disagreement between people\

Excerpt from Gregor and the Sheep\
 by Toby Rosenstrauch\
 \
 (paragraph 1) In a valley in the highlands of Scotland, there once lived a young tenant farmer, Gregor, and his widowed mother. Although they worked hard, they could never accumulate enough money to buy the flock of sheep they longed to have, for their small parcel of land produced only modest amounts of oats and barley. To make matters worse, MacTavish, the owner of this and many other crofts, always found reasons not to pay the farmers all they had earned. . . .\
 \
 crofts = small farms\
 \
 (paragraph 2) When he opened the door each morning and looked out, he saw MacTavish’s house on top of a mountain, a magnificent stone mansion surrounded by red, pink, and violet rhododendrons. Gregor often climbed the slope and stood outside the iron gates, wondering what fine furnishings and delicious foods lay within. Neighbors claimed that MacTavish owned many houses and even kept a chest of gems under his bed. As Gregor, his mother, and their neighbors grew gaunt and pale with hard work and not enough food, they railed against MacTavish, who had swindled all of them at one time or another.\
 \
 swindled = cheated or tricked\
 \
 (paragraph 3) One day, as Gregor listened to the bagpipe music that drifted from the open windows of MacTavish’s mansion, he had an idea. That night, when his mother was asleep, he emptied the jug that held their money and counted it. After putting back a few coins for food, he put the rest in his pocket. The next morning, he hurried to the market, where he went from farmer to farmer, asking the prices of sheep for sale. Gregor found many handsome animals, but they were all too expensive. When he reached a stall with scrawny and sickly sheep, the owner beckoned to him. . . .\
 \
 (paragraph 4) Gregor shook his head and began to walk away. The man grabbed his sleeve and whispered in his ear, “This one will make her owner rich!” Gregor examined the old sheep with spindly legs and dirty, unkempt wool—the worst of the lot. “If she will make me rich,” said Gregor, “how is it that she has not done so for you?”\
 \
 (paragraph 5) The man paused, thinking. “I have not had her long enough!”\
 \
 (paragraph 6) “Nonsense,” said Gregor, but he gave the man his money and led the pitiful animal home.\
 \
 (paragraph 7) When his mother saw what he had bought with their money, she burst into tears. “My foolish son, what have you done? Now we will starve, and no one will help us!”\
 \
 (paragraph 8) “Do as I say, Mother, and we will be rich. I promise.”\
 \
 (paragraph 9) She wanted to believe him. Wiping her eyes with her ragged sleeve, she asked what he wanted her to do.\
 \
 (paragraph 10) “Go to market and tell everyone that your son has a sheep that will make whoever owns her rich,” said Gregor. . . .\
 \
 (paragraph 11) One morning, a carriage arrived. Two servants opened the door and a stout, welldressed gentleman emerged. His Tartan kilt was made of the finest wool, his ascot was pure silk, and his shoes had silver buckles. On his fat fingers were eight gold rings, and his pomaded hair glistened in the sun. It was MacTavish!\
 \
 Tartan kilt = traditional clothing worn by Scottish Highlanders\
 \
 ascot = a type of necktie\
 \
 (paragraph 12) Gregor bowed as if to royalty. MacTavish looked at him sternly. “I have come to rid you of the unfortunate sheep that everyone is talking about,” said MacTavish, opening his sporran. “I can pay your price and I will have her, even though she has done nothing for you, I see.” MacTavish sneered at Gregor.\
 \
 sporran = a small bag worn at the waist for holding personal items\
 \
 (paragraph 13) Gregor hugged Dear One. “I will not sell her to you!”\
 \
 (paragraph 14) ”At that, MacTavish, whose servants were helping him into his carriage, turned and marched back. “I will pay anything,” he said. “Name the price.”\
 \
 (paragraph 15) Gregor was ready. “That,” he said, pointing up to the mansion above them. “I will have the dwelling and everything in it—furniture, utensils, even the chest of gems under your bed.”\
 \
 (paragraph 16) “Done,” said MacTavish.\
 \
 (paragraph 17) The next day, Gregor and his mother moved into the mansion that had once belonged to MacTavish, and MacTavish brought Dear One to the market so that all might see he could indeed own anything he wanted. Then MacTavish and the sheep rode away in his carriage to another of his houses in a valley beyond the mountains.\
 \
 (paragraph 18) After months had passed and the sheep had done nothing to increase MacTavish’s riches, he realized he had been swindled. Furious beyond speech, he returned to the mansion, but Gregor would not open the gates.\
 \
 (paragraph 19) “I have been cheated!” shouted MacTavish.\
 \
 (paragraph 20) “You have not been cheated,” said Gregor. “I was the owner of the sheep, and she has made me rich, hasn’t she?”\
 \
 (paragraph 21) “Yes, but . . . ,” sputtered MacTavish.\
 \
 (paragraph 22) “Then you got what you paid for.” Gregor turned and walked away.\
 \
 (paragraph 23) Soon afterward, Gregor sold the chest of gems and bought the huge flock of sheep he and his mother had always wanted. He shared the rest of his fortune with the other poor families of the valley who had been cheated by MacTavish.\
How do paragraphs 1 and 23 relate to each other?\
(A) They show the change in Gregor’s life during the story.\
 (B) They show what Gregor has learned in the story.\
 (C) They show how MacTavish changes in the story.\
 (D) They show the growth of MacTavish’s fortune during the story.\

Talking with Artists:\
 David Wiesner\
 compiled and edited by Pat Cummings\
 MY STORY\
 (paragraph 1) I think that I always knew I wanted to become an artist. I can't remember a time when I wasn't drawing and painting pictures. My oldest sister and my brother were artistic, and watching them draw fascinated me. They had many different art supplies around the house. There was, and still is, something very appealing about art materials: Boxes of pastels, with incredibly colored, thin, square sticks, fitting snugly into the slots in their trays. Little ink bottles with rubber stoppers and pens with interchangeable metal tips. The look, smell, and feel of rich black ink going onto bright white paper in broad, flat strokes or thin, sharp lines. I found this captivating.\
 (paragraph 2) In our town, the housepaint and wallpaper store also sold art supplies. I loved looking at all the exotic things they had for sale. Sandpaper blocks to sharpen pencils. Rows of numbered pencils, and erasers that could be pulled ike taffy. Thin drawers full of tubes of paint that seemed so much more grown up than the kind we used at school. Complicated easels and wooden boxes to hold everything.\
 (paragraph 3) My parents and friends soon saw that I had more than a passing interest in art. It came to define much of my image. Relatives gave me art-related birthday gifts. At school I became \"the kid who could draw\", a unique distinction, like \"brainiest\" or \"best athlete\"-but somehow different. A little weird, actually. I like that.\
 (paragraph 4) In my kindergarten class, we had an \"art corner\". There was an easel with a large pad of paper and poster paints. One day I was painting a picture of a red house. I can vividly recall my intense frustration because this picture just didn't look like I wanted it to.\
 (paragraph 5) As I got a little older, I began copying pictures: cartoons, comic books, and magazine illustrations. But mostly dinosaurs. I loved them. The World Book Encyclopedia published a book about the history of the earth, full of very realistic dinosaur pictures that I drew over and over again. They were in black and white and had a hazy quality to them (bad printing, I think). For a long time, even after I should have known better, I thought they were photographs of dinosaurs.\
 (paragraph 6) I found out a few years ago that these particular paintings are murals in the Chicago Field Museum. I've since seen them in person. They were painted by Charles Knight, the first and most famous painter of dinosaurs. They are still impressive, and they are in color!\
 (paragraph 7) My third-grade class wrote essays on what we wanted to be when we grew up. To me it was obvious. We read them aloud, and I told about the types of paintings I would some day try. I'd have turtles with paintbrushes tied to their backs walking around on a big sheet of paper (I got chuckles from the class and the teacher). Or I'd fill squirt guns with different colored paints and shoot at the canvas. I actually tried this with friends! Well, it sounded like a good idea.\
 (paragraph 8) One of the only discouraging childhood experiences about my artwork happened in the fourth grade. During study time I was drawing a picture. My teacher took it away and wrote an angry note home to my mother. \"David would rather be drawing pictures than doing his work!!!\" I couldn't believe it, three exclamation points. We didn't get along well for the rest of the year. School \"art classes\" were pretty uninspiring. I did my best work on textbook covers I made. Art never seemed to be taken as seriously as other subjects.\
 (paragraph 9) In the eighth grade, a big career day was held. Months before, we wrote suggestions for careers we wanted to hear about. On the big day, guest speakers from many fields came to talk. We each chose two sessions to attend, but there wasn't one that came close to an art-related field. I saw some guy talk about oceanography.\
 (paragraph 10) In high school it actually sank in that I was going to be an artist. My friends read catalogs and saw guidance counselors to pick what they'd study in college. I felt something was wrong. I already knew. I'd always known. I half expected to hear, \"No, put away those paints and choose a real career.\" My parents were excited about my choice, too. As I looked into art schools, I felt like doors were being thrown wide open. Until then my art was a private thing, but at art school I found a place where everyone was \"the kid who could draw.\"\
Which statement describes how Wiesner's parents felt about his college and career plans?\
(A) His parents encouraged him to go to art school, yet they worried about his future career choices.\
 (B) His parents allowed him to choose his career, and they were glad he decided to go to art school.\
 (C) His parents knew he would rather do art than school work, and they accepted his choices.\
 (D) His parents raised him to be an artist, so they expected him to choose the right school.\

In this excerpt, the author talks about introducing her chickens to her yard.\
 \
 Excerpt from Birdology\
 by Sy Montgomery\
 \
 At first I was afraid they’d run away or become lost. We had a cozy, secure home for\
 them prepared in the bottom storey of our barn, with wood shavings scattered over the\
 dirt floor, a dispenser for fresh water, a trough for chick feed, some low perches made\
 from dowels, and a hay-lined nest box made from an old rabbit hutch left over from one\
 (line 5) of the barn’s previous denizens, in which they could lay future eggs. Chickens need to be\
 closed in safe at night to protect them from predators, but by day we didn’t want to\
 confine them; we wanted to give them free run of the yard. But how could they possibly\
 understand that they lived here now? Once we let them out, would they even recognize\
 their space in the barn and go back in it? When I was in seventh grade, my family had\
 (line 10) moved, once again, to a new house; my first afternoon there I literally got lost in my own\
 backyard. Could these six-week-old chicks be expected to know better?\
 Gretchen assured me there would be no problem. “Leave them in the pen for\
 twenty-four hours,” she told me. “Then you can let them out and they’ll stick around.\
 They’ll go back in again when it starts to get dark.”\
 (line 15) “But how do they know?” I asked.\
 “They just do,” she said. “Chickens just know these things.”\
 When before dusk, I found them all perched calmly back in their coop, I saw that\
 Gretchen was right.\
 In fact, chickens know many things, some from the moment they are born. Like all\
 (line 20) members of the order in which they are classified, the Galliformes, or game birds,\
 just-hatched baby chickens are astonishingly mature and mobile, able to walk, peck, and\
 run only hours after leaving the egg.\
 This developmental strategy is called precocial. Like its opposite, the altricial strategy\
 (employed by creatures such as humans and songbirds, who are born naked and helpless),\
 (line 25) the precocial strategy was sculpted by eons of adaptation to food and predators. If your\
 nest is on the ground, as most game birds’ are, it’s a good idea to get your babies out of\
 there as quickly as possible before someone comes to eat them. So newborn game birds\
 hatch covered in down, eyes open, and leave the nest within twenty-four hours. (An\
 Australian game bird known as the malleefowl begins its life by digging its way out of\
 (line 30) its nest of decaying vegetation and walks off into the bush without ever even meeting\
 either parent.)\
 That chickens hatch from the egg knowing how to walk, run, peck, and scratch has an\
 odd consequence: many people take this as further evidence they are stupid. But instinct is\
 not stupidity. (After all, Einstein was born knowing how to suckle.) Nor does instinct\
 (line 35) preclude learning. Unlike my disoriented seventh-grade self (and I have not improved\
 much since), young chickens have a great capacity for spatial learning. In scientific\
 experiments, researchers have trained days-old chicks to find hidden food using both\
 distant and nearby landmarks as cues. Italian researchers demonstrated that at the tender\
 age of fifteen days, after just a week’s training to find hidden food in the middle of their\
 (line 40) cage, chicks can correctly calculate the center of a given environment—even in the\
 absence of distinctive landmarks. Even more astonishing, they can do it in spaces they\
 have never seen before, whether the area be circular, square, or triangular. How? The\
 chicks “probably relied on a visual estimate of these distances from their actual positions,”\
 wrote University of Padova researcher L. Tommasi and co-authors in the Journal of\
 (line 45) Comparative Physiology, ”. . . [but] it remains to be determined how the chicks actually\
 measure distances in the task.”\
 We never determined how our first chickens knew their new home was theirs, either.\
 We never knew how they managed to discern the boundaries of our property. But they\
 did. At first, they liked to stay near the coop. But as they grew, they took to following me\
 (line 50) everywhere, first cheeping like the tinkling of little bells, later clucking in animated adult\
 discussion. If I was hanging out the laundry, they would check what was in the laundry\
 basket. If I was weeding a flower bed, they would join me, raking the soil with their\
 strong, scaly feet, then stepping backward to see what was revealed. (Whenever I worked\
 with soil, I suspect they assumed I was digging for worms.) When my husband, Howard,\
 (line 55) and I would eat at the picnic table under the big silver maple, the Ladies would\
 accompany us. When my father-in-law came to help my husband build a pen for\
 Christopher Hogwood, then still a piglet, the Ladies milled underfoot to supervise every\
 move. The hens were clearly interested in the project, pecking at the shiny nails, standing\
 tall to better observe the use of tools, clucking a running commentary all the while. Before\
 (line 60) this experience, Howard’s dad would have been the first to say that he didn’t think\
 chickens were that smart. But they changed his mind. After a few hours I noticed he\
 began to address them. Picking up a hammer they were examining, he might say, directly\
 and respectfully, “Pardon me, Ladies”—as if he were speaking to my mother-in-law and\
 me when we got in the way.\
 (line 65) But when their human friends are inside, and this is much of the time, the Ladies\
 explore on their own. A chicken can move as fast as nine miles an hour, which can take\
 you pretty far, and ours are free to go anywhere they like. But ours have intuited our\
 property lines and confine their travels to its boundaries. They have never crossed the\
 street. And for years, they never hopped across the low stone wall separating our land\
 (line 70) from that of our closest neighbor. That came later—and it was not the result of any\
 physical change in the landscape, but the outcome of a change in social relationships\
 among their human friends.\
Read lines 36 through 42 from the passage.\
 In scientific experiments, researchers have trained days-old chicks to find hidden food using both distant and nearby landmarks as cues. Italian researchers demonstrated that at the tender age of fifteen days, after just a week’s training to find hidden food in the middle of their cage, chicks can correctly calculate the center of a given environment—even in the absence of distinctive landmarks. Even more astonishing, they can do it in spaces they have never seen before, whether the area be circular, square, or triangular.\
 How do these lines relate to lines 59 through 64?\
(A) Lines 36 through 42 express an opinion, and lines 59 through 64 provide support.\
 (B) Lines 36 through 42 identify why something happens, and lines 59 through 64 describe what happens.\
 (C) Lines 36 through 42 present facts, and lines 59 through 64 support the facts with a personal experience.\
 (D) Lines 36 through 42 provide a comparison, and lines 59 through 64 provide evidence for the comparison.\

In West Africa, the Harmattan is a dry, dust-filled wind.\
 Excerpt from A Scrap and a Robe\
 by Myrina D. McCullough\
 \
 (paragraph 1) The West African Harmattan whipped up a billow of dust. Suddenly Sali spied a scrap of glorious orange damask cloth turning in the hot wind like a flame. She followed as it danced down a street she didn’t know very well. She skipped over holes and skirted people on chairs.\
 damask = woven cloth\
 skirted = went around\
 (paragraph 2) All at once the wind died down, and the scrap settled gently on the scratchy, sandy road.\
 (paragraph 3) Sali picked up the cloth and gazed at it with admiring eyes. She turned it this way and that in the sun and imagined herself in a flowing dlokibani made of such cloth. This was a treasure, and she would take it home for her little wooden doll. It would surely make a lovely headpiece for that lucky one.\
 dlokibani or dloki = a long dress\
 (paragraph 4) Sali wandered back the way she had come, slowly now. At the corner of the street, she passed the table vendor, who was selling his dusty packets of tea and two-pill packs of aspirin. She passed Ami’s mother, roasting peanuts and selling them by the handful. She turned onto the larger street and passed a plastic-goods store that displayed rows and rows of brightly colored plastic plates, bowls, and teapots. She glanced into the next shop and then stopped short. It was a fabric shop! There on the high counter was an entire bolt of the same wondrous cloth she held in her hand!\
 (paragraph 5) The next day Sali went back to the cloth shop. She stood near the door and watched the storekeeper. He measured and cut, as one person after another bought pieces of cloth. Her prized orange damask was back on a high shelf to the rear of the store.\
 (paragraph 6) After a while the shopkeeper looked at Sali. “Why do you stand so long at the door?” he asked.\
 (paragraph 7) Sali took a deep breath and said, “I would like to help you in the store till I could earn enough of that orange cloth to make a dlokibani for myself.”\
 (paragraph 8) The orange fabric glowed in a shaft of light from the uncovered bulb at the back of the store.\
 (paragraph 9) “That is very special and expensive cloth, little one,” the shopkeeper told her.\
 (paragraph 10) So she swept the courtyard and threw away scraps. She pushed big rolls of cloth back and forth. She ran to buy cough drops and peanuts and kola nuts for the shopkeeper. For days and days she worked.\
 (paragraph 11) Finally, one day the store owner lifted down the lustrous roll of orange damask and measured out several yards. “You’ve worked well for this cloth, Sali,” he said. “I thank you.”\
 (paragraph 12) Sali rushed straight home with her treasure. Carefully she placed the cloth in her trunk.\
 (paragraph 13) But how was she to get the dloki made? Sali did not know how to sew. Her mother always had their clothes made by a tailor who sat in a tiny shop several blocks from their house.\
 (paragraph 14) Sali went and stood under a tree near the tailor’s shop. She watched the people come and go. The tailor would whip out his measuring tape and see how tall the people were, how fat they were, how long their arms, how short their necks. He measured every part of them.\
 (paragraph 15) After almost a whole day the tailor noticed Sali.\
 (paragraph 16) “What are you doing there, little girl?” he asked.\
 (paragraph 17) “I have some beautiful cloth,” she said, “and I want it sewn into a dlokibani. Could I work for you to pay for sewing it into a robe for me?”\
 (paragraph 18) The tailor agreed. Once again Sali worked for days and days. She swept and fanned the tea coals and held scissors and brought thread. At last, the tailor said, “Bring me the cloth, Sali.”\
 (paragraph 19) Sali rushed home and brought back the satiny, shining cloth. She also brought her doll, its small head still neatly wrapped in the swatch of orange. The tailor took his tape and measured Sali, shoulder to ankle, shoulder to elbow, left shoulder to right shoulder. Then he started cutting the billows of orange fabric.\
 (paragraph 20) The next day was an important holiday called Tabaski. Drums were beating in many neighborhoods. Relatives and friends came to visit Sali’s family. Sali slipped quietly away. Soon her mother missed her. “Now where has Sali gone?” she exclaimed.\
 (paragraph 21) Just then, Sali walked in, proudly wearing a beautiful orange dloki with a matching headdress. In her arms she carried her doll, dressed exactly as she was!\

(A) They foreshadow an important choice Sali makes later.\
 (B) They explain why Sali wants a new dress.\
 (C) They show the actions Sali takes to solve her problem.\
 (D) They provide details about the shopkeeper and the tailor.\

 Excerpt from The Woolly-Puff Rescue\
 \
 by Sue Mozena\
 \
 (paragraph 1) Wendy and Alex stared at the strange ﬂower at their feet. Dozens of them bloomed in this remote corner of the ﬁeld.\
 \
 (paragraph 2) Wendy bent down for a closer look. “We shouldn’t name them until we’re sure we can keep them,” she warned. “But I like Woolly-Puffs. They look just like ﬂeecy rainbows.”\
 \
 (paragraph 3) As tempting as it was to pet the feathery yellow-orange-red-purple-blue petals, neither of them did. Instead, Wendy pulled protective gloves from her belt pack.\
 \
 (paragraph 4) On the asteroid-based colony of New Harmony, even twelve-year-old pioneers knew the number one rule for living in outer space: don’t touch or taste or sniff anything that hasn’t been tested.\
 \
 (paragraph 5) “Where do you think they came from?” Wendy asked. With a gentle tug, she freed a Woolly-Puff from the thin layer of soil, sealed it in a clear bag.\
 \
 (paragraph 6) “They were probably in the compost shipment that brought these naggers,” Alex muttered. He slapped at one of the whining insects that swarmed around him looking for exposed skin to bite.\
 \
 compost = a mixture of decaying plants used to improve the soil in a garden\
 \
 (paragraph 7) New Harmony depended on shipments of rich compost from nearby planets to build up its soil. Usually the compost was treated before it arrived, but one shipment had been accidentally overlooked. The whining gnat-like insects the colonists called “naggers” had hatched from the compost. Without any natural enemies in this new world, the insects had multiplied, becoming a constant torment to the colonists.\
 \
 (paragraph 8) After turning in their discovery, Wendy settled on a stone bench in front of the New Harmony laboratory. Alex paced, then sat. “Poor Woolly-Puff,” Wendy said. “What if it’s just a weedy ﬂower?”\
 \
 (paragraph 9) “Then one living plant and a packet of seeds will be sent to the Botany Preserve on Mars,” Alex answered, rubbing a hot-pink nagger welt just above his elbow.\
 \
 (paragraph 10) Wendy gingerly held the extra bouquet she had picked, in case the Woolly-Puffs proved keepers. “And the rest of the plants—”\
 \
 (paragraph 11) “The rest will be pulled up and destroyed to make room for ‘useful’ plants,” Alex said.\
 \
 (paragraph 12) The colony of New Harmony did have ﬂowers. It just didn’t have a lot of room. Woolly-Puffs would have to be more than pretty if they wanted to grow here.\
 \
 (paragraph 13) The two friends scrambled to attention as the lab door opened.\
 \
 (paragraph 14) “Your Woolly-Puff isn’t toxic,” Professor Raglin said. His smile faded as he went on. “The sap is thick and sticky, but we already have a good glue. The stems are too woody and the leaves too bristly to eat. And the petals, well, they smell funny. Not ﬂowery at all. More like moldy lemons. I’m sorry, but I’ll have to make my report to the council this afternoon. The good news is that they seem to grow only in the soil where you found them, so it won’t be hard to get rid of them.”\
 \
 (paragraph 15) “At least they’re not poison,” Wendy said after Professor Raglin had left. She hugged her colorful, fuzzy bouquet. She had to admit they did smell funny. “Mayor Murphy will probably send a reclaim crew out after the council meeting.” She sighed. “I wish the council would let us adopt one, like a pet.”\
 \
 (paragraph 16) “Fat chance,” Alex said. He blew at a pair of naggers trying to land on his knee. “Shoo! For harmless gnats, these bugs sure are pests.”\
 \
 (paragraph 17) “Yeah.” Wendy reached up to scratch the end of her nose. Then she realized something. The end of her nose itched simply because that’s what the ends of noses do sometimes. The naggers weren’t biting her. They weren’t even landing on her.\
 \
 (paragraph 18) “We’re going to the council meeting,” she announced.\
 \
 (paragraph 19) That afternoon, when the council members emerged from the community center, Alex and Wendy were waiting.\
 \
 (paragraph 20) “What is the meaning of this?” Mayor Murphy demanded as Alex and Wendy presented each member of the council with a Woolly-Puff garland.\
 \
 (paragraph 21) Glancing at Alex for courage, Wendy said, “Woolly-Puffs are bug chasers.”\
 \
 (paragraph 22) “Sorry,” Mayor Murphy said ﬁrmly. “We have already made our decision.”\
 \
 (paragraph 23) “Just watch,” Wendy pleaded. “Watch the naggers.”\
 \
 (paragraph 24) Then someone said, “What naggers? I don’t see any.”\
 \
 (paragraph 25) “Where are the naggers?” asked Professor Raglin. “It’s as if they’re avoiding us.”\
 \
 (paragraph 26) Wendy smiled. “They are. Naggers don’t like Woolly-Puffs.”\
 \
 (paragraph 27) So the Woolly-Puffs stayed in the vases and ﬂower boxes and gardens of New Harmony because, of course, they weren’t just pretty. They smelled like moldy lemons. And luckily, naggers couldn’t stand the smell of moldy lemons.\
What does the phrase “smell funny” mean as it is used in paragraph 15?\
(A) The ﬂowers made the children laugh.\
 (B) The scent of the ﬂowers was unusual.\
 (C) The ﬂowers caused the children to be itchy.\
 (D) The stems of the ﬂowers were strange.\

In this excerpt, the author talks about introducing her chickens to her yard.\
 \
 Excerpt from Birdology\
 by Sy Montgomery\
 \
 At first I was afraid they’d run away or become lost. We had a cozy, secure home for\
 them prepared in the bottom storey of our barn, with wood shavings scattered over the\
 dirt floor, a dispenser for fresh water, a trough for chick feed, some low perches made\
 from dowels, and a hay-lined nest box made from an old rabbit hutch left over from one\
 (line 5) of the barn’s previous denizens, in which they could lay future eggs. Chickens need to be\
 closed in safe at night to protect them from predators, but by day we didn’t want to\
 confine them; we wanted to give them free run of the yard. But how could they possibly\
 understand that they lived here now? Once we let them out, would they even recognize\
 their space in the barn and go back in it? When I was in seventh grade, my family had\
 (line 10) moved, once again, to a new house; my first afternoon there I literally got lost in my own\
 backyard. Could these six-week-old chicks be expected to know better?\
 Gretchen assured me there would be no problem. “Leave them in the pen for\
 twenty-four hours,” she told me. “Then you can let them out and they’ll stick around.\
 They’ll go back in again when it starts to get dark.”\
 (line 15) “But how do they know?” I asked.\
 “They just do,” she said. “Chickens just know these things.”\
 When before dusk, I found them all perched calmly back in their coop, I saw that\
 Gretchen was right.\
 In fact, chickens know many things, some from the moment they are born. Like all\
 (line 20) members of the order in which they are classified, the Galliformes, or game birds,\
 just-hatched baby chickens are astonishingly mature and mobile, able to walk, peck, and\
 run only hours after leaving the egg.\
 This developmental strategy is called precocial. Like its opposite, the altricial strategy\
 (employed by creatures such as humans and songbirds, who are born naked and helpless),\
 (line 25) the precocial strategy was sculpted by eons of adaptation to food and predators. If your\
 nest is on the ground, as most game birds’ are, it’s a good idea to get your babies out of\
 there as quickly as possible before someone comes to eat them. So newborn game birds\
 hatch covered in down, eyes open, and leave the nest within twenty-four hours. (An\
 Australian game bird known as the malleefowl begins its life by digging its way out of\
 (line 30) its nest of decaying vegetation and walks off into the bush without ever even meeting\
 either parent.)\
 That chickens hatch from the egg knowing how to walk, run, peck, and scratch has an\
 odd consequence: many people take this as further evidence they are stupid. But instinct is\
 not stupidity. (After all, Einstein was born knowing how to suckle.) Nor does instinct\
 (line 35) preclude learning. Unlike my disoriented seventh-grade self (and I have not improved\
 much since), young chickens have a great capacity for spatial learning. In scientific\
 experiments, researchers have trained days-old chicks to find hidden food using both\
 distant and nearby landmarks as cues. Italian researchers demonstrated that at the tender\
 age of fifteen days, after just a week’s training to find hidden food in the middle of their\
 (line 40) cage, chicks can correctly calculate the center of a given environment—even in the\
 absence of distinctive landmarks. Even more astonishing, they can do it in spaces they\
 have never seen before, whether the area be circular, square, or triangular. How? The\
 chicks “probably relied on a visual estimate of these distances from their actual positions,”\
 wrote University of Padova researcher L. Tommasi and co-authors in the Journal of\
 (line 45) Comparative Physiology, ”. . . [but] it remains to be determined how the chicks actually\
 measure distances in the task.”\
 We never determined how our first chickens knew their new home was theirs, either.\
 We never knew how they managed to discern the boundaries of our property. But they\
 did. At first, they liked to stay near the coop. But as they grew, they took to following me\
 (line 50) everywhere, first cheeping like the tinkling of little bells, later clucking in animated adult\
 discussion. If I was hanging out the laundry, they would check what was in the laundry\
 basket. If I was weeding a flower bed, they would join me, raking the soil with their\
 strong, scaly feet, then stepping backward to see what was revealed. (Whenever I worked\
 with soil, I suspect they assumed I was digging for worms.) When my husband, Howard,\
 (line 55) and I would eat at the picnic table under the big silver maple, the Ladies would\
 accompany us. When my father-in-law came to help my husband build a pen for\
 Christopher Hogwood, then still a piglet, the Ladies milled underfoot to supervise every\
 move. The hens were clearly interested in the project, pecking at the shiny nails, standing\
 tall to better observe the use of tools, clucking a running commentary all the while. Before\
 (line 60) this experience, Howard’s dad would have been the first to say that he didn’t think\
 chickens were that smart. But they changed his mind. After a few hours I noticed he\
 began to address them. Picking up a hammer they were examining, he might say, directly\
 and respectfully, “Pardon me, Ladies”—as if he were speaking to my mother-in-law and\
 me when we got in the way.\
 (line 65) But when their human friends are inside, and this is much of the time, the Ladies\
 explore on their own. A chicken can move as fast as nine miles an hour, which can take\
 you pretty far, and ours are free to go anywhere they like. But ours have intuited our\
 property lines and confine their travels to its boundaries. They have never crossed the\
 street. And for years, they never hopped across the low stone wall separating our land\
 (line 70) from that of our closest neighbor. That came later—and it was not the result of any\
 physical change in the landscape, but the outcome of a change in social relationships\
 among their human friends.\

 A Dream of Mountaineering\
 The following poem was written by a revered 8th century Chinese poet (701–762 AD)\
 \
 At night, in my dream, I stoutly climbed a mountain, \
 Going out alone with my staff of holly-wood. (staff of holly-wood - a walking stick)\
 A thousand crags, a hundred hundred valleys— \
 In my dream-journey none were unexplored \
 (line 5) And all the while my feet never grew tired \
 And my step was as strong as in my young days. \
 Can it be that when the mind travels backward \
 The body also returns to its old state? \
 And can it be, as between body and soul,\
 (line 10) That the body may languish, while the soul is still strong? \
 Soul and body—both are vanities: (vanities -superficial things)\
 Dreaming and waking—both alike unreal. \
 In the day my feet are palsied (palsied - shaking) and tottering; \
 In the night my steps go striding over the hills.\
 (line 15) As day and night are divided in equal parts— \
 Between the two, I get as much as I lose. \
 \

In this excerpt, the author talks about introducing her chickens to her yard.\
 \
 Excerpt from Birdology\
 by Sy Montgomery\
 \
 At first I was afraid they’d run away or become lost. We had a cozy, secure home for\
 them prepared in the bottom storey of our barn, with wood shavings scattered over the\
 dirt floor, a dispenser for fresh water, a trough for chick feed, some low perches made\
 from dowels, and a hay-lined nest box made from an old rabbit hutch left over from one\
 (line 5) of the barn’s previous denizens, in which they could lay future eggs. Chickens need to be\
 closed in safe at night to protect them from predators, but by day we didn’t want to\
 confine them; we wanted to give them free run of the yard. But how could they possibly\
 understand that they lived here now? Once we let them out, would they even recognize\
 their space in the barn and go back in it? When I was in seventh grade, my family had\
 (line 10) moved, once again, to a new house; my first afternoon there I literally got lost in my own\
 backyard. Could these six-week-old chicks be expected to know better?\
 Gretchen assured me there would be no problem. “Leave them in the pen for\
 twenty-four hours,” she told me. “Then you can let them out and they’ll stick around.\
 They’ll go back in again when it starts to get dark.”\
 (line 15) “But how do they know?” I asked.\
 “They just do,” she said. “Chickens just know these things.”\
 When before dusk, I found them all perched calmly back in their coop, I saw that\
 Gretchen was right.\
 In fact, chickens know many things, some from the moment they are born. Like all\
 (line 20) members of the order in which they are classified, the Galliformes, or game birds,\
 just-hatched baby chickens are astonishingly mature and mobile, able to walk, peck, and\
 run only hours after leaving the egg.\
 This developmental strategy is called precocial. Like its opposite, the altricial strategy\
 (employed by creatures such as humans and songbirds, who are born naked and helpless),\
 (line 25) the precocial strategy was sculpted by eons of adaptation to food and predators. If your\
 nest is on the ground, as most game birds’ are, it’s a good idea to get your babies out of\
 there as quickly as possible before someone comes to eat them. So newborn game birds\
 hatch covered in down, eyes open, and leave the nest within twenty-four hours. (An\
 Australian game bird known as the malleefowl begins its life by digging its way out of\
 (line 30) its nest of decaying vegetation and walks off into the bush without ever even meeting\
 either parent.)\
 That chickens hatch from the egg knowing how to walk, run, peck, and scratch has an\
 odd consequence: many people take this as further evidence they are stupid. But instinct is\
 not stupidity. (After all, Einstein was born knowing how to suckle.) Nor does instinct\
 (line 35) preclude learning. Unlike my disoriented seventh-grade self (and I have not improved\
 much since), young chickens have a great capacity for spatial learning. In scientific\
 experiments, researchers have trained days-old chicks to find hidden food using both\
 distant and nearby landmarks as cues. Italian researchers demonstrated that at the tender\
 age of fifteen days, after just a week’s training to find hidden food in the middle of their\
 (line 40) cage, chicks can correctly calculate the center of a given environment—even in the\
 absence of distinctive landmarks. Even more astonishing, they can do it in spaces they\
 have never seen before, whether the area be circular, square, or triangular. How? The\
 chicks “probably relied on a visual estimate of these distances from their actual positions,”\
 wrote University of Padova researcher L. Tommasi and co-authors in the Journal of\
 (line 45) Comparative Physiology, ”. . . [but] it remains to be determined how the chicks actually\
 measure distances in the task.”\
 We never determined how our first chickens knew their new home was theirs, either.\
 We never knew how they managed to discern the boundaries of our property. But they\
 did. At first, they liked to stay near the coop. But as they grew, they took to following me\
 (line 50) everywhere, first cheeping like the tinkling of little bells, later clucking in animated adult\
 discussion. If I was hanging out the laundry, they would check what was in the laundry\
 basket. If I was weeding a flower bed, they would join me, raking the soil with their\
 strong, scaly feet, then stepping backward to see what was revealed. (Whenever I worked\
 with soil, I suspect they assumed I was digging for worms.) When my husband, Howard,\
 (line 55) and I would eat at the picnic table under the big silver maple, the Ladies would\
 accompany us. When my father-in-law came to help my husband build a pen for\
 Christopher Hogwood, then still a piglet, the Ladies milled underfoot to supervise every\
 move. The hens were clearly interested in the project, pecking at the shiny nails, standing\
 tall to better observe the use of tools, clucking a running commentary all the while. Before\
 (line 60) this experience, Howard’s dad would have been the first to say that he didn’t think\
 chickens were that smart. But they changed his mind. After a few hours I noticed he\
 began to address them. Picking up a hammer they were examining, he might say, directly\
 and respectfully, “Pardon me, Ladies”—as if he were speaking to my mother-in-law and\
 me when we got in the way.\
 (line 65) But when their human friends are inside, and this is much of the time, the Ladies\
 explore on their own. A chicken can move as fast as nine miles an hour, which can take\
 you pretty far, and ours are free to go anywhere they like. But ours have intuited our\
 property lines and confine their travels to its boundaries. They have never crossed the\
 street. And for years, they never hopped across the low stone wall separating our land\
 (line 70) from that of our closest neighbor. That came later—and it was not the result of any\
 physical change in the landscape, but the outcome of a change in social relationships\
 among their human friends.\
What do lines 23 through 31 indicate about the developmental strategy of chickens?\
(A) Chickens are adapted to food availability and pressure from predators.\
 (B) Chickens are born ready and require no further maturing.\
 (C) Chickens have a faster growth rate than other birds.\
 (D) Baby chickens spend no time with their parents.\

 (line 10) is only our experience, not its.\
 For it it’s no different than falling on anything else\
 with no assurance that it’s finished falling\
 or that it’s falling still.\
 \
 The window has a wonderful view of a lake\
 (line 15) but the view doesn’t view itself.\
 It exists in this world\
 colorless, shapeless,\
 soundless, odorless, and painless.\
 \
 The lake’s floor exists floorlessly\
 (line 20) and its shore exists shorelessly.\
 Its water feels itself neither wet nor dry\
 and its waves to themselves are neither singular nor plural.\
 They splash deaf to their own noise\
 on pebbles neither large nor small.\
 \
 (line 25) And all this beneath a sky by nature skyless\
 in which the sun sets without setting at all\
 and hides without hiding behind an unminding cloud.\
 The wind ruffles it, its only reason being\
 that it blows.\
 \
 (line 30) A second passes.\
 A second second.\
 A third.\
 But they’re three seconds only for us.\
 \
 Time has passed like a courier with urgent news.\
 (line 35) But that’s just our simile.\
 The character’s invented, his haste is make-believe,\
 his news inhuman.\

 Reading Comprehension Passage A\
 \
 The Count and the Wedding Guest\
 \
    Miss Maggie Conway and Mr. Andy Donovan are staying at the same boarding house in New York City.\
 \
    …Just coming out the door was Miss Conway. She wore a night-black dress of\
 crêpe de—crêpe de—oh, this thin black goods.(goods - fabric) Her hat was black, and from it drooped and\
 fluttered an ebon veil, filmy as a spider’s web. She stood on the top step and drew on black\
 silk gloves. Not a speck of white or a spot of color about her dress anywhere. Her rich\
 (line 5) golden hair was drawn, with scarcely a ripple, into a shining, smooth knot low on her neck.\
 Her face was plain rather than pretty, but it was now illuminated and made almost beautiful\
 by her large gray eyes that gazed above the houses across the street into the sky with an\
 expression of the most appealing sadness and melancholy. …\
    “It’s a fine, clear evening, Miss Conway,” he [Andy Donovan] said; and if the Weather\
 (line 10) Bureau could have heard the confident emphasis of his tones it would have hoisted the\
 square white signal, (square white signal - a sign of good weather) and nailed it to the mast.\
    “To them that has the heart to enjoy it, it is, Mr. Donovan,” said Miss Conway, with\
 a sigh. …\
    “I hope none of your relatives—I hope you haven’t sustained a loss?” ventured\
 (line 15) Mr. Donovan.\
    “Death has claimed,” said Miss Conway, hesitating—“not a relative, but one who—but\
 I will not intrude my grief upon you, Mr. Donovan.”\
    “Intrude?” protested Mr. Donovan. “Why, say, Miss Conway, I’d be delighted, that is,\
 I’d be sorry—I mean I’m sure nobody could sympathize with you truer than I would.”\
 (line 20)   Miss Conway smiled a little smile. And oh, it was sadder than her expression in repose. (repose - at rest) …\
    “It’s tough to be alone in New York—that’s a cinch,” said Mr. Donovan. “But, say—\
 whenever this little old town does loosen up and get friendly it goes the limit. Say you took\
 a little stroll in the park, Miss Conway—don’t you think it might chase away some of your\
 mullygrubs? And if you’d allow me—”\
 (line 25)   “Thanks, Mr. Donovan. I’d be pleased to accept of your escort if you think the company\
 of one whose heart is filled with gloom could be anyways agreeable to you.”\
    Through the open gates of the iron-railed, old, downtown park, where the elect once\
 took the air, they strolled, and found a quiet bench. …\
    “He was my fiancé,” confided Miss Conway, at the end of an hour. “We were going to\
 (line 30) be married next spring. I don’t want you to think that I am stringing you, Mr. Donovan, but\
 he was a real Count. He had an estate and a castle in Italy. Count Fernando Mazzini was\
 his name. I never saw the beat of him for elegance. Papa objected, of course, and once \
 we eloped, but papa overtook us, and took us back. I thought sure papa and Fernando \
 would fight a duel. Papa has a livery business—in P’kipsee [Poughkeepsie], you know.” … \
 (line 35)    “Three days ago I got a letter from Italy, forwarded from P’kipsee, saying that Fernando \
 had been killed in a gondola accident.” … \
    “I’ve got his picture here in my locket,” said Miss Conway, after wiping her eyes with \
 her handkerchief. “I never showed it to anybody; but I will to you, Mr. Donovan, because \
 I believe you to be a true friend.” \
 (line 40)   Mr. Donovan gazed long and with much interest at the photograph in the locket that \
 Miss Conway opened for him. The face of Count Mazzini was one to command interest. \
 It was a smooth, intelligent, bright, almost a handsome face—the face of a strong, cheerful \
 man who might well be a leader among his fellows. \
    “I have a larger one, framed, in my room,” said Miss Conway. “When we return I will\
 (line 45) show you that. They are all I have to remind me of Fernando. But he ever will be present \
 in my heart, that’s a sure thing.” \
    A subtle task confronted Mr. Donovan,—that of supplanting (supplanting - replacing) the unfortunate Count in \
 the heart of Miss Conway. This his admiration for her determined him to do. But the \
 magnitude of the undertaking did not seem to weigh upon his spirits. The sympathetic but\
 (line 50) cheerful friend was the role he essayed; (essayed - attempted) and he played it so successfully that the next \
 half-hour found them conversing pensively across two plates of ice-cream, though yet there \
 was no diminution of the sadness in Miss Conway’s large gray eyes. \
    Before they parted in the hall that evening she ran upstairs and brought down the \
 framed photograph wrapped lovingly in a white silk scarf. Mr. Donovan surveyed it with\
 (line 55) inscrutable (inscrutable - unreadable) eyes. … \
    “A fine-looking man,” said Mr. Donovan, heartily. “How would it suit you, Miss Conway, \
 to give me the pleasure of your company to Coney [Island] next Sunday afternoon?” \
    A month later they announced their engagement to Mrs. Scott and the other boarders. \
 Miss Conway continued to wear black.\
 (line 60)   A week after the announcement the two sat on the same bench in the downtown park, \
 while the fluttering leaves of the trees made a dim kinetoscopic (kinetoscopic - flickering) picture of them in the \
 moonlight. But Donovan had worn a look of abstracted gloom all day. He was so silent \
 to-night that love’s lips could not keep back any longer the questions that love’s heart \
 propounded. (propounded - put forward)\
 (line 65)   “What’s the matter, Andy, you are so solemn and grouchy to-night?”\
    “Nothing, Maggie.”\
    “I know better. Can’t I tell? You never acted this way before. What is it?” … \
    “I’ll tell you then,” said Andy, wisely, “but I guess you won’t understand it exactly. \
 You’ve heard of Mike Sullivan, haven’t you? ‘Big Mike’ Sullivan, everybody calls him.”\
 (line 70)   “No, I haven’t,” said Maggie. “And I don’t want to, if he makes you act like this. Who is \
 he?” …\
    “Well, Big Mike’s a friend of mine. I ain’t more than deuce-high in the district as far as \
 influence goes, but Mike’s as good a friend to a little man, or a poor man as he is to a big \
 one. I met him to-day on the Bowery [Street], and what do you think he does? Comes up\
 (line 75) and shakes hands. ‘Andy,’ says he, ‘I’ve been keeping cases on you. You’ve been putting in \
 some good licks over on your side of the street, and I’m proud of you. What’ll you take to \
 drink?’ He takes a cigar, and I take a highball. I told him I was going to get married in two \
 weeks. ‘Andy,’ says he, ‘send me an invitation, so I’ll keep in mind of it, and I’ll come to the \
 wedding.’ That’s what Big Mike says to me; and he always does what he says. \
 (line 80)   “You don’t understand it, Maggie, but I’d have one of my hands cut off to have Big Mike \
 Sullivan at our wedding. It would be the proudest day of my life. When he goes to a man’s \
 wedding, there’s a guy being married that’s made for life. Now, that’s why I’m maybe looking \
 sore to-night.”\
    “Why don’t you invite him, then, if he’s so much to the mustard?” (to the mustard - successful) said Maggie, lightly. …\
 (line 85)   “Maggie,” said Andy, presently, “do you think as much of me as you did of your—as you \
 did of the Count Mazzini?”\
    He waited a long time, but Maggie did not reply. And then, suddenly she leaned against \
 his shoulder and began to cry—to cry and shake with sobs, holding his arm tightly, and \
 wetting the crêpe de Chine with tears. …\
 (line 90)   But instead of being pushed away, she found Andy’s arm folding her closer. She looked \
 up and saw his face cleared and smiling. …\
    “Andy,” said Maggie, with a somewhat shy smile, after she had been thoroughly assured \
 of forgiveness, “did you believe all that story about the Count?” \
    “Well, not to any large extent,” said Andy, reaching for his cigar case, “because it’s\
 (line 95) Big Mike Sullivan’s picture you’ve got in that locket of yours.” \

Talking with Artists:\
 David Wiesner\
 compiled and edited by Pat Cummings\
 MY STORY\
 (paragraph 1) I think that I always knew I wanted to become an artist. I can't remember a time when I wasn't drawing and painting pictures. My oldest sister and my brother were artistic, and watching them draw fascinated me. They had many different art supplies around the house. There was, and still is, something very appealing about art materials: Boxes of pastels, with incredibly colored, thin, square sticks, fitting snugly into the slots in their trays. Little ink bottles with rubber stoppers and pens with interchangeable metal tips. The look, smell, and feel of rich black ink going onto bright white paper in broad, flat strokes or thin, sharp lines. I found this captivating.\
 (paragraph 2) In our town, the housepaint and wallpaper store also sold art supplies. I loved looking at all the exotic things they had for sale. Sandpaper blocks to sharpen pencils. Rows of numbered pencils, and erasers that could be pulled ike taffy. Thin drawers full of tubes of paint that seemed so much more grown up than the kind we used at school. Complicated easels and wooden boxes to hold everything.\
 (paragraph 3) My parents and friends soon saw that I had more than a passing interest in art. It came to define much of my image. Relatives gave me art-related birthday gifts. At school I became \"the kid who could draw\", a unique distinction, like \"brainiest\" or \"best athlete\"-but somehow different. A little weird, actually. I like that.\
 (paragraph 4) In my kindergarten class, we had an \"art corner\". There was an easel with a large pad of paper and poster paints. One day I was painting a picture of a red house. I can vividly recall my intense frustration because this picture just didn't look like I wanted it to.\
 (paragraph 5) As I got a little older, I began copying pictures: cartoons, comic books, and magazine illustrations. But mostly dinosaurs. I loved them. The World Book Encyclopedia published a book about the history of the earth, full of very realistic dinosaur pictures that I drew over and over again. They were in black and white and had a hazy quality to them (bad printing, I think). For a long time, even after I should have known better, I thought they were photographs of dinosaurs.\
 (paragraph 6) I found out a few years ago that these particular paintings are murals in the Chicago Field Museum. I've since seen them in person. They were painted by Charles Knight, the first and most famous painter of dinosaurs. They are still impressive, and they are in color!\
 (paragraph 7) My third-grade class wrote essays on what we wanted to be when we grew up. To me it was obvious. We read them aloud, and I told about the types of paintings I would some day try. I'd have turtles with paintbrushes tied to their backs walking around on a big sheet of paper (I got chuckles from the class and the teacher). Or I'd fill squirt guns with different colored paints and shoot at the canvas. I actually tried this with friends! Well, it sounded like a good idea.\
 (paragraph 8) One of the only discouraging childhood experiences about my artwork happened in the fourth grade. During study time I was drawing a picture. My teacher took it away and wrote an angry note home to my mother. \"David would rather be drawing pictures than doing his work!!!\" I couldn't believe it, three exclamation points. We didn't get along well for the rest of the year. School \"art classes\" were pretty uninspiring. I did my best work on textbook covers I made. Art never seemed to be taken as seriously as other subjects.\
 (paragraph 9) In the eighth grade, a big career day was held. Months before, we wrote suggestions for careers we wanted to hear about. On the big day, guest speakers from many fields came to talk. We each chose two sessions to attend, but there wasn't one that came close to an art-related field. I saw some guy talk about oceanography.\
 (paragraph 10) In high school it actually sank in that I was going to be an artist. My friends read catalogs and saw guidance counselors to pick what they'd study in college. I felt something was wrong. I already knew. I'd always known. I half expected to hear, \"No, put away those paints and choose a real career.\" My parents were excited about my choice, too. As I looked into art schools, I felt like doors were being thrown wide open. Until then my art was a private thing, but at art school I found a place where everyone was \"the kid who could draw.\"\
Why did Wiesner become interested in art?\
(A) He enjoyed watching family members draw.\
 (B) He experimented with the birthday gifts he received.\
 (C) He found fun pictures in comic books and magazines.\
 (D) He browsed the supplies at the housepaint and wallpaper store.\

 Excerpt from Snowflake Bentley\
 by Jacqueline Briggs Martin\
 \
 (paragraph 1) In the days when farmers worked with ox and sled and cut the dark with lantern light, there lived a boy who loved snow more than anything in the world. Willie Bentley’s happiest days were snowstorm days. He watched snowflakes on his mittens, on the dried grass of Vermont farm fields, on the dark metal handle of the barn door. He said snow was as beautiful as butterflies, or apple blossoms.\
 \
 (paragraph 2) He could net butterflies and show them to his older brother, Charlie. He could pick apple blossoms and take them to his mother. But he could not share snowflakes because he could not save them.\
 \
 (paragraph 3) When his mother gave him an old microscope, he used it to look at flowers, raindrops, and blades of grass. Best of all, he used it to look at snow. While other children built forts and pelted snowballs at roosting crows, Willie was catching snowflakes. Day after stormy day he studied the icy crystals.\
 \
 (paragraph 4) Their intricate patterns were even more beautiful than he had imagined. He expected to find whole flakes that were the same, that were copies of each other. But he never did. Willie decided he must find a way to save snowflakes so others could see their wonderful designs. For three winters he tried drawing snow crystals. They always melted before he could finish.\
 \
 (paragraph 5) When he was sixteen, Willie read of a camera with its own microscope. “If I had that camera I could photograph snowflakes,” he told his mother. Willie’s mother knew that he would not be happy until he could share what he had seen.\
 \
 (paragraph6) “Fussing with snow is just foolishness,” his father said. Still, he loved his son. When Willie was seventeen his parents spent their savings and bought the camera. It was taller than a newborn calf, and cost as much as his father’s herd of ten cows. Willie was sure it was the best of all cameras.\
 \
 (paragraph 7) Even so his first pictures were failures—no better than shadows. Yet he would not quit. Mistake by mistake, snowflake by snowflake, Willie worked through every storm. Winter ended, the snow melted, and he had no good pictures. He waited for another season of snow. One day, in the second winter, he tried a new experiment. And it\
 worked! Willie had figured out how to photograph snowflakes! “Now everyone can see the great beauty in a tiny crystal,” he said.\
 \
 (paragraph 8) But in those days, no one cared. Neighbors laughed at the idea of photographing snow. “Snow in Vermont is as common as dirt,” they said. “We don’t need pictures.” Willie said the photographs would be his gift to the world. While other farmers sat by the fire or rode to town with horse and sleigh, Willie studied snowstorms. He stood at the shed door and held out a black tray to catch the flakes.\
 \
 (paragraph 9) When he found only jumbled, broken crystals, he brushed the tray clean with a turkey feather and held it out again. He waited hours for just the right crystal and didn’t notice the cold. If the shed were warm the snow would melt. If he breathed on the black tray the snow would melt. If he twitched a muscle as he held the snow crystal on the long wood pick the snowflake would break. He had to work fast or the snowflake would evaporate before he could slide it into place and take its picture. Some winters he was able to make only a few dozen good pictures. Some winters he made hundreds. . . .\
 \
 (paragraph 10) But his snow crystal pictures were always his favorites. He gave copies away or sold them for a few cents. He made special pictures as gifts for birthdays. He held evening slide shows on the lawns of his friends. Children and adults sat on the grass and watched while Willie projected his slides onto a sheet hung over a clothesline.\
 \
 (paragraph 11) He wrote about snow and published his pictures in magazines. He gave speeches about snow to faraway scholars and neighborhood skywatchers. “You are doing great work,” said a professor from Wisconsin. The little farmer came to be known as the world’s expert on snow, “the Snowflake Man.” But he never grew rich. He spent every\
 penny on his pictures. Willie said there were treasures in snow. “I can’t afford to miss a single snowstorm,” he told a friend. “I never know when I will find some wonderful prize.”\
Which statement is true based on the information in paragraphs 6 and 11?\
(A) Bentley’s work with snow required expensive equipment that he was willing to spend all his money on.\
 (B) Bentley was thought to be foolish throughout his life because of his interest in snow.\
 (C) Bentley’s parents thought he should do something with his life other than\
 taking pictures of snow.\
 (D) Bentley became less interested in studying snow than in publishing pictures and giving speeches.\

Neighbors laughed at the idea of photographing snow. “Snow in Vermont is as common as dirt,” they said. “We don’t need pictures.” Willie said the photographs would be his gift to the world. While other farmers sat by the fire or rode to town with horse and sleigh, Willie studied snowstorms. He stood at the shed door and held out a black tray to catch the flakes.\
 \
 (paragraph 9) When he found only jumbled, broken crystals, he brushed the tray clean with a turkey feather and held it out again. He waited hours for just the right crystal and didn’t notice the cold. If the shed were warm the snow would melt. If he breathed on the black tray the snow would melt. If he twitched a muscle as he held the snow crystal on the long wood pick the snowflake would break. He had to work fast or the snowflake would evaporate before he could slide it into place and take its picture. Some winters he was able to make only a few dozen good pictures. Some winters he made hundreds. . . .\
 \
 (paragraph 10) But his snow crystal pictures were always his favorites. He gave copies away or sold them for a few cents. He made special pictures as gifts for birthdays. He held evening slide shows on the lawns of his friends. Children and adults sat on the grass and watched while Willie projected his slides onto a sheet hung over a clothesline.\
 \
 (paragraph 11) He wrote about snow and published his pictures in magazines. He gave speeches about snow to faraway scholars and neighborhood skywatchers. “You are doing great work,” said a professor from Wisconsin. The little farmer came to be known as the world’s expert on snow, “the Snowflake Man.” But he never grew rich. He spent every\
 penny on his pictures. Willie said there were treasures in snow. “I can’t afford to miss a single snowstorm,” he told a friend. “I never know when I will find some wonderful prize.”\

 Pond A | 10 | 20\
 Pond B | 11 | 5\
 \
 Based on the information in the chart, how does the biodiversity present in pond A compare to the biodiversity present in pond B?\
(1) Pond A has greater biodiversity than pond B because there are more species present.\
 (2) Pond B has more biodiversity than pond A because there are more plants present.\
 (3) Both ponds have the same levels of biodiversity because there is a variety of species present.\
 (4) The biodiversity cannot be determined without also identifying the abiotic factors present.\

Colombia is a country in South America that grows and exports a large portion of the coffee that is used by Americans. A group of scientists in Colombia conducted an experiment on the effects of coffee on the development of Alzheimer’s disease in elderly people. Their conclusion was that drinking coffee every day will decrease the occurrence of Alzheimer’s disease, and they recommended that Americans drink coffee several times a day. In order to evaluate this conclusion and before they encourage Americans to drink more coffee, scientists in the United States should\
(1) conduct their own experiments to see if they arrive at the same conclusion\
 (2) go to Colombia and see how the coffee is grown\
 (3) provide coffee to people with Alzheimer’s and see if it cures their disease\
 (4) construct a data table to test the hypothesis\

 Elizabeth Robles Ortega began working in the maquilas (foreign factories) at the age of fourteen and was blacklisted from employment after participating in independent union drives on Mexico’s northern border. She later worked as an organizer for the Service, Development, and Peace organization.\
 \
 NAFTA [North American Free Trade Agreement] has led to an increase in the workforce, as foreign industry has grown. They are reforming labor laws and our constitution to favor even more foreign investment, which is unfair against our labor rights. For example, they are now trying to take away from us free organization which was guaranteed by Mexican law. Because foreign capital is investing in Mexico and is dominating, we must have guarantees. The government is just there with its hands held out; it’s always had them out but now even more shamelessly. . . . Ecological problems are increasing. A majority of women are coming down with cancer — skin and breast cancer, leukemia, and lung and heart problems. There are daily deaths of worker women. You can see and feel the contamination of the water and the air. As soon as you arrive and start breathing the air in Acuña and Piedras Negras [border cities between the states of Coahuila and Texas], you sense the heavy air, making you feel like vomiting. . . .\

 Excerpt from Waste Not, Want Not\
 by Teresa Bateman\
 \
 (paragraph 1) My mother believed in using things up. We always squeezed the toothpaste tube until it was as sharp as a razor, and we cleaned our plates, even when it was liver-andonions\
 night. . . .\
 \
 (paragraph 2) Mom’s frugality was legendary. She could make one chicken come back in a dozen meals as variously disguised leftovers. Her favorite saying was “waste not, want not.” Josh and I weren’t sure what that meant, but it probably explained why Mom was into recycling long before it became popular. It also explained why the “Affair of the Hat,” as it later became known, was so strange.\
 \
 (paragraph 3) The Hat deserved capital letters. It was about three feet across, made of green straw and covered with big plastic daisies, two red peonies, and an orange bow. I might have said it was “dog ugly,” except that wouldn’t sit well with our dog, Mutt.\
 \
 (paragraph 4) Great-aunt Marjorie had given The Hat to Mother on one of her visits to our farm. It was supposed to keep the sun off Mother’s delicate complexion while enhancing her rural beauty (whatever that meant). . . .\
 \
 (paragraph 5) When Aunt Marjorie returned to the city, Josh and I held our breath to see what would happen to The Hat. We could see that Mom’s thrifty nature and fashion sense were in pitched battle. She couldn’t justify throwing The Hat away—it was nearly new and had a lot of use left in it—but neither could she stomach wearing it. She tried pulling off the daisies and peonies, but they were stuck on tight, as were the perky orange ribbons that held The Hat in place. She’d have to find some other solution.\
 \
 (paragraph 6) One day Josh and I came down to breakfast and noticed that The Hat was missing from the hook by the door. We looked at each other, then scouted the house. It wasn’t hard to spot. Mother had installed it in the parlor as a lampshade.\
 \
 (paragraph 7) Our parakeet, Pete, chirped inquiringly from his cage as Josh and I decided to see how The Hat looked in full lampshade glory. We pulled the chain.\
 \
 (paragraph 8 ) Pete tweeted once, then dropped like a stone from his perch. We ran to his cage, and Josh suggested mouth-to-beak resuscitation. Then we glanced over at the lamp. The light shining through the peonies made them look like two big red eyes glaring at you. No wonder Pete had fainted. We plucked The Hat from the lamp and went to tell Mom. Reluctantly she hung it back up on the hook by the door. . . .\
 \
 (paragraph 9) The next morning she headed out the door, The Hat filled to the brim with turkey feed. Josh and I watched as Mother approached the turkeys scavenging in the barnyard. The minute those turkeys sighted The Hat, they ran gobbling toward the barn door and dived in a panic into the haystack. Mom dumped the turkey feed in the barnyard and\
 walked back to the house, her shoulders drooping. . . .\
 \
 (paragraph 10) She threw The Hat to the floor, raised her foot, and screamed, “THIS HAT IS FOR THE BIRDS!” Josh and I stepped back, waiting for her foot to come crashing down.\
 \
 (paragraph 11) “It is not for the birds,” Josh blurted. \"They hate it!”\
 \
 (paragraph 12) It was as though time stood still. Then we heard a strange sound. Mother was laughing!\
 \
 (paragraph 13) We shook our heads. She’d finally gone over the edge—there she stood, one foot in the air, laughing like a hysterical flamingo.\
 \
 (paragraph 14) Then she put her foot down . . . on the floor. She picked up The Hat and headed upstairs where we heard boxes being shuffled around in the attic. . .\
 \
 (paragraph 15) When she came down, she was dragging a body. It was wearing Grandpa’s old overalls, Uncle Paul’s flannel shirt, and the shoes Josh had outgrown last year. Its head was a flour sack, stuffed full of straw from an old tick, and on that head perched The Hat.\
 \
 tick = mattress\
 \
 (paragraph 16) Mom hauled the stuffed body outside and set it up on a post in the middle of the cornfield. And that’s where it stayed.\
 \
 (paragraph 17) Our corn crop that year was particularly good. For some reason the birds steered clear of our fields and raided the neighbors’ instead. Maybe it had something to do with our scarecrow, I don’t know. All I do know is that from then on, we rarely saw crows on our property except during the month of June.\
 \
 (paragraph 16) That’s when Great-aunt Marjorie comes to visit.\
How does paragraph 5 contribute to the story’s structure?\
(A) It foreshadows the resolution of the story.\
 (B) It develops the narrator’s feelings about Mother.\
 (C) It explains Mother’s problem in detail.\
 (D) It gives background details that explain the story.\

 Reading Comprehension Passage A\
 \
 Caramelo\
 \
    One would think now that she was living in Chicago, in the same city as her [favorite son] \
 Inocencio, the Grandmother would find happiness. But no, that wasn’t the case. The \
 Grandmother was meaner than ever. She was unhappy. And didn’t know she was unhappy, \
 the worst kind of unhappiness of all. As a result, everyone was in a hurry to find her a house\
 (line 5) of some sort. A bungalow, a duplex, a brownstone, an apartment. Something, anything, \
 because the Grandmother’s gloominess was the contagious kind, infecting every member of \
 the household as fiercely as the bubonic plague. \
    Because Baby [Inocencio’s brother] and Ninfa’s apartment had room to accommodate \
 a guest, it was understood the Grandmother would stay with them until she could find a \
 (line 10) house of her own. This had seemed all well and fine when the plans were made long-\
 distance with Uncle Baby shouting into the receiver that he insisted, that he and Ninfa \
 wouldn’t think of her staying anywhere else, that the girls were thrilled she was coming. But \
 now that she was actually sleeping in [granddaughter] Amor’s narrow bed with radios and \
 televisions chattering throughout the apartment, and doors and cupboards banging, and the \
 (line 15) stink of cigarettes soaking into everything, even her skin, and trucks rumbling past and \
 shaking the building like an earthquake, and sirens and car horns at all hours, well, it just \
 about drove her crazy; even the rowdy Chicago wind, a rough, moody brute who took one \
 look at you and laughed. …\
    All day and all night the expressway traffic whooshed past, keeping the Grandmother\
 (line 20) awake. She napped when she could, even when the apartment and its inhabitants jabbered \
 the loudest. She was tired all the time, and yet she had trouble sleeping, often waking once \
 or twice in the early morning, and in her sleeplessness, padding in her house slippers to the \
 living room, where the front windows looked out onto the lanes of traffic, the expressway \
 billboards, and the frighteningly grimy factories beyond. The trucks and cars, furious to get\
 (line 25) from here to there, never paused for a moment, the sound of the expressway almost not a \
 sound at all, but a roar like the voice of the sea trapped inside a shell. \
    She pressed her forehead against the cold glass and sighed. If the Grandmother had \
 consulted her feelings, she would’ve understood why it was taking her so long to buy a new \
 house and settle in Chicago, but she was not a woman given to reflection. She missed her\
 (line 30) old house too much and was too proud to admit she’d made a mistake. She couldn’t go \
 backward, could she? She was stuck, in the middle of nowhere it seemed, halfway between \
 here and where? \
    The Grandmother missed the routine of her mornings, her three-minute eggs and \
 bolillo (bolillo - crunchy roll) breakfasts. She missed rubbing her big toe along the octagon tiles of her bathroom \
 (line 35) floor. But most of all, she missed her own bed with its mattress sagging in the center, the \
 familiar scent and weight of her blankets, the way morning entered gradually from the left\
 as the sun climbed over the east courtyard wall, the one topped with a cockscomb (cockscomb -rooster’s crown with jagged edges) of glass \
 shards to keep out the thieves. Why do we get so used to waking up in a certain room? And \
 when we aren’t in our own bed and wake up in another, a terrible fear for a moment, like\
 (line 40) death.\
    There is nothing worse than being a houseguest for too long, especially when your host\
 is a relative. The Grandmother felt like a prisoner. She hated climbing up the three flights\
 of stairs, and always arrived clutching her heart, convinced she was having an attack, like\
 the one that killed Narciso [her husband]. Really, once she was upstairs, she couldn’t even\
 (line 45) bear the thought of coming back down. What a barbarity! …\
    To visit Chicago is one thing, to live there another. This was not the Chicago of her\
 vacations, where one is always escorted to the lake shore, to the gold coast, driven along the\
 winding lanes of traffic of Lake Shore Drive in the shadow of beautiful apartment buildings,\
 along State Street and Michigan Avenue to window-shop at least. And perhaps taken on an\
 (line 50) excursion on the lake. How is it she hadn’t noticed the expression of the citizens, not the\
 ones fluttering in and out of taxis, but the ones at bus stops, hopping like sparrows, shivering\
 and peering anxiously for the next bus, and those descending wearily into the filthy bowels\
 of the subway like the souls condemned to purgatory.(purgatory - place of suffering)\
    At first the Grandmother was thrilled by the restaurants and the big discount chains—\
 (line 55) but then the routine got to be too familiar. Saturdays in search of houses that were not to\
 her liking. Dark brick houses with small, squinty windows, gloomy apartments, or damp\
 little bungalows, everything somber and sad and not letting in enough light, and no\
 courtyards, a dank, (dank - damp) mean gangway, a small patch of thin grass called a garden, and maybe a\
 bald tree in front. This wasn’t what she had in mind.\
 (line 60)   And as the weeks and months passed, and she was still without a house, the rainy, cold\
 autumn weather began and only made her feel worse. There was the Chicago winter\
 coming that everyone had warned her about, and she was already so cold and miserable she\
 didn’t feel much like leaving her room, let alone the building. She blamed Ninfa, who kept\
 lowering the heat in order to save money. The Grandmother confined herself to bed,\
 (line 65) satisfied only when she was under several layers of blankets. …\
    But nothing, nothing in the Grandmother’s imagination prepared her for the horrors of\
 a Chicago winter. It was not the picturesque (picturesque - charming) season of Christmas, but the endless tundra\

 of ice behind a dirty woolen sky. It was a cold like you can’t imagine, a barbarous thing, a\

 dying, that killed one slowly, a torture. Let me die in February, let me die rather than have\
 to step out the door again, please, the Grandmother thought to herself, dreading having to\
 dress like a monster to go outside. —Ay, ya no puedo. I can’t anymore, I can’t. And just\
 when she could no longer, when she could no longer find the strength, the drive, the will to\
 (line 80) keep on living, when she was ready to fold into herself and let her spirit die, just then, and\
 only then, did April arrive with sky the color of hope and branches filled with possibilities.\

 Reading Comprehension Passage A\
 \
 Caramelo\
 \
    One would think now that she was living in Chicago, in the same city as her [favorite son] \
 Inocencio, the Grandmother would find happiness. But no, that wasn’t the case. The \
 Grandmother was meaner than ever. She was unhappy. And didn’t know she was unhappy, \
 the worst kind of unhappiness of all. As a result, everyone was in a hurry to find her a house\
 (line 5) of some sort. A bungalow, a duplex, a brownstone, an apartment. Something, anything, \
 because the Grandmother’s gloominess was the contagious kind, infecting every member of \
 the household as fiercely as the bubonic plague. \
    Because Baby [Inocencio’s brother] and Ninfa’s apartment had room to accommodate \
 a guest, it was understood the Grandmother would stay with them until she could find a \
 (line 10) house of her own. This had seemed all well and fine when the plans were made long-\
 distance with Uncle Baby shouting into the receiver that he insisted, that he and Ninfa \
 wouldn’t think of her staying anywhere else, that the girls were thrilled she was coming. But \
 now that she was actually sleeping in [granddaughter] Amor’s narrow bed with radios and \
 televisions chattering throughout the apartment, and doors and cupboards banging, and the \
 (line 15) stink of cigarettes soaking into everything, even her skin, and trucks rumbling past and \
 shaking the building like an earthquake, and sirens and car horns at all hours, well, it just \
 about drove her crazy; even the rowdy Chicago wind, a rough, moody brute who took one \
 look at you and laughed. …\
    All day and all night the expressway traffic whooshed past, keeping the Grandmother\
 (line 20) awake. She napped when she could, even when the apartment and its inhabitants jabbered \
 the loudest. She was tired all the time, and yet she had trouble sleeping, often waking once \
 or twice in the early morning, and in her sleeplessness, padding in her house slippers to the \
 living room, where the front windows looked out onto the lanes of traffic, the expressway \
 billboards, and the frighteningly grimy factories beyond. The trucks and cars, furious to get\
 (line 25) from here to there, never paused for a moment, the sound of the expressway almost not a \
 sound at all, but a roar like the voice of the sea trapped inside a shell. \
    She pressed her forehead against the cold glass and sighed. If the Grandmother had \
 consulted her feelings, she would’ve understood why it was taking her so long to buy a new \
 house and settle in Chicago, but she was not a woman given to reflection. She missed her\
 (line 30) old house too much and was too proud to admit she’d made a mistake. She couldn’t go \
 backward, could she? She was stuck, in the middle of nowhere it seemed, halfway between \
 here and where? \
    The Grandmother missed the routine of her mornings, her three-minute eggs and \
 bolillo (bolillo - crunchy roll) breakfasts. She missed rubbing her big toe along the octagon tiles of her bathroom \
 (line 35) floor. But most of all, she missed her own bed with its mattress sagging in the center, the \
 familiar scent and weight of her blankets, the way morning entered gradually from the left\
 as the sun climbed over the east courtyard wall, the one topped with a cockscomb (cockscomb -rooster’s crown with jagged edges) of glass \
 shards to keep out the thieves. Why do we get so used to waking up in a certain room? And \
 when we aren’t in our own bed and wake up in another, a terrible fear for a moment, like\
 (line 40) death.\
    There is nothing worse than being a houseguest for too long, especially when your host\
 is a relative. The Grandmother felt like a prisoner. She hated climbing up the three flights\
 of stairs, and always arrived clutching her heart, convinced she was having an attack, like\
 the one that killed Narciso [her husband]. Really, once she was upstairs, she couldn’t even\
 (line 45) bear the thought of coming back down. What a barbarity! …\
    To visit Chicago is one thing, to live there another. This was not the Chicago of her\
 vacations, where one is always escorted to the lake shore, to the gold coast, driven along the\
 winding lanes of traffic of Lake Shore Drive in the shadow of beautiful apartment buildings,\
 along State Street and Michigan Avenue to window-shop at least. And perhaps taken on an\
 (line 50) excursion on the lake. How is it she hadn’t noticed the expression of the citizens, not the\
 ones fluttering in and out of taxis, but the ones at bus stops, hopping like sparrows, shivering\
 and peering anxiously for the next bus, and those descending wearily into the filthy bowels\
 of the subway like the souls condemned to purgatory.(purgatory - place of suffering)\
    At first the Grandmother was thrilled by the restaurants and the big discount chains—\
 (line 55) but then the routine got to be too familiar. Saturdays in search of houses that were not to\
 her liking. Dark brick houses with small, squinty windows, gloomy apartments, or damp\
 little bungalows, everything somber and sad and not letting in enough light, and no\
 courtyards, a dank, (dank - damp) mean gangway, a small patch of thin grass called a garden, and maybe a\
 bald tree in front. This wasn’t what she had in mind.\
 (line 60)   And as the weeks and months passed, and she was still without a house, the rainy, cold\
 autumn weather began and only made her feel worse. There was the Chicago winter\
 coming that everyone had warned her about, and she was already so cold and miserable she\
 didn’t feel much like leaving her room, let alone the building. She blamed Ninfa, who kept\
 lowering the heat in order to save money. The Grandmother confined herself to bed,\
 (line 65) satisfied only when she was under several layers of blankets. …\
    But nothing, nothing in the Grandmother’s imagination prepared her for the horrors of\
 a Chicago winter. It was not the picturesque (picturesque - charming) season of Christmas, but the endless tundra\
 of January, February, and March. Daylight dimmed to a dull pewter. (pewter - gray) The sun a thick piece\
 of ice behind a dirty woolen sky. It was a cold like you can’t imagine, a barbarous thing, a\
 (line 70) knife in the bone, a cold so cold it burned the lungs if one could even believe such a cold.\
 And the mountains of filthy snow shoveled in huge heaps, the chunks of ice on the sidewalk\
 that could kill an aged citizen. —Oh, this is nothing, you should’ve been here for the Big\
 Snow, the grandchildren bragged, speaking of the recent storm of ’68.\
    Big snow or little snow, it was all the same after the novelty of snow had worn off. A\

 (line 80) keep on living, when she was ready to fold into herself and let her spirit die, just then, and\
 only then, did April arrive with sky the color of hope and branches filled with possibilities.\

 Reading Comprehension Passage A\
 \
 Caramelo\
 \
    One would think now that she was living in Chicago, in the same city as her [favorite son] \
 Inocencio, the Grandmother would find happiness. But no, that wasn’t the case. The \
 Grandmother was meaner than ever. She was unhappy. And didn’t know she was unhappy, \
 the worst kind of unhappiness of all. As a result, everyone was in a hurry to find her a house\
 (line 5) of some sort. A bungalow, a duplex, a brownstone, an apartment. Something, anything, \
 because the Grandmother’s gloominess was the contagious kind, infecting every member of \
 the household as fiercely as the bubonic plague. \
    Because Baby [Inocencio’s brother] and Ninfa’s apartment had room to accommodate \
 a guest, it was understood the Grandmother would stay with them until she could find a \
 (line 10) house of her own. This had seemed all well and fine when the plans were made long-\
 distance with Uncle Baby shouting into the receiver that he insisted, that he and Ninfa \
 wouldn’t think of her staying anywhere else, that the girls were thrilled she was coming. But \
 now that she was actually sleeping in [granddaughter] Amor’s narrow bed with radios and \
 televisions chattering throughout the apartment, and doors and cupboards banging, and the \
 (line 15) stink of cigarettes soaking into everything, even her skin, and trucks rumbling past and \
 shaking the building like an earthquake, and sirens and car horns at all hours, well, it just \
 about drove her crazy; even the rowdy Chicago wind, a rough, moody brute who took one \
 look at you and laughed. …\
    All day and all night the expressway traffic whooshed past, keeping the Grandmother\
 (line 20) awake. She napped when she could, even when the apartment and its inhabitants jabbered \
 the loudest. She was tired all the time, and yet she had trouble sleeping, often waking once \
 or twice in the early morning, and in her sleeplessness, padding in her house slippers to the \
 living room, where the front windows looked out onto the lanes of traffic, the expressway \
 billboards, and the frighteningly grimy factories beyond. The trucks and cars, furious to get\
 (line 25) from here to there, never paused for a moment, the sound of the expressway almost not a \
 sound at all, but a roar like the voice of the sea trapped inside a shell. \
    She pressed her forehead against the cold glass and sighed. If the Grandmother had \
 consulted her feelings, she would’ve understood why it was taking her so long to buy a new \
 house and settle in Chicago, but she was not a woman given to reflection. She missed her\
 (line 30) old house too much and was too proud to admit she’d made a mistake. She couldn’t go \
 backward, could she? She was stuck, in the middle of nowhere it seemed, halfway between \
 here and where? \
    The Grandmother missed the routine of her mornings, her three-minute eggs and \
 bolillo (bolillo - crunchy roll) breakfasts. She missed rubbing her big toe along the octagon tiles of her bathroom \
 (line 35) floor. But most of all, she missed her own bed with its mattress sagging in the center, the \
 familiar scent and weight of her blankets, the way morning entered gradually from the left\
 as the sun climbed over the east courtyard wall, the one topped with a cockscomb (cockscomb -rooster’s crown with jagged edges) of glass \
 shards to keep out the thieves. Why do we get so used to waking up in a certain room? And \
 when we aren’t in our own bed and wake up in another, a terrible fear for a moment, like\
 (line 40) death.\
    There is nothing worse than being a houseguest for too long, especially when your host\
 is a relative. The Grandmother felt like a prisoner. She hated climbing up the three flights\
 of stairs, and always arrived clutching her heart, convinced she was having an attack, like\
 the one that killed Narciso [her husband]. Really, once she was upstairs, she couldn’t even\
 (line 45) bear the thought of coming back down. What a barbarity! …\
    To visit Chicago is one thing, to live there another. This was not the Chicago of her\
 vacations, where one is always escorted to the lake shore, to the gold coast, driven along the\
 winding lanes of traffic of Lake Shore Drive in the shadow of beautiful apartment buildings,\
 along State Street and Michigan Avenue to window-shop at least. And perhaps taken on an\
 (line 50) excursion on the lake. How is it she hadn’t noticed the expression of the citizens, not the\
 ones fluttering in and out of taxis, but the ones at bus stops, hopping like sparrows, shivering\
 and peering anxiously for the next bus, and those descending wearily into the filthy bowels\
 of the subway like the souls condemned to purgatory.(purgatory - place of suffering)\
    At first the Grandmother was thrilled by the restaurants and the big discount chains—\
 (line 55) but then the routine got to be too familiar. Saturdays in search of houses that were not to\
 her liking. Dark brick houses with small, squinty windows, gloomy apartments, or damp\
 little bungalows, everything somber and sad and not letting in enough light, and no\
 courtyards, a dank, (dank - damp) mean gangway, a small patch of thin grass called a garden, and maybe a\
 bald tree in front. This wasn’t what she had in mind.\
 (line 60)   And as the weeks and months passed, and she was still without a house, the rainy, cold\
 autumn weather began and only made her feel worse. There was the Chicago winter\
 coming that everyone had warned her about, and she was already so cold and miserable she\
 didn’t feel much like leaving her room, let alone the building. She blamed Ninfa, who kept\
 lowering the heat in order to save money. The Grandmother confined herself to bed,\
 (line 65) satisfied only when she was under several layers of blankets. …\
    But nothing, nothing in the Grandmother’s imagination prepared her for the horrors of\
 a Chicago winter. It was not the picturesque (picturesque - charming) season of Christmas, but the endless tundra\
 of January, February, and March. Daylight dimmed to a dull pewter. (pewter - gray) The sun a thick piece\
 of ice behind a dirty woolen sky. It was a cold like you can’t imagine, a barbarous thing, a\
 (line 70) knife in the bone, a cold so cold it burned the lungs if one could even believe such a cold.\
 And the mountains of filthy snow shoveled in huge heaps, the chunks of ice on the sidewalk\
 that could kill an aged citizen. —Oh, this is nothing, you should’ve been here for the Big\
 Snow, the grandchildren bragged, speaking of the recent storm of ’68.\
    Big snow or little snow, it was all the same after the novelty of snow had worn off. A\
 (line 75) nuisance, a deadly thing, an exaggerated, long, drawn-out ordeal that made one feel like\
 dying, that killed one slowly, a torture. Let me die in February, let me die rather than have\
 to step out the door again, please, the Grandmother thought to herself, dreading having to\
 dress like a monster to go outside. —Ay, ya no puedo. I can’t anymore, I can’t. And just\
 when she could no longer, when she could no longer find the strength, the drive, the will to\
 (line 80) keep on living, when she was ready to fold into herself and let her spirit die, just then, and\
 only then, did April arrive with sky the color of hope and branches filled with possibilities.\

Two Days With No Phone\
 by Sarah Jane Brian\
 Experts worry that teen texting is out of control. Could you give up your phone for 48 hours? Our brave volunteers did.\
 (paragraph 1) Instead of sleeping, Kenny Alarcon, 16, often texts with his friends through the night. \"You get an urge'\" explains the teen, who lives in the Bronx in New York City. \"When I get a text, I'm itching to respond to it even if I want to sleep.\"\
 (paragraph 2) Franchesca Garcia, a high school senior from Providence, Rhode Island, has also felt the need to stay constantly connected. We asked how many texts she sent and received each day. \"I don't know . . . maybe 1,000?\" she answered. \"It's too many to count.\"\
 (paragraph 3) It probably won't surprise you that teens are texting more than ever before. Some experts are worried about how all that texting is affecting teenagers' lives.\
 \
 Teens in Trouble?\
 \
 (paragraph 4) One concern is that students might not learn correct grammar and spelling if most of the writing they do is made up of text messages. Some people also worry that because teens text so much, they don't spend enough time talking with others face-to-face. That could be hurting their relationships with friends and family.\
 (paragraph 5) Plus, all that texting (and time on social media) takes away from hours that could be spent studying, exercising, pursuing a hobby, or just relaxing.\
 (paragraph 6) Dr. Elizabeth Dowdell is a professor at Villanova University in Pennsylvania. She says that many people expect to be able to access anyone or to be accessed by anyone at any time. \"It's very appealing, especially to a middle or high school student,\" she explains. \"The problem is, there's no downtime.\" And people need downtime-especially when it comes to sleep.\
 \
 Sleep Texting\
 \
 (paragraph 7) Both Franchesca and Kenny told us that they wake up several times during the night to text. Kenny even sleeps with his phone beneath his pillow.\
 (paragraph 8) Dr. Dowdell says that it's common for teens' sleep to be interrupted by texts. Sometimes teens even send texts filled with nonsense words when they don't wake up all the way. She has been studying this trend, which she calls \"sleep texting.\"\
 (paragraph 9) Why is sleep texting a problem? \"Adolescents need a solid 8, 10, even 1 1 hours of sleep to really function and to think clearly\", reports Dr. Dowdell. If they regularly lose sleep, she adds, teens may start having trouble in school. They may become grumpy, angry, or depressed. A lack of sleep can lead to weight gain and even obesity. That's because many people turn to junk food for quick energy when they are tired.\
 \
 The 48-Hour Challenge\
 \
 (paragraph 10) According to Dr. Dowdell, teens need to learn that they can-and should-turn off their phones sometimes. So we decided to have Kenny and Franchesca do an experiment.\
 (paragraph 11) These were the rules: No phone for 48 hours. No computer or Internet either, unless it was for schoolwork. No Twitter, no Instagram.\
 (paragraph 12) Would these two teenagers be able to do it?\
 (paragraph 13) \"I think I'm going to feel really isolated\", Kenny worried. Franchesca was nervous but brave. \"I'm excited for the challenge\", she said. \"I don't know what's going to happen.\"\
 (paragraph 14) Kenny and Franchesca handed their phones to their mothers for safekeeping. The\
 challenge was on.\
 \
 The Results\
 \
 (paragraph 15) We caught up with Kenny and Franchesca after 48 phone-free hours. \"Wow, it was pure torture\", Kenny joked. But though life with no phone wasn't easy, he admitted \"it had benefits.\"\
 (paragraph 16) Sure, Kenny missed his friends, and he was sad at times. But he also felt relief from the constant texting. \"Sometimes it's teenager drama, people gossiping\" he explained. \"I felt less stressed because I didn't have to be involved.\"\
 (paragraph 17) Instead of texting, Kenny went to the gym and caught up on schoolwork. The first night, he told us, \"I slept for 18 hours!\" He also spent time sitting with his family and talking. Kenny's mom helped him with homework for the first time in two years. Said Kenny, \"I felt closer to my parents.\"\
 (paragraph 18) Franchesca had an even happier result when she put away her phone. \"I loved it!\" she said. \"I was going to the gym and hanging out with friends and playing basketball. I had a wonderful experience.\" She slept better too.\
 (paragraph 19) Franchesca decided to continue the experiment for a while. \"I think I'll be so much smarter and healthier,' she explained. \"Everybody in the world should try it.\"\
 (paragraph 20) Kenny doesn't plan to give up his phone again. But he now knows that he can live without it. Said the teen, \"It was a reality check.\"\
Which evidence best supports the claims the author makes in paragraph 4?\
(A) \"They may become grumpy, angry, or depressed.\" (paragraph 9)\
 (B) \"Sure, Kenny missed his friends, and he was sad at times.\" (paragraph 16)\
 (C) \"Kenny's mom helped him with homework for the first time in two years.\" (paragraph 17)\
 (D) \"I had a wonderful experience.\" (paragraph 18)\

Alan is on a volcano on Titan, a moon of Saturn. As the story opens, Alan is stranded on its summit in his space crawler. Luckily, he has brought along his mechanical wings.\
 \
 Excerpt from Fly for Your Life\
 \
 by John Frizell\
 \
 (paragraph 1) Alan knew there was no way back to the base and no way the crew there could help him remotely—the other crawler was down for maintenance. He could go down this side of the stream for 23 kilometers, to a flat area where the flowing liquid would spread out and be shallow enough to cross; then go back 23 kilometers to the far side of the bridge. One problem: he would definitely run out of air before he got there.\
 \
 (paragraph 2) Then Alan thought of the folded flight wings he had attached to his suit. Could he fly across the river and then walk to the base? Some quick calculations showed it wouldn’t work. He had enough air, but the battery that powered the heater of the suit he wore to stay alive on Titan was only good for an hour, not the four-hour walk it would take to reach the base. Spacewalks were usually done trailing a power cable plugged in to the suit. The cable carried power from the crawler to supplement the suit’s battery. Without the supplemental power, he would freeze solid in 10 minutes once the battery was exhausted.\
 \
 (paragraph 3) Alan knew flying the whole way was impossible. Even with Titan’s thick atmosphere and low gravity the suit made flying hard work, worse than running uphill carrying a sack of cement. No one could stay aloft for more than 10 minutes. It would be at least a half-hour flight to the base.\
 \
 (paragraph 4) He needed more than wings alone to get back alive. Then it came to him. Bolted to the side of the crawler was a squat, black cylinder containing compressed nitrogen at 200 bar, compressed Titanian atmosphere in fact, used for cleaning gunk off the crawler’s treads. Alan struggled with the bolts, working carefully in the searing cold with tools as brittle as glass. When he had the cylinder off, propped up, and pointing at the sky, he put his wings on, and then took them off, repeating the task until he could do it without thinking about it. . . .\
 \
 (paragraph 5) He pulled the power cable out of his suit’s hip socket and, before he could change his mind, gave a sharp tug on a line that he had attached to the valve of the pressure cylinder. The cylinder hissed like a giant snake, as high-pressure nitrogen blasted out, and then shot into the sky. A length of climbing rope he had attached to it went taut and snatched him into the air, where he was buffeted and tossed by the jet of nitrogen pouring down on him. It was like being caught under a breaking wave, pounded again and again by the surf. He was directly under the cylinder, using his weight and drag to keep the nozzle pointed down as the cylinder lofted him into Titan’s sky. The ground beneath, blurred by the motion, made it impossible to gauge height or direction.\
 \
 (paragraph 6) Time slowed; his shuddering world narrowed to the readout of the Titan Positioning System (TPS)—the icy moon’s equivalent of GPS. Gradually, the pounding lessened as the rate of climb shown on the readout passed its peak and began falling. Alan waited. Just before it hit zero, he cut the rope. The cylinder, relieved of his drag, flew off, dwindling to a black dot and then disappearing into the empty sky above. Now he was coasting upward, propelled by the momentum imparted to him by the nitrogen rocket. He was high in the air, but already he was slowing under the drag of the thick atmosphere. He had to get the wings on before the downward fall began. Once he started to move with some speed, he would begin to spin and never get them on. The first wing stuck and he had to take his arm out of the loops and try again. . . .\
 \
 (paragraph 7) He was gathering speed on his way down before he got the second one on. He spread his wings and rolled into a comfortable position, soaring over the moon’s dimly lit surface. The TPS showed that he was heading away from the base. He banked in an easy curve and settled on a course for home. All he had to do was hold the wings rigid and enjoy the ride. He took an occasional flap, just for fun. . . .\
 \
 (paragraph 8) As Alan glided toward the base, he flapped more often, watching the height-abovesurface and distance-to-target displays. As they unwound, an unpleasant feeling, like a trace of the frigid atmosphere outside, crept into his stomach. His elevation was dropping dangerously, with over three kilometers left to go on distance-to-target. He could see details on the surface more clearly now, because he was flying so low. . . .\
 \
 (paragraph 9) Alan forced himself to stay calm. Panic would mean disaster. He started flapping his wings faster, faster, faster. . . . He could feel himself lifting with every beat of the massive appendages. Faster, faster, faster. . . . His descent rate began to slow, but the muscles in his arms burned with pain. . . .\
 \
 (paragraph 10) Time stretched out endlessly.\
 \
 (paragraph 11) The TPS buzzed loudly in his helmet. Target. the station’s beacon was directly below him. He could barely feel his arms, but something made them stop flapping. He gratefully fell out of the sky, wrapped in a ball of pain, with barely the strength to flare his wings one last time for a soft landing. . . .\
 \
 (paragraph 12) Then he saw someone running toward him with a power cable in hand. Voices boomed into his helmet. It sounded like the whole station was in the control room waiting to see if he had made it.\
 \
 (paragraph 13) “Alan! ALAN! Say something! Can you move? Are you receiving this?” He recognized the voice of the base leader. . . .\
 \
 (paragraph 14) As the crew lifted him carefully onto a stretcher, he looked up at Titan’s hazy sky. I flew for my life today, he thought. I survived. That’s the only record that matters.\
In paragraph 9, “appendages” refers to something that\
(A) calms a person\
 (B) is attached\
 (C) slows things down\
 (D) is lightweight\

Reading Comprehension Passage A\
 \
 …It was so cold that his first breath turned to iron in his throat, the hairs in his nostrils\
 webbed into instant ice, his eyes stung and watered. In the faint starlight and the bluish\
 luminescence of the snow everything beyond a few yards away swam deceptive and without\
 depth, glimmering with things half seen or imagined. Beside the dead car he stood with his\
 (line 5) head bent, listening, and there was not a sound. Everything on the planet might have died\
 in the cold. …\
 \
 But here he stood in light overcoat and thin leather gloves, without overshoes, and his\
 car all but blocked the road, and the door could not be locked, and there was not a\
 possibility that he could carry the heavy cases with him to the next farm or village. He\
 (line 10) switched on the headlights again and studied the roadside they revealed, and saw a rail\
 fence, with cedars and spruces behind it. When more complex gadgets and more complex\
 cures failed, there was always the lucifer match (lucifer match — a match that ignites through friction).\
 \
 Ten minutes later he was sitting with the auto robe over his head and shoulders and his\
 back against the plowed snowbank, digging the half melted snow from inside his shoes and\
 (line 15) gloating over the growing light and warmth of the fire. He had a supply of fence rails good\
 for an hour. In that time, someone would come along and he could get a push or a tow. In\
 this country, in winter, no one ever passed up a stranded motorist. …\
 \
 Abruptly he did not want to wait in that lonely snow-banked ditch any longer. The\
 sample cases (sample cases — cases of medicine samples) could look after themselves, any motorist who passed could take his own\
 (line 20) chances. He would walk ahead to the nearest help, and if he found himself getting too cold\
 on the way, he could always build another fire. The thought of action cheered him; he\
 admitted to himself that he was all but terrified at the silence and the iron cold. …\
 \
 Turning with the road, he passed through the stretch of woods and came into the open\
 to see the moon-white, shadow-black buildings of a farm, and the weak bloom of light in a\
 (line 25) window. …\
 \
 “Hello?” he said, and knocked again. “Anybody home?” No sound answered him. He\
 saw the moon glint on the great icicles along the eaves. His numb hand ached with the pain\
 of knocking; he pounded with the soft edge of his fist.\
 \
 Answer finally came, not from the door before which he stood, but from the barn, down\
 (line 30) at the end of a staggered string of attached sheds. A door creaked open against a snowbank\
 and a figure with a lantern appeared, stood for a moment, and came running. The traveler\
 wondered at the way it came, lurching and stumbling in the uneven snow, until it arrived at\
 the porch and he saw that it was a boy of eleven or twelve. The boy set his lantern on the\
 porch; between the upturned collar of his mackinaw (mackinaw — type of warm coat) and the down-pulled stocking cap his\
 (line 35) face was a pinched whiteness, his eyes enormous. He stared at the traveler until the traveler\
 became aware of the blanket he still held over head and shoulders, and began to laugh.\
 \
 “My car stopped on me, a mile or so up the road,” he said. “I was just hunting a\
 telephone or some place where I could get help.”\
 \
 The boy swallowed, wiped the back of his mitt across his nose. “Grandpa’s sick!” he\
 (line 40) blurted, and opened the door. …\
 \
 “He must’ve had a shock,” the boy said. “I came in from chores and he was on the floor.”\
 He stared at the mummy under the quilt, and he swallowed. …\
 \
 “Why didn’t you go for help?”\
 \
 The boy looked down, ashamed. “It’s near two miles. I was afraid he’d.…”\
 \
 (line 45) “But you left him. You were out in the barn.”\
 \
 “I was hitching up to go,” the boy said. “I’d made up my mind.”\
 \
 The traveler backed away from the stove, his face smarting (smarting — stinging) with the heat, his fingers\
 and feet beginning to ache. He looked at the old man and knew that here, as at the car, he\
 was helpless. The boy’s thin anxious face told him how thoroughly his own emergency had\
 (line 50) been swallowed up in this other one. He had been altered from a man in need of help to\
 one who must give it. Salesman of wonder cures, he must now produce something to calm\
 this over-worried boy, restore a dying man. Rebelliously, victimized by circumstances, he\
 said, “Where were you going for help?”\
 \
 “The Hill place. They’ve got a phone.”\
 \
 (line 55) “How far are they from a town?”\
 \
 “About five miles.”\
 \
 “Doctor there?”\
 \
 “Yes.”\
 \
 “If I took your horse and—what is it, sleigh?—could someone at the Hills’ bring them\
 (line 60) back, do you think?”\
 \
 “Cutter (cutter — a small horse-drawn sled). One of the Hill boys could, I should say.”\
 \
 “Or would you rather go, while I look after your Grandpa?”\
 \
 “He don’t know you,” the boy said directly. “If he should wake up he might … wonder\
 … it might.…”\
 \
 (line 65) The traveler grudgingly gave up the prospect of staying in the warm kitchen while the\
 boy did the work. And he granted that it was extraordinarily sensitive of the boy to know\
 how it might disturb a man to wake from sickness in his own house and stare into the face\
 of an utter stranger. “Yes,” he said. “Well, I could call the doctor from the Hills’. Two miles,\
 did you say?” …\
 \
 (line 70) He climbed into the cutter and pulled over his lap the balding buffalo robe he found\
 there; the scallop (scallop — curve) of its felt edges was like a key that fitted a door. The horses breathed jets\
 of steam in the moonlight, restlessly moving, jingling their harness bells, as the moment\
 lengthened itself. The traveler saw how the boy, now that his anxiety was somewhat quieted,\
 now that he had been able to unload part of his burden, watched him with a thousand\
 (line 75) questions in his face, and he remembered how he himself, thirty years ago, had searched\
 the faces of passing strangers for something he could not name, how he had listened to their\
 steps and seen their shadows lengthen ahead of them down roads that led to unimaginable\
 places, and how he had ached with the desire to know them, who they were. But none of\
 them had looked back at him as he tried now to look at this boy. …\
 \
 (line 80) For half a breath he was utterly bewitched, frozen at the heart of some icy dream.\
 Abruptly he slapped the reins across the backs of the horses; the cutter jerked and then slid\
 smoothly out toward the road. The traveler looked back once, to fix forever the picture of\
 himself standing silently watching himself go. As he slid into the road the horses broke into\
 a trot. The icy flow of air locked his throat and made him let go the reins with one hand to\
 (line 85) pull the hairy, wool-smelling edge of the blanket all but shut across his face.\
 \
 Along a road he had never driven he went swiftly toward an unknown farm and an\
 unknown town, to distribute according to some wise law part of the burden of the boy’s\
 emergency and his own; but he bore (bore — carried) in his mind, bright as moonlight over snow, a vivid\
 wonder, almost an awe. For from that most chronic and incurable of ills, identity, he had\
 (line 90) looked outward and for one unmistakable instant recognized himself.\
 \

Excerpt from The Call of Coney Island\
 \
 by Cynthia Overbeck Bix\
 \
 (paragraph 1) Salty ocean smells mingle with the aromas of sweet cotton candy and Nathan’s Famous hot dogs. The legendary Cyclone roller coaster lurches along its tracks—then takes a heart-stopping plunge. Riders whoop and scream with excitement. Farther down the boardwalk, the sound of a carousel starts. Patrons pitch balls at moving targets, hoping to win a prize. Welcome to Coney Island, the nation’s first truly modern amusement area.\
 \
 (paragraph 2) Located on the southern tip of Brooklyn, New York, Coney Island has been the place to go for fun for more than a century. The inspiration for amusement parks such as Coney Island sprang from an exciting event in 1893—the World’s Columbian Exposition in Chicago. It was one of the first venues where people experienced a variety of attractions in one large space. \
 \
 (paragraph 3) Visitors to Chicago gasped in wonder when they saw the fair’s “White City” spread out before them. Beautiful all-white exhibition buildings and large classical statues framed a lagoon of shimmering water. Designed to educate and inform, about a dozen grand buildings housed displays on the latest developments in transportation, machinery, agriculture, art, horticulture, and more. Most visitors had never seen the things they saw there, such as electric lights, a moving sidewalk, world-famous artwork, and moving pictures.\
 \
 (paragraph 4) While the World’s Columbian Exposition awed people with new innovations and ideas, its most popular attraction was the Midway Plaisance. Located in a separate section of the exhibition grounds, the Midway was filled with entertainment: rides, food stands, and sideshows. People could get a taste of international cultures, for example, by riding a camel through the Streets of Cairo or strolling among the thatched huts of a South Sea village. Best of all, they could ride George Ferris’s giant spinning wheel. Rising 264 feet above the Midway, this engineering marvel became the star of the fair. It was a spectacular example of what the new age of machines made possible.\
 \
 (paragraph 5) One visitor, New York showman George C. Tilyou, immediately saw potential for this new form of entertainment. Tilyou owned property on Coney Island, which already was an established beach resort with hotels, bathhouses, and restaurants. It also featured an odd collection of sideshows, food vendors, fortunetellers, and more. Tilyou decided to build an enclosed amusement park there.\
 \
 (paragraph 6) In 1897, Tilyou opened Steeplechase Park. When he was unable to buy Ferris’s wheel, he had his own version built. For 25 cents, visitors could ride Tilyou’s wheel, enjoy the Scenic Railway, or climb into a “spaceship” for a Trip to the Moon. On the Steeplechase, wooden horses carried riders along a metal racetrack from a starting gate to a finish line.\
 \
 (paragraph 7) Steeplechase Park’s huge success was partly due to another invention—electric railways. The first electric trolley line had connected Manhattan Island and Coney Island in the mid-1800s. By the turn of the 20th century, an electric train offered an even faster way to carry more people wanting to escape from the hot, crowded city.\
 \
 (paragraph 8) In the late 1800s and early 1900s, most people worked long hours and six days a week in urban factories and shops. But for a nickel fare, a city worker could afford a day’s outing to a nearby park on Sundays. Recognizing the value of giving the working class access to day trips, trolley and train companies established parks that were located at the end of a line. Travelers disembarked to enjoy simple outdoor pleasures in picnic groves and swimming pools or beaches. Eventually, merry-go-rounds, penny arcades, (penny arcades - indoor area with amusements such as games and photo booths operated by placing a coin in a slot) and even small roller coasters were added. . . .\
 \
 (paragraph 9) Part sideshow, part circus, part theme park, Coney Island set an example for amusement parks. Attractions that are so familiar today—roller coasters, water rides, fun houses, Tunnels of Love—all got their start there.\
 \
 (paragraph 10) Many amusement parks closed during the Great Depression in the 1930s or during World War II (1939–1945). Coney Island has had its ups and downs, too. Over the decades, fires and age destroyed some of the original attractions. In 2012, Superstorm Sandy wrecked the boardwalk and many of the attractions.\
 \
 (paragraph 11) In spite of all that, Coney Island has survived, and it is still operating today. It continues to offer each new generation of kids (and their parents) a chance to escape to a special world of entertainment and thrills. And from New Jersey’s Wildwood Park to California’s Pacific Park and Florida’s Walt Disney World, other amusement and theme parks have taken their cues from Coney Island. They have grown to epic proportions in their efforts to offer a world full of fun.\
Which statement expresses a central idea developed throughout the article?\
(A) The Coney Island amusement park was initially separated by different types of entertainment.\
 (B) The World’s Columbian Exposition had many elements that were later used in the Coney Island amusement park.\
 (C) The Coney Island amusement park was influenced by previous attractions and eventually impacted the modern amusement park.\
 (D) Thee invention of the electric railway was important to the popularity of the Coney Island amusement park.\

Reading Comprehension Passage C\
 Many Animals Can Count, Some Better Than You\
 \
 Every night during breeding season, the male túngara frog of Central America will stake\
 out a performance patch in the local pond and spend unbroken hours broadcasting\
 his splendor to the world.\
 The mud-brown frog is barely the size of a shelled pecan, but his call is large and\
 (line 5) dynamic, a long downward sweep that sounds remarkably like a phaser weapon on\
 \"Star Trek,\" followed by a brief, twangy, harmonically dense chuck.(chuck - a clucking sound)\
 Unless, that is, a competing male starts calling nearby, in which case the first frog is\
 likely to add two chucks to the tail of his sweep. And should his rival respond likewise,\
 Male A will tack on three chucks.\
 (line 10) Back and forth they go, call and raise, until the frogs hit their respiratory limit at six\
 to seven rapid-fire chucks.\
 The acoustic one-upfrogship is energetically draining and risks attracting predators like\
 bats. Yet the male frogs have no choice but to keep count of the competition, for the simple\
 reason that female túngaras are doing the same: listening, counting and ultimately mating\
 (line 15) with the male of maximum chucks.\
 Behind the frog’s surprisingly sophisticated number sense, scientists have found, are\
 specialized cells in the amphibian midbrain that tally up sound signals and the intervals\
 between them.\
 \"The neurons are counting the number of appropriate pulses, and they’re highly\
 (line 20) selective,\" said Gary Rose, a biologist at the University of Utah. If the timing between\
 pulses is off by just a fraction of a second, the neurons don’t fire and the counting process\
 breaks down. …\
 Scientists have found that animals across the evolutionary spectrum have a keen sense\
 of quantity, able to distinguish not just bigger from smaller or more from less, but two from\
 (line 25) four, four from ten, forty from sixty.\
 Orb-weaving spiders, for example, keep a tally of how many silk-wrapped prey items are\
 stashed in the \"larder\" segment of their web. When scientists experimentally remove the\
 cache, the spiders will spend time searching for the stolen goods in proportion to how many\
 separate items had been taken, rather than how big the total prey mass might have been.\
 (line 30) Small fish benefit from living in schools, and the more numerous the group, the\
 statistically better a fish’s odds of escaping predation. As a result, many shoaling (shoaling - shallow water) fish are\
 excellent appraisers of relative head counts.\
 Guppies, for example, have a so-called contrast ratio of .8, which means they can\
 distinguish at a glance between four guppies and five, or eight guppies and ten, and if given\
 (line 35) the chance will swim toward the slightly fishier crowd.\
 Three-spined sticklebacks (sticklebacks - carnivorous fish) are more discriminating still: with a contrast ratio of .86,\
 they’re able to tell six fellow fish from seven, or 18 from 21 — a comparative power that\
 many birds, mammals and even humans might find hard to beat.\
 Despite the prevalence of math phobia, people too are born with a strong innate\
 (line 40) number sense, and numerosity is deeply embedded in many aspects of our minds and\
 culture.\
 Researchers have determined that number words for small quantities — less than five —\
 are strikingly similar across virtually every language studied, and the words are among the\
 most stable, unchanging utterances in any lexicon. (lexicon - language)\
 (line 45) They are more conserved through time and across cultures than words for other\
 presumably bedrock concepts like mother, father and most body parts, with a few puzzling\
 exceptions like the words for tongue and eye.\
 \"The sounds that you and I use to say ‘two’ or ‘three’ are the sounds that have been used\
 for tens of thousands of years,\" said Mark Pagel, a biologist who studies the evolution of\
 (line 50) language at the University of Reading.\
 \"It’s not out of the question that you could have been wandering around 15,000 years\
 ago and encountered a few of the last remaining Neanderthals, pointed to yourself and said,\
 ‘one,’ and pointed to them and said, ‘three,’ and those words, in an odd, coarse way, would\
 have been understood.\"\
 (line 55) That continuity, Dr. Pagel added, \"should astonish us.\" …\
 Attitudes about animal numerosity have changed dramatically since the mid-twentieth\
 century when many researchers believed only humans had enough gray matter to think\
 quantitatively. They cited as an object lesson the 1907 case of Clever Hans, the horse that\
 supposedly could solve arithmetic problems and would tap out his answers by hoof; as it\
 (line 60) turned out, he was responding to unconscious cues from the people around him.\
 Since then, researchers have approached the field with caution and rigor, seeking to\
 identify the specific evolutionary pressures that might spur the need for numeric judgments\
 in any given species.\
 Social carnivores like spotted hyenas, for example, live in fission-fusion societies, (fission-fusion societies - animals whose social group composition and size change as they move throughout their environment)\
 (line 65) collectively defending their territories against rivals but in ever-shifting groups of widely\
 roaming members. \"You can never predict who you’ll find in which group,\" said Sarah\
 Benson-Amram, an assistant professor of zoology and physiology at the University of\
 Wyoming. \"You might be alone or in a group of ten.\"\
 Because hyena jaws can pulverize zebra bones, encounters between [rival hyena]\
 (line 70) competitors can prove deadly; every spotted hyena must have a good sense from moment\
 to moment of how many there are of us versus how many of them. Dr. Benson-Amram and\
 her colleagues tested hyena numerosity skills in the field, playing back the recorded whoops\
 of spotted hyenas living in South Africa and Namibia to hyenas in Kenya.\
 The Kenyan carnivores reacted to the whoops of strangers as predicted, approaching\
 (line 75)\
 the hidden source of the sound when they had a home team advantage, retreating when\
 they heard a few too many distinctive voices in a row. Or sometimes, when the local hyenas\
 were outnumbered, they’d call for backup. …\
 Chimpanzees are social scorekeepers, episodic (episodic - periodic) warriors and number ninjas, too.\
 They can be taught to associate groups of objects with corresponding Arabic numerals up\
 (line 80) to the number 9 and sometimes beyond — three squares on a computer screen with the\
 number 3, five squares with 5, and so on. They can put those numerals in order.\
 The numeric working memory of young chimpanzees is astonishing: Flash a random\
 scattering of numerals on a screen for just 210 milliseconds — half an eye blink — and then\
 cover the numbers with white squares, and a numerically schooled young chimpanzee will\
 (line 85) touch the squares sequentially to indicate the ascending order of the numbers hidden\
 beneath.\
 Don’t bother trying to do this yourself, Tetsuro Matsuzawa, a primatologist at Kyoto\
 University, said at the scientific meeting in London on which the themed journal (the themed journal - a publication where animal numerosity studies were discussed) was based.\
 \"You can’t.\" …\
 (line 90) Stanislas Dehaene, a psychologist at the University of Paris, and his colleagues\
 presented evidence from brain scans of professional mathematicians that the neural\
 circuitry (neural circuitry - nerve cells) for advanced mathematical thinking is an elaboration on the archaic (archaic - primitive) number sense\
 we share with other animals. …\
 We hear that the price of something rose by 50 percent and then fell by 50 percent, and\
 (line 95) we reflexively, mistakenly conclude, \"Oh good, we’re back to where we started.\" Our natural\
 number sense adds and subtracts whole numbers, whole chucks, guppies and hyenas.\
 But it really abhors a fraction, and so has led us astray.\

 excerpted and adapted from \"Many Animals Can Count, Some Better Than You\"\
 The New York Times, February 5, 2018\
Lines 7 through 11 suggest that the number of chucks are\

The Diving Horse\
 by John B. Abbott, Jr.\
 \
 Fall of 1959. That was the year Fidel Castro seized power in Cuba; Alaska and Hawaii\
 joined the Union as our 49th and 50th states, respectively; and Gunsmoke reigned as the\
 top TV series. Charlton Heston collected an Academy Award for Ben-Hur, and Leon Uris’s\
 Exodus topped the reading lists. In Garwood, New Jersey, a child picked up his favorite\
 (line 5) Golden Books (Golden Books were known as Little Golden Books, a popular series of children’s books that had gold-foil bindings.) and stood outside of his parents’ apartment building, waiting for the\
 school bus. What a sight: a chubby boy in black high-top Keds, jeans, and a flannel shirt,\
 patiently waiting and watching for the bus that, when it finally did rumble down Willow\
 Avenue, passed him by. The driver didn’t think to stop, which made perfect sense since\
 her route schedule didn’t include three-year-olds—not even three-year-old me.\
 (line 10) “The bus didn’t stop for me,” I complained to my mother that day.\
 “Oh, really?” she calmly replied. Later she would say that the only surprise was\
 the age at which I wanted to start going to school. But it shouldn’t have surprised her\
 really, because as the son of a pair of avid readers, I grew up in a house abundant with\
 opportunities to read and write. Newspapers, magazines, television, and radio were\
 (line 15) always available.\
 When I finally reached school age and the bus did stop, high drama and adventure\
 made up most of my extracurricular reading. I would read and reread Classics Illustrated\
 comics, and authors like Daniel Defoe, Mark Twain, Arthur Conan Doyle, Washington\
 Irving, Edgar Rice Burroughs, and Frank W. Dixon. I also enjoyed Superman and Batman\
 (line 20) comic books and even went through a MAD magazine phase. Sometimes Mom had to\
 chase me out of the house after school to play, because I would have rather just stayed in\
 my room and read.\
 I wasn’t much on writing until I was enrolled in a Catholic school, St. Bernard’s.\
 There, the nuns were stereotypically tough but thorough educators. In third grade, I\
 (line 25) labored long and hard with Sister Mary, and while it was her thoroughness that led to my\
 discovering that I loved to write, it was a horse—the Diving Horse of Atlantic City—that\
 sparked a lifetime passion for writing.\
 At the beginning of that school year, Sister Mary had assigned to us the ubiquitous\
 essay about summer vacation. That summer, my family had taken a day trip to the\
 (line 30) original Steel Pier in Atlantic City to see the famous Diving Horse. How my parents\
 learned of the horse, I don’t know, but as a family that took all its vacations by automobile,\
 no doubt they were alert for local-yet-unusual attractions. Atlantic City must have been\
 appealing; in the 1960s, there were no casinos or nightlife per se—unless you count Frank\
 Sinatra, Jr.—but the town was mostly known for its family-oriented amusements and the\
 (line 35) tradition of Bert Parks crooning his welcome to Miss America. But for us, Bert paled in\
 comparison to the Diving Horse. So off we went in the white ’64 Pontiac to climb aboard\
 carnival rides and eat hamburgers.\
 Thinking back on that day, I remember the windburn I got on my forearms from the\
 cool salty breeze off the Atlantic—a first for me. And to this day, I can’t go to the Jersey\
 (line 40) Shore without bringing home a box of fresh saltwater taffy.\
 But above all, I remember anxiously getting bleacher seats to see the Diving Horse. As\
 we took our seats, the horse, with a fellow named Arnette Webster (The author’s recollection of the diver appears to be inaccurate. Arnette French, a woman who performed in horse diving shows, stopped performing in 1935.) (clad in a rubber wet\
 suit) on its back, was about to jump from a platform roughly 30 feet high into a pool. I\
 recall staring at the odd sight of a horse standing as calmly as you please on a platform\
 (line 45) above a pool just like the kind I swam in at my Aunt Anne and Uncle Leo’s house. To a\
 recorded drumroll and cymbal crash, Webster urged the horse forward, and the two fell\
 through space to make the biggest splash I’d ever seen—even bigger than the cannonballs\
 my uncle could make in his own pool! Wow! And then both horse and rider surfaced,\
 though for the life of me, I can’t recall how they got out of the pool.\
 (line 50) So two months later, when Sister Mary gave us the essay assignment, it was easy . . . as\
 easy as falling into a pool.\
 Looking at the Diving Horse essay some 40 years later, it’s apparent how much I must\
 have enjoyed writing about the experience. I put a lot of energy into trying to describe the\
 windburn, the taffy, and the horse, which, to my eight-year-old eyes, must have been\
 (line 55) suitable for a Valkyrie to ride. But in that essay, I did something that I imagine no other\
 child in the class did: I ended my piece with a rhetorical question. I wrote, “How would\
 you like to go to Atlantic City?”\
 Small as that detail was, Sister Mary must have noticed it. And she must have\
 encouraged me to keep writing, because with that essay, I learned something about myself.\
 (line 60) I learned that I loved to write.\
 It was at that age, as my father has confirmed, that I started to write stories, not just\
 read them. I soon took to writing as I had taken to reading. I wrote about monsters,\
 superheroes, and what could pass for a fourth-grader’s version of a mystery. Superman\
 never had it so easy foiling the best-laid plans of Lex Luthor, and my detectives—not as\
 (line 65) articulate as Sherlock Holmes, but as savvy—somehow always managed to catch the bad\
 guys and still remember to say “Thank you.”\
 Even now, when many of my workdays at Rutgers University are done, Rex Stout,\
 Mark Twain, Arthur Conan Doyle, and Superman are still often at the center of my\
 recreational reading. And when I write a mystery, whatever thread each of my various\
 (line 70) detectives picks up and untangles, something inside reminds me of the chubby kid with\
 the glasses urging the horse to “Jump! Jump!”\
 In terms of distance, it was about 30 feet. In terms of writing, it was a leap of\
 a lifetime.\
The details in lines 38 through 49 develop a theme of the passage by showing\
(A) how experiences can be more exciting than stories\
 (B) that memories can be both powerful and detailed\
 (C) that the past can feel more intense than the present\
 (D) how spending time with family is important\

Reading Comprehension Passage B\
 \
 A Dream of Mountaineering\
 The following poem was written by a revered 8th century Chinese poet (701–762 AD)\
 \
 At night, in my dream, I stoutly climbed a mountain, \
 Going out alone with my staff of holly-wood. (staff of holly-wood - a walking stick)\
 A thousand crags, a hundred hundred valleys— \
 In my dream-journey none were unexplored \
 (line 5) And all the while my feet never grew tired \
 And my step was as strong as in my young days. \
 Can it be that when the mind travels backward \
 The body also returns to its old state? \
 And can it be, as between body and soul,\
 (line 10) That the body may languish, while the soul is still strong? \
 Soul and body—both are vanities: (vanities -superficial things)\
 Dreaming and waking—both alike unreal. \
 In the day my feet are palsied (palsied - shaking) and tottering; \
 In the night my steps go striding over the hills.\
 (line 15) As day and night are divided in equal parts— \
 Between the two, I get as much as I lose. \

Excerpt from A la Carte\
 by Tanita S. Davis\
 \
 (paragraph 1) “Homework?” My mother mouths the word exaggeratedly, eyebrows raised, and I\
 roll my eyes. Frowning, she points with her chin to the side door that leads to the stairs.\
 I roll my eyes again, mouthing, Okay, okay, not needing her to pantomime further what\
 she wants me to do. I hate the thought of leaving the clattering nerve center of the\
 restaurant to wrestle with my trigonometry homework in my mother’s quiet office\
 downstairs.\
 (paragraph 2) \"Order!\"\
 (paragraph 3) The bright lights and swirl of noise and motion are muffled as the kitchen door\
 swings closed behind me.\
 (paragraph 4) It’s hard to remember a time when the restaurant hasn’t been the center of our lives.\
 Mom used to be a copy editor and wrote food features for our local paper, the Clarion,\
 and she met Pia when she did a write-up on the culinary school Pia attended. Pia\
 thinks it was fate that Mom wanted to invest in a restaurant at the same time Pia\
 wanted to buy the old bank building.\
 (paragraph 5) La Salle Rouge doesn’t serve much in the way of “kid” food, since the menu doesn’t\
 cater to people my age on a cheap date, but I’ve loved everything about it from the first.\
 I started experimenting with being a vegetarian when I turned fourteen, but Pia still\
 found things to feed me and taught me to be creative with vegetables and tofu. I like to\
 think I’m the best-fed vegetarian in the state of California.\
 (paragraph 6) Pia’s been really good about teaching what she knows, and I decided early on that\
 this is the work I want to do—get out of school and get into the kitchen for good. Mom\
 and Pia have created a popular French-Asian-Californian fusion restaurant that has\
 gotten great reviews from food critics. They took the best of each other’s tastes—\
 Mom’s traditional Southern flavors and Pia’s French training combined with her\
 vegetable- and spice-savvy Cambodian tastes—and pulled off what one food critic\
 called “stylized food with unique flavor combinations in an intimate setting.”\
 (paragraph 7) Whatever that means.\
 (paragraph 8) Three years ago, when I started high school thirty pounds heavier than everyone in\
 my class, Mom and I came up with a light menu for La Salle Rouge, and it’s been such a\
 popular idea that Mom lets me come up with tasty, low-calorie desserts, which is one of\
 my favorite things to do. It hardly seems fair that I have to walk away from all of that\
 just to do trigonometry, but my mom says I have to finish school before I concentrate\
 on cooking. She says it’s smarter to have a “backup plan,” and she’s made me apply to\
 plenty of colleges and check out business majors just in case I ever want to do anything\
 else with my life. I guess that makes sense if you’re anybody other than me. When I\
 turn eighteen, I already know what I’m going to do.\
 (paragraph 9) First, I’m going to buy a plane ticket to D.C. and go to Julia Child’s kitchen at the\
 Smithsonian and leave roses. They don’t let you walk through it, but somewhere—I\
 don’t know where—I’m going to leave a bouquet and a little note for her. Julia Child is\
 my patron saint (patron saint: an inspiring person admired for his or her work). She’s the queen of all reasons people can do anything they want in\
 life. Saint Julia didn’t start cooking until she was practically forty, and she went on to\
 do TV shows and make cookbooks and be this huge part of culinary history. She never\
 got too fancy, she never freaked out, and she was never afraid to try new things. I want\
 to be just like her—except maybe get famous faster.\
 (paragraph 10) The second thing I’m going to do is buy myself a set of knives. Pia swears by this set\
 of German steel knives she got when she graduated, but I’ve seen the TV chef Kylie\
 Kwong use a phenomenal-looking ceramic knife on her show on the Discovery\
 Channel. Either way, knives are what the best chefs have of their very own.\
 (paragraph 11) The third thing I’m going to do, after I get back from Washington and get my knives,\
 is . . . get discovered. Somehow. I know I’m going to have to pay my dues, but I’m so\
 ready for my real life to start. It’s not something I admit to a lot, but my real dream is to\
 be a celebrity chef. Do you know how many African American female chefs there\
 aren’t? And how many vegetarian chefs have their own shows? The field is wide open\
 for stardom. Every time I watch old episodes of Saint Julia, I imagine that I have my\
 own cooking show. The way celebrity chefs do it now, I could also have a line of\
 cooking gear, cookbooks, aprons, the works. People would know my name, ask for my\
 autograph, and try my recipes. All I have to do is finish my trig homework and get back\
 into the kitchen.\
Which quotation best expresses a central idea of the story?\
(A) “I started experimenting with being a vegetarian when I turned fourteen . . .” (paragraph 5)\
 (B) “. . . I decided early on that this is the work I want to do . . .” (paragraph 6)\
 (C) “It hardly seems fair that I have to walk away from all of that . . .” (paragraph 8)\

Talking with Artists:\
 David Wiesner\
 compiled and edited by Pat Cummings\
 MY STORY\
 (paragraph 1) I think that I always knew I wanted to become an artist. I can't remember a time when I wasn't drawing and painting pictures. My oldest sister and my brother were artistic, and watching them draw fascinated me. They had many different art supplies around the house. There was, and still is, something very appealing about art materials: Boxes of pastels, with incredibly colored, thin, square sticks, fitting snugly into the slots in their trays. Little ink bottles with rubber stoppers and pens with interchangeable metal tips. The look, smell, and feel of rich black ink going onto bright white paper in broad, flat strokes or thin, sharp lines. I found this captivating.\
 (paragraph 2) In our town, the housepaint and wallpaper store also sold art supplies. I loved looking at all the exotic things they had for sale. Sandpaper blocks to sharpen pencils. Rows of numbered pencils, and erasers that could be pulled ike taffy. Thin drawers full of tubes of paint that seemed so much more grown up than the kind we used at school. Complicated easels and wooden boxes to hold everything.\
 (paragraph 3) My parents and friends soon saw that I had more than a passing interest in art. It came to define much of my image. Relatives gave me art-related birthday gifts. At school I became \"the kid who could draw\", a unique distinction, like \"brainiest\" or \"best athlete\"-but somehow different. A little weird, actually. I like that.\
 (paragraph 4) In my kindergarten class, we had an \"art corner\". There was an easel with a large pad of paper and poster paints. One day I was painting a picture of a red house. I can vividly recall my intense frustration because this picture just didn't look like I wanted it to.\
 (paragraph 5) As I got a little older, I began copying pictures: cartoons, comic books, and magazine illustrations. But mostly dinosaurs. I loved them. The World Book Encyclopedia published a book about the history of the earth, full of very realistic dinosaur pictures that I drew over and over again. They were in black and white and had a hazy quality to them (bad printing, I think). For a long time, even after I should have known better, I thought they were photographs of dinosaurs.\
 (paragraph 6) I found out a few years ago that these particular paintings are murals in the Chicago Field Museum. I've since seen them in person. They were painted by Charles Knight, the first and most famous painter of dinosaurs. They are still impressive, and they are in color!\
 (paragraph 7) My third-grade class wrote essays on what we wanted to be when we grew up. To me it was obvious. We read them aloud, and I told about the types of paintings I would some day try. I'd have turtles with paintbrushes tied to their backs walking around on a big sheet of paper (I got chuckles from the class and the teacher). Or I'd fill squirt guns with different colored paints and shoot at the canvas. I actually tried this with friends! Well, it sounded like a good idea.\
 (paragraph 8) One of the only discouraging childhood experiences about my artwork happened in the fourth grade. During study time I was drawing a picture. My teacher took it away and wrote an angry note home to my mother. \"David would rather be drawing pictures than doing his work!!!\" I couldn't believe it, three exclamation points. We didn't get along well for the rest of the year. School \"art classes\" were pretty uninspiring. I did my best work on textbook covers I made. Art never seemed to be taken as seriously as other subjects.\
 (paragraph 9) In the eighth grade, a big career day was held. Months before, we wrote suggestions for careers we wanted to hear about. On the big day, guest speakers from many fields came to talk. We each chose two sessions to attend, but there wasn't one that came close to an art-related field. I saw some guy talk about oceanography.\
 (paragraph 10) In high school it actually sank in that I was going to be an artist. My friends read catalogs and saw guidance counselors to pick what they'd study in college. I felt something was wrong. I already knew. I'd always known. I half expected to hear, \"No, put away those paints and choose a real career.\" My parents were excited about my choice, too. As I looked into art schools, I felt like doors were being thrown wide open. Until then my art was a private thing, but at art school I found a place where everyone was \"the kid who could draw.\"\
Which statement is most important to include in a summary of the passage?\
(A) Wiesner was always interested in drawing and painting pictures.\
 (B) Wiesner was entertained by the process of drawing with black ink on white paper.\
 (C) Wiesner was always pleased to receive art-related gifts for his birthday.\
 (D) Wiesner was disappointed because no speaker came to talk about art-related fields.\

I know I’m going to have to pay my dues, but I’m so ready for my real life to start. It’s not something I admit to a lot, but my real dream is to be a celebrity chef. Do you know how many African American female chefs there aren’t? And how many vegetarian chefs have their own shows? The field is wide open for stardom. Every time I watch old episodes of Saint Julia, I imagine that I have my own cooking show. The way celebrity chefs do it now, I could also have a line of cooking gear, cookbooks, aprons, the works. People would know my name, ask for my autograph, and try my recipes. All I have to do is finish my trig homework and get back into the kitchen.\

Excerpt from Humans With Amazing Senses\
 \
 When bats go out to hunt, they send out sonar signals at such high frequencies and in\
 such rapid bursts that they can hear the signals bounce off mosquitoes in midair. They\
 then zero in on the insects like laser-guided missiles. Dolphins use the same technique to\
 find their dinners. It’s called echolocation, a technique that uses sound to identify objects\
 (line 5) by the echoes they produce.\
 Fourteen-year-old Ben Underwood of Sacramento, Calif., is one of the few people\
 known to use echolocation as a primary means of navigating the world on land. There’s\
 not even a hint of light reaching his brain. His eyes are artificial, but his brain has adapted\
 to allow him to appraise his environment. He makes a “clicking” sound to communicate\
 (line 10) with objects and people around him.\
 Scientists have discovered that in the brains of the blind, the visual cortex has not\
 become useless, as they once believed. When blind people use another sense—touch or\
 hearing, for example—to substitute for sight, the brain’s visual cortex becomes active, even\
 though no images reach it from the optic nerve. Echolocation creates its own images.\
 (line 15) “I can hear that wall behind you over there. I can hear right there—the radio, and the\
 fan,” Ben says.\
 Ben says every object in his life talks to him in ways that no one else can hear\
 or understand.\
 Forty-year-old Daniel Kish of Long Beach, Calif., also uses echolocation, and has\
 (line 20) become an expert on it, founding the World Access for the Blind, an organization that\
 teaches others how to echolocate. Kish leads other blind people on mountain biking tours\
 and hikes in the wilderness, visualizing and describing the picturesque sights around him\
 through echolocating.\
 Clicking to Do Anything\
 If you listen closely to Ben or Kish, you can hear how they find their way. Ben says he\
 (line 25) can distinguish where the curbs are as he cruises his neighborhood streets.\
 He can find the pole and the backboard on a basketball goal, and tell which is which\
 by the distinctive echo each makes. Even though he can’t see the goal he’s aiming for, he\
 can sink a basket. Ben doesn’t remember how or when he began clicking, but he’s\
 developed his abilities to such an extent that aside from echolocation, he can rapidly\
 (line 30) discriminate the sounds in video games.\
 Ben lost his sight when he was 2. He was diagnosed with cancer in both eyes, and\
 when chemotherapy failed, his mother, Aquanetta Gordon, was left with one option: For\
 her son to live, both his eyes had to be surgically removed.\
 Gordon remembers her son after the operation.\
 (line 35) “He woke up and he said, ‘Mom, I can’t see anymore, I can’t see anymore.’ And I took\
 his hands and I put them on my face and I said, ‘Baby, yes, you can see.’ I said, ‘You can\
 see with your hands.’ And then I put my hand on his nose and I said, ‘You smell me? You\
 can see with your nose and your ears. . . . You can’t use your eyes anymore, but you have\
 your hands and your nose and your ears.’ ”\
 (line 40) In a house already filled with three other children, Ben’s mother decided not to treat\
 his blindness as a handicap. In school, Ben recognizes his classmates by their voices. With\
 the help of Braille books and a talking laptop computer, Ben attends the same classes as\
 sighted students.\
 Rich Mental Images, Without Visual Elements\
 Like Ben, Kish also lost his eyesight to cancer at age 1. He was raised to believe he\
 (line 45) could do pretty much anything, and he discovered clicking by accident as a child.\
 “I have mental images that are very rich, very complex. They simply do not possess\
 the visual element,” Kish says.\
 In retrieving those pictures, Kish varies the pace and volume of his clicks as he\
 walks along; and what he can tell you about an object’s qualities is sometimes\
 (line 50) astonishingly thorough.\
 If bats can distinguish prey as small as mosquitoes with echolocation, and some\
 dolphins can detect small targets a hundred yards away, what are the ultimate capabilities\
 of human beings like Ben and Kish?\
 Peter Scheifele, who studies hearing and sound production in animals and people at\
 (line 55) the University of Connecticut, analyzed samples of the clicks that Ben and Kish make.\
 “Ben clicks, looks to me like once every half second, whereas a dolphin is actually\
 making 900 clicks per second. And the bat is even faster than that,” Scheifele says.\
 The bottom line: Human beings send out sounds at much slower rates and lower\
 frequencies, so the objects people can picture with echolocation must be much larger than\
 (line 60) the ones bats and dolphins can find.\
Read Daniel Kish’s claim from line 46.\
 “I have mental images that are very rich, very complex.”\
 Which quotation from the article best supports this claim?\
(A) “. . . Kish of Long Beach, Calif., also uses echolocation, and has become an expert on it. . . .” (lines 19 and 20)\
 (B) “He was raised to believe he could do pretty much anything. . . .” (lines 44 and 45)\
 (C) “. . . Kish varies the pace and volume of his clicks as he walks along. . . .” (lines 48 and 49)\
 (D) “. . . what he can tell you about an object’s qualities is sometimes astonishingly thorough.” (lines 49 and 50)\

Excerpt from Snowflake Bentley\
 by Jacqueline Briggs Martin\
 \
 (paragraph 1) In the days when farmers worked with ox and sled and cut the dark with lantern light, there lived a boy who loved snow more than anything in the world. Willie Bentley’s happiest days were snowstorm days. He watched snowflakes on his mittens, on the dried grass of Vermont farm fields, on the dark metal handle of the barn door. He said snow was as beautiful as butterflies, or apple blossoms.\
 \
 (paragraph 2) He could net butterflies and show them to his older brother, Charlie. He could pick apple blossoms and take them to his mother. But he could not share snowflakes because he could not save them.\
 \
 (paragraph 3) When his mother gave him an old microscope, he used it to look at flowers, raindrops, and blades of grass. Best of all, he used it to look at snow. While other children built forts and pelted snowballs at roosting crows, Willie was catching snowflakes. Day after stormy day he studied the icy crystals.\
 \
 (paragraph 4) Their intricate patterns were even more beautiful than he had imagined. He expected to find whole flakes that were the same, that were copies of each other. But he never did. Willie decided he must find a way to save snowflakes so others could see their wonderful designs. For three winters he tried drawing snow crystals. They always melted before he could finish.\
 \
 (paragraph 5) When he was sixteen, Willie read of a camera with its own microscope. “If I had that camera I could photograph snowflakes,” he told his mother. Willie’s mother knew that he would not be happy until he could share what he had seen.\
 \
 (paragraph6) “Fussing with snow is just foolishness,” his father said. Still, he loved his son. When Willie was seventeen his parents spent their savings and bought the camera. It was taller than a newborn calf, and cost as much as his father’s herd of ten cows. Willie was sure it was the best of all cameras.\
 \
 (paragraph 7) Even so his first pictures were failures—no better than shadows. Yet he would not quit. Mistake by mistake, snowflake by snowflake, Willie worked through every storm. Winter ended, the snow melted, and he had no good pictures. He waited for another season of snow. One day, in the second winter, he tried a new experiment. And it\
 worked! Willie had figured out how to photograph snowflakes! “Now everyone can see the great beauty in a tiny crystal,” he said.\
 \
 (paragraph 8) But in those days, no one cared. Neighbors laughed at the idea of photographing snow. “Snow in Vermont is as common as dirt,” they said. “We don’t need pictures.” Willie said the photographs would be his gift to the world. While other farmers sat by the fire or rode to town with horse and sleigh, Willie studied snowstorms. He stood at the shed door and held out a black tray to catch the flakes.\
 \
 (paragraph 9) When he found only jumbled, broken crystals, he brushed the tray clean with a turkey feather and held it out again. He waited hours for just the right crystal and didn’t notice the cold. If the shed were warm the snow would melt. If he breathed on the black tray the snow would melt. If he twitched a muscle as he held the snow crystal on the long wood pick the snowflake would break. He had to work fast or the snowflake would evaporate before he could slide it into place and take its picture. Some winters he was able to make only a few dozen good pictures. Some winters he made hundreds. . . .\
 \
 (paragraph 10) But his snow crystal pictures were always his favorites. He gave copies away or sold them for a few cents. He made special pictures as gifts for birthdays. He held evening slide shows on the lawns of his friends. Children and adults sat on the grass and watched while Willie projected his slides onto a sheet hung over a clothesline.\
 \
 (paragraph 11) He wrote about snow and published his pictures in magazines. He gave speeches about snow to faraway scholars and neighborhood skywatchers. “You are doing great work,” said a professor from Wisconsin. The little farmer came to be known as the world’s expert on snow, “the Snowflake Man.” But he never grew rich. He spent every\
 penny on his pictures. Willie said there were treasures in snow. “I can’t afford to miss a single snowstorm,” he told a friend. “I never know when I will find some wonderful prize.”\
Which statement is true based on the information in paragraphs 6 and 11?\
(A) Bentley’s work with snow required expensive equipment that he was willing to spend all his money on.\
 (B) Bentley was thought to be foolish throughout his life because of his interest in snow.\
 (C) Bentley’s parents thought he should do something with his life other than taking pictures of snow.\
 (D) Bentley became less interested in studying snow than in publishing pictures and giving speeches.\

Clash of the Condiments: Wasabi vs. the Chili Pepper\
 by Mary Beth Cox\
 \
 Most condiments are peaceable enough. The sauces, spreads, and pickles of the world\
 add flavor to our foods without kicking up much of a fuss. This is not true of the pungent\
 or “hot’’ condiments. They are more aggressive. They get our attention by purposely\
 causing us pain. These strong-armed seasonings are often the source of friendly\
 (line 5) competitions. Loyal fans will contend that their favorite pungent condiment is the one that\
 packs the most powerful punch. Ladies and gentlemen, you are cordially welcomed to just\
 such a contest. Here it is, the Match of the Moment: Wasabi vs. the Chili Pepper.\
 IN YOUR CORNERS\
 Introducing in the Green Corner, hailing from the island nation of Japan, sushi’s\
 inseparable sidekick: Wasabi! Wasabia japonica grows wild on the cool, damp banks of\
 (line 10) Japan’s many mountain streams. The chill of its habitat is quite ironic since wasabi is\
 famous for bringing the heat. The plant is a botanical relative of mustard and horseradish.\
 Pungency runs in the family. Traditionally, wasabi is prepared by grating its rootstock on\
 the abrasive skin of an angel shark. Authentic wasabi is relatively rare and difficult to\
 come by. The emerald condiment that is served outside of Japan is almost always\
 (line 15) horseradish pulp dyed with green food coloring. Whether the wasabi is real or whether it’s\
 the more common substitute, a whopping snootful will make you cry for your momma!\
 And in the red corner, originating from the Central and South Americas, now an\
 international culinary superstar: the Chili Pepper. Chili peppers are fruits of the plants of\
 the botanical genus Capsicum. They are related to the tomato and the eggplant. They’re\
 (line 20) the renegades in an otherwise mild-mannered botanical family. Chili peppers include but\
 are not limited to the poblano, the cayenne, the jalapeño, the tabasco, the habanero, and\
 the serrano. One of these culprits sometimes goes by the alias “chipotle.’’ A chipotle\
 (pronounced chee-POHT-lay) is none other than a dried smoked jalape ño. Chilies were\
 introduced to the non-American world by Christopher Columbus, who mistakenly\
 (line 25) identified them as variants of black pepper. Chilies have since taken the culinary world by\
 storm. They appear alongside dishes served around the globe, from the Basque provinces\
 to North Africa and the Middle East, to India and Southeast Asia. A potent chili pepper in\
 the kisser will make you rue the day you were born!\
 POWERFUL PUNCHES\
 Both wasabi and chilies are condiments of world-class pungency. But how do they\
 (line 30) match up head to head? Each has its own unique tactical move. Each has its own special\
 point of attack. The active ingredient of the wasabi plant is stored stealthily in its cells.\
 Under normal growing conditions, this ingredient is completely harmless. It’s not until the\
 plant’s cells are ruptured (as by the grating action of angel shark skin) that the trouble\
 begins. Enzymes convert the ingredient into molecules of allyl isothiocyanate. It’s the\
 (line 35) chemical characteristics of these irritating molecules that are the secret to wasabi’s\
 pungency. Allyl isothiocyanate molecules are lightweight. They are volatile. They are also\
 soluble in water. As a consequence, the consumption of wasabi launches an airborne\
 assault on the consumer’s sinuses. Allyl isothiocyanate molecules waft up the nose and\
 back of the throat. They dissolve in the watery fluids they find there. They intercept nerve\
 (line 40) endings in the nasal passages. Specifically, these molecules target pain receptors of the\
 type known as TRPA I . TRPA I receptors respond to the attack by sending emergency\
 signals to the brain: “Yikes . . . we’ve gotten hold of something painfully hot!’’\
 Chili peppers conduct operations of a different sort. Their active ingredient is a\
 substance called capsaicin. It’s found in the spongy inner tissue of peppers, but it can leak\
 (line 45) onto the seeds and inner wall of the fruit. Capsaicin molecules are heavier than the\
 molecules of wasabi’s allyl isothiocyanate. They are not volatile. They prefer to dissolve in\
 oils, so they aren’t as easily dissolved in water. Capsaicin molecules instigate an incendiary\
 assault upon contact with exposed vulnerable surfaces. They cling to the tender tissues of\
 the lips, mouth, and throat. They burn eyes that are rubbed with capsaicin-laced fingers.\
 (line 50) Capsaicin molecules interact with pain receptors of the type TRPV I. Again an alert is\
 expedited to the brain: “Mayday! Mayday! Let’s not eat any more of that, please!’’\
 WHERE’S THE REFEREE?\
 So which of these condiments causes the most pain? To settle any contest, a scoring\
 system is required. There is a way to compare the relative heat intensities of the various\
 chili peppers. It’s called the Scoville scale. Scoville ratings are determined by brave human\
 (line 55) test subjects who willingly sip extracts of chili pepper juice. Extracted juices are diluted\
 again and again until their heat can no longer be detected. A high rating on the Scoville\
 scale means that a lot of dilutions are necessary to eliminate the pain caused by a\
 particular pepper. Unfortunately, Scoville ratings are not applicable to wasabi. The method\
 is specifically designed to extract capsaicin from chili peppers. It doesn’t work for allyl\
 (line 60) isothiocyanate, or for anything else.\
 Pepper pungencies are also compared by using chromatography. Chromatography is an\
 analytical technique that separates the chemical components of a mixture. After\
 separation, the amounts of each component are quantified. Chromatography can\
 determine how much capsaicin is in a pepper. It can also determine how much allyl\
 (line 65) isothiocyanate is in wasabi. If two chili peppers have the same amount of capsaicin, it can\
 be assumed that those peppers are equally “hot.’’ But the same assumption cannot be made\
 when comparing chili peppers to wasabi. There’s no way to know if equal amounts of\
 capsaicin and allyl isothiocyanate cause equal degrees of pain. So chromatography cannot\
 definitively judge this contest.\
 (line 70) It isn’t even possible to directly measure and compare nerve responses, since\
 two different types of pain receptors are involved. Wasabi and chili peppers are like\
 pungent apples and oranges. There’s no objective way to declare one more potent than the\
 other. This friendly competition won’t be settled anytime soon. Everyone is free to chime\
 in with an opinion. You just have to try both of these pungent powerhouses, then root for\
 (line 75) your own favorite flavor of pain.\
What is the result of being unable to use the Scoville scale to measure the heat strength of wasabi?\
(A) Chromatography is used to compare the heat strengths of wasabi and chili peppers.\
 (B) Comparing the heat strengths of wasabi and chili peppers using a scientific method is impossible.\
 (C) A new scale will be developed to compare the degree of pain caused by wasabi and chili peppers.\
 (D) Experts now rely on a scale based on measuring consumer pain responses to wasabi and chili peppers.\

Base your answer to question 23 on the passage below and on your knowledge of social studies.\
 \
 . . . With growing unrest at home over the loss of Soviet soldiers in Afghanistan and the inability of the society to wage a foreign war and provide the essentials of life to its own citizens, the USSR was forced to retreat in ignominious [humiliating] defeat in February 1989—fewer than ten years after its invasion. This proved to be the final straw on the Soviet camel’s back. By the end of the same year, the Berlin Wall was down, and the Warsaw Pact was dead. Within two years, the Soviet Union was history. . .\

 Based on this passage, which long-term impact did the invasion of Afghanistan have on the Soviet Union?\
(1) It increased the Soviet Union’s ability to provide for their own people.\
 (2) It helped to bring about the collapse of the Soviet Union.\
 (3) It encouraged the Soviets to wage foreign wars and expand their empire.\
 (4) It allowed the Soviets to remove themselves from the Warsaw Pact.\

. . . In the Moghul [Mughal] empire the core contradiction had always been Hindus versus Muslims. Akbar the Great had worked out a sort of accommodation, but his great-grandson Aurangzeb reversed all his policies, enforcing orthodox Islam rigidly, restoring discrimination against Hindus, squashing smaller religious groups such as the Sikhs, and generally replacing tolerance with repression. And yet, say what you will about the man’s narrow-minded zealotry [fanaticism], Aurangzeb was a titanic talent, so he not only held his empire together but extended it. The whole time, however, he was sowing the discord [division] and tension that would erupt to ruin the empire as soon as a less capable ruler took charge. . . .\
 \
 . . . This glimpse into the Ottoman social clockwork does not begin to exhaust its fractal intricacy [complexity]: look closer and deeper into Ottoman society and you’ll see the same order of complexity at every level. Everything was connected to everything else and connected in many ways, which was fine when all the connections balanced out and all of the parts were working. Centuries later, when the empire entered its decrepitude [decaying state], all the intertwining parts and intermeshing [connecting] institutions became a peculiarly Ottoman liability; their intricacy meant that trouble in one place or sphere translated mysteriously to trouble in a dozen other places or spheres—but that came later. In the sixteenth century, the Ottoman Empire was an awesomely well-functioning machine. . . .\

Which statement best explains a reason the Mughal Empire declined and a reason the Ottoman Empire declined?\
(1) Mughal leaders were ineffective; Ottoman society was too interconnected.\
 (2) Mughal society was too secular; policies of Ottoman sultans were inconsistent.\
 (3) Religious diversity in the Mughal Empire was lacking; the Ottoman Empire never worked efficiently.\
 (4) Mughal society paid little attention to the government; Ottoman social groups were too isolated.\

Clash of the Condiments: Wasabi vs. the Chili Pepper\
 by Mary Beth Cox\
 \
 Most condiments are peaceable enough. The sauces, spreads, and pickles of the world\
 add flavor to our foods without kicking up much of a fuss. This is not true of the pungent\
 or “hot’’ condiments. They are more aggressive. They get our attention by purposely\
 causing us pain. These strong-armed seasonings are often the source of friendly\
 (line 5) competitions. Loyal fans will contend that their favorite pungent condiment is the one that\
 packs the most powerful punch. Ladies and gentlemen, you are cordially welcomed to just\
 such a contest. Here it is, the Match of the Moment: Wasabi vs. the Chili Pepper.\
 IN YOUR CORNERS\
 Introducing in the Green Corner, hailing from the island nation of Japan, sushi’s\
 inseparable sidekick: Wasabi! Wasabia japonica grows wild on the cool, damp banks of\
 (line 10) Japan’s many mountain streams. The chill of its habitat is quite ironic since wasabi is\
 famous for bringing the heat. The plant is a botanical relative of mustard and horseradish.\
 Pungency runs in the family. Traditionally, wasabi is prepared by grating its rootstock on\
 the abrasive skin of an angel shark. Authentic wasabi is relatively rare and difficult to\
 come by. The emerald condiment that is served outside of Japan is almost always\
 (line 15) horseradish pulp dyed with green food coloring. Whether the wasabi is real or whether it’s\
 the more common substitute, a whopping snootful will make you cry for your momma!\
 And in the red corner, originating from the Central and South Americas, now an\
 international culinary superstar: the Chili Pepper. Chili peppers are fruits of the plants of\
 the botanical genus Capsicum. They are related to the tomato and the eggplant. They’re\
 (line 20) the renegades in an otherwise mild-mannered botanical family. Chili peppers include but\
 are not limited to the poblano, the cayenne, the jalapeño, the tabasco, the habanero, and\
 the serrano. One of these culprits sometimes goes by the alias “chipotle.’’ A chipotle\
 (pronounced chee-POHT-lay) is none other than a dried smoked jalape ño. Chilies were\
 introduced to the non-American world by Christopher Columbus, who mistakenly\
 (line 25) identified them as variants of black pepper. Chilies have since taken the culinary world by\
 storm. They appear alongside dishes served around the globe, from the Basque provinces\
 to North Africa and the Middle East, to India and Southeast Asia. A potent chili pepper in\
 the kisser will make you rue the day you were born!\
 POWERFUL PUNCHES\
 Both wasabi and chilies are condiments of world-class pungency. But how do they\
 (line 30) match up head to head? Each has its own unique tactical move. Each has its own special\
 point of attack. The active ingredient of the wasabi plant is stored stealthily in its cells.\
 Under normal growing conditions, this ingredient is completely harmless. It’s not until the\
 plant’s cells are ruptured (as by the grating action of angel shark skin) that the trouble\
 begins. Enzymes convert the ingredient into molecules of allyl isothiocyanate. It’s the\
 (line 35) chemical characteristics of these irritating molecules that are the secret to wasabi’s\
 pungency. Allyl isothiocyanate molecules are lightweight. They are volatile. They are also\
 soluble in water. As a consequence, the consumption of wasabi launches an airborne\
 assault on the consumer’s sinuses. Allyl isothiocyanate molecules waft up the nose and\
 back of the throat. They dissolve in the watery fluids they find there. They intercept nerve\
 (line 40) endings in the nasal passages. Specifically, these molecules target pain receptors of the\
 type known as TRPA I . TRPA I receptors respond to the attack by sending emergency\
 signals to the brain: “Yikes . . . we’ve gotten hold of something painfully hot!’’\
 Chili peppers conduct operations of a different sort. Their active ingredient is a\
 substance called capsaicin. It’s found in the spongy inner tissue of peppers, but it can leak\
 (line 45) onto the seeds and inner wall of the fruit. Capsaicin molecules are heavier than the\
 molecules of wasabi’s allyl isothiocyanate. They are not volatile. They prefer to dissolve in\
 oils, so they aren’t as easily dissolved in water. Capsaicin molecules instigate an incendiary\
 assault upon contact with exposed vulnerable surfaces. They cling to the tender tissues of\
 the lips, mouth, and throat. They burn eyes that are rubbed with capsaicin-laced fingers.\
 (line 50) Capsaicin molecules interact with pain receptors of the type TRPV I. Again an alert is\
 expedited to the brain: “Mayday! Mayday! Let’s not eat any more of that, please!’’\
 WHERE’S THE REFEREE?\
 So which of these condiments causes the most pain? To settle any contest, a scoring\
 system is required. There is a way to compare the relative heat intensities of the various\
 chili peppers. It’s called the Scoville scale. Scoville ratings are determined by brave human\
 (line 55) test subjects who willingly sip extracts of chili pepper juice. Extracted juices are diluted\
 again and again until their heat can no longer be detected. A high rating on the Scoville\
 scale means that a lot of dilutions are necessary to eliminate the pain caused by a\
 particular pepper. Unfortunately, Scoville ratings are not applicable to wasabi. The method\
 is specifically designed to extract capsaicin from chili peppers. It doesn’t work for allyl\
 (line 60) isothiocyanate, or for anything else.\
 Pepper pungencies are also compared by using chromatography. Chromatography is an\
 analytical technique that separates the chemical components of a mixture. After\
 separation, the amounts of each component are quantified. Chromatography can\
 determine how much capsaicin is in a pepper. It can also determine how much allyl\
 (line 65) isothiocyanate is in wasabi. If two chili peppers have the same amount of capsaicin, it can\
 be assumed that those peppers are equally “hot.’’ But the same assumption cannot be made\
 when comparing chili peppers to wasabi. There’s no way to know if equal amounts of\
 capsaicin and allyl isothiocyanate cause equal degrees of pain. So chromatography cannot\
 definitively judge this contest.\
 (line 70) It isn’t even possible to directly measure and compare nerve responses, since\
 two different types of pain receptors are involved. Wasabi and chili peppers are like\
 pungent apples and oranges. There’s no objective way to declare one more potent than the\
 other. This friendly competition won’t be settled anytime soon. Everyone is free to chime\
 in with an opinion. You just have to try both of these pungent powerhouses, then root for\
 (line 75) your own favorite flavor of pain.\
Read this sentence from lines 71 and 72 of the article.\
 Wasabi and chili peppers are like pungent apples and oranges.\

(A) “They get our attention by purposely causing us pain.” (lines 3 and 4)\

 This is the true story of a Kenyan woman named Wangari Maathai.\
 Excerpt from Seeds of Change:\
 Planting a Path to Peace\
 by Jen Cullerton Johnson\
 \
 (paragraph 1) “Come,” Wangari’s mother called. She beckoned her young daughter over to a tall tree with a wide, smooth trunk and a crown of green, oval leaves.\
 \
 (paragraph 2) “Feel,” her mother whispered.\
 \
 (paragraph 3) Wangari spread her small hands over the tree’s trunk. She smoothed her fingers over the rough bark.\
 \
 (paragraph 4) “This is the mugumo,” her mother said. “It is home to many. It feeds many too.”\
 \
 (paragraph 5) She snapped off a wild fig from a low branch, and gave it to her daughter. Wangari ate the delicious fruit, just as geckos and elephants did. High in the tree, birds chirped in their nests. The branches bounced with jumping monkeys.\
 \
 (paragraph 6) “Our people, the Kikuyu of Kenya, believe that our ancestors rest in the tree’s shade,” her mother explained.\
 \
 (paragraph 7) Wangari wrapped her arms around the trunk as if hugging her great-grandmother’s spirit. She promised never to cut down the tree. . . .\
 \
 ((paragraph 8) When Wangari finished elementary school, she was eleven years old. Her mind was like a seed rooted in rich soil, ready to grow. Wangari wanted to continue her education, but to do so she would have to leave her village and move to the capital city of Nairobi. Wangari had never been farther than her valley’s ridge. She was scared.\
 \
 (paragraph 9) “Go,” her mother said. She picked up a handful of earth and placed it gently into her daughter’s hand. “Where you go, we go.” . . .\
 \
 (paragraph 10) As graduation neared, Wangari told her friends she wanted to become a biologist.\
 \
 (paragraph 11) “Not many native women become biologists,” they told her.\
 \
 (paragraph 12) “I will,” she said.\
 \
 (paragraph 13) Wangari watched sadly as her government sold more and more land to big companies that cut down forests for timber and to clear land for coffee plantations. Native trees such as cedar and acacia vanished. Without trees, birds had no place to nest. Monkeys lost their swings. Tired mothers walked miles for firewood. . . .\
 \
 (paragraph 14) When Wangari visited her village she saw that the Kikuyu custom of not chopping down the mugumo trees had been lost. No longer held in place by tree roots, the soil streamed into the rivers. The water that had been used to grow maize, bananas, and sweet potatoes turned to mud and dried up. Many families went hungry.\
 \
 (paragraph 15) Wangari could not bear to think of the land being destroyed. Now married and the mother of three children, she worried about what would happen to the mothers and children who depended on the land.\
 \
 (paragraph 16) “We must do something,” Wangari said.\
 \
 (paragraph 17) Wangari had an idea as small as a seed but as tall as a tree that reaches for the sky. “Harabee! Let’s work together!” she said to her countrywomen—mothers like her. Wangari dug deep into the soil, a seedling by her side. “We must plant trees.” . . .\
 \
 (paragraph 18) Wangari traveled to villages, towns, and cities with saplings and seeds, shovels and hoes. At each place she went, women planted rows of trees that looked like green belts across the land. Because of this they started calling themselves the Green Belt Movement.\
 \
 (paragraph 19) “We might not change the big world but we can change the landscape of the forest,” she said.\
 \
 (paragraph 20) One tree turned to ten, ten to one hundred, one hundred to one million, all the way up to thirty million planted trees. Kenya grew green again. Birds nested in new trees. Monkeys swung on branches. Rivers filled with clean water. Wild figs grew heavy in mugumo branches.\
 \
 (paragraph 21) Mothers fed their children maize, bananas, and sweet potatoes until they could eat no more.\
Paragraphs 17 and 18 explain that Wangari spread her idea by\
(A) sharing it with women around the coun\
 (B) giving it the name Green Belt Movement\
 (C) watching the land in Kenya turn green again\
 (D) planting trees herself everywhere she went\

Reading Comprehension Passage C\
 \
 Get That Song Outta My Head!\
 \
    The nightmare began when my husband walked into our kitchen and said, “I’ve had this\
 song stuck in my head all day …”\
    No! I thought. Don’t say it!\
    “Remember that song from the original Karate Kid movie?” he continued.\
 (line 5)   For the love of God, no!\
    “You know how it goes. ‘You’re the best around … na na na na na, na na na na. You’re\
 the best around …”\
    It was too late. Now I had an earworm — a song, melody or jingle that gets stuck in your\
 head.\
 (line 10)   The worst part? I only knew that same line. I walked around humming it for days. I tried\
 to shake it by singing along with tunes playing on my car radio while I was out running\
 errands. For a brief time, Van Halen’s “Runnin’ With the Devil” replaced it.\
    But in no time at all, that one line from “You’re the Best,” sung by Joe Esposito on the\
 The Karate Kid soundtrack, was back.\
 (line 15)   Perhaps if I heard more of the song in my head, it wouldn’t be as annoying. But just this\
 one line? Over and over and over again? It was pure torture. I needed to do something\
 drastic. I busted out that 1980s hit, “The Safety Dance” by Men Without Hats. After singing\
 it a few times, the earworm was gone.\
    I knew I’d get another one, though. About 90 percent of people experience earworms\
 (line 20) at least once a week, according to the Earworm Project run by the Music, Mind and Brain\
 group at Goldsmiths, University of London.\
    “Music lovers, specifically people who ascribe (ascribe - credit) more importance to music or people\
 who spend more time listening to music, have more frequent and longer earworm\
 episodes,” says Kelly Jakubowski, a researcher with the Earworm Project. …\
 (line 25)   To find out what causes earworms and how to get rid of them, I contacted the man\
 known as “Dr. Earworm,” James Kellaris, a marketing professor at the University of\
 Cincinnati. Certainly with a nickname like that, he would know something.\
    Kellaris began studying earworms in 1999. A former professional musician prone to\
 getting earworms himself, he eventually became a marketing professor “interested in how\
 (line 30) marketers use music to achieve various commercial goals,” he says. “It was a perfect storm\
 to create an earworms researcher.”\
    He explained to me that when we get an earworm, the tune seems to repeat itself\
 involuntarily, which is why experts consider earworms involuntary musical imagery (INMI).\
 This was exactly what “You’re the Best” had done to me.\
 (line 35)   So what, precisely, was happening in my brain when I couldn’t shake that tune?\
 Jakubowski contributed to a May 2015 study led by Nicolas Farrugia, a postdoctoral\
 researcher with the Earworm Project, that demonstrated auditory and inhibitory-related\
 areas play a role in earworms as well.\
    The researchers examined 44 healthy subjects, all between 25 and 70 years old and all\
 (line 40) participants of a past neuroimaging study run by the Cambridge Medical Research\
 Council’s Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit. These subjects took an online survey that\
 measured both the extent of their musical training and how strongly INMIs impacted them.\
 For example, the survey wanted to know how strong of a negative impact INMIs had on\
 them or if INMIs were actually helpful while they went about their everyday activities.\
 (line 45)   When they examined these participants’ brain images, one pattern in particular stuck\
 out: People who got earworms more often had a thinner right frontal cortex, which is\
 involved in inhibition, (inhibition -restraining behavior) and a thinner temporal cortex, which processes sensory stimuli like\
 sound. In other words, these people’s brains just weren’t as good at suppressing the random\
 song that might pop into their heads.\
 (line 50)   Why we get earworms, unfortunately, remains a scientific mystery. “We know that songs\
 that are ‘catchy’ — short, simple, repetitive and contain some incongruity — are most likely\
 to get stuck,” Kellaris says. Most people are more likely to get a song like “Don’t Worry, Be\
 Happy” stuck in their heads than, say, a Mahler symphony. And some things exacerbate\
 them: frequency and duration of exposure to music, worry, stress, fatigue and idleness.\
 (line 55)   Considering that my husband kept singing the snippet (snippet - short piece) while I was tired and stressed,\
 I can see why it got stuck. But my earworms have been relatively innocuous. (innocuous - harmless) Even though\
 they’re annoying, I can eventually get rid of them. Some people can’t, though.\
    Part of Kellaris’ earliest research involved mailing a questionnaire to about 1,000\
 respondents at four U.S. universities. He asked them if they’d ever had an earworm, for how\
 (line 60) long, how often it happened, how it made them feel, etc.\
    One respondent claimed to have had a song stuck in his head since 1978. This is known\
 as intrusive musical imagery (IMI), a musical obsession that’s chronic and highly distracting\
 to a person’s everyday life and work. According to Dean McKay, a psychology professor at\
 Fordham University, my short-lived earworm was nothing compared to an IMI.\
 (line 65)   But now I was concerned. Could my future earworms turn into these IMIs? Is there a\
 way to prevent this from happening?\
    McKay co-authored a June 2014 study titled “Musical obsessions: A comprehensive\
 review of neglected clinical phenomena.” For this study, McKay and other international\
 colleagues, all of whom treat obsessive-compulsive disorder, created the first\
 (line 70) comprehensive review of musical obsessions. They compiled a database of 96 case study\
 descriptions of people with severe musical obsessions — the largest compilation (compilation - collection) assembled\
 on this topic. They determined the characteristics of musical obsessions such as IMIs and\
 compared them with earworms, musical hallucinations and visual obsessional imagery.\
    The group’s research showed that IMIs can be treated by using a method known as\
 (line 75) distraction — coming up with a competing melody to think about that would get rid of the\
 IMI. That’s exactly what I had done, albeit unknowingly, when I used “The Safety Dance”\
 to stop my earworm.\
    McKay says my earworm was pesky because I knew only that one part of the song. He\
 suggests if I have just a portion of a song looping in my brain in the future, I can try another\
 (line 80) method called exposure — simply listening to the entire song. “It’s like a completion task,”\
 he says. “Once you know the whole song, then there’s no need for it to be stuck in your\
 head.”\
    Another form of distraction is to sing the song out loud, but change some of the words\
 or slightly throw off the melody. One of McKay’s patients had an IMI based on a Taylor\
 (line 85) Swift song. “We made up some other words for it,” he explains. “We messed up the melody\
 a bit, but not so much that it wasn’t recognizable as still being that song, and then it faded.”\
 McKay stresses that this is the only case he’s tried this in, so it’s not a forgone conclusion\
 this kind of distraction would work in other instances.\
    What I wanted to know was if the earworm I get today could become the IMI of\
 (line 90) tomorrow.\
    “Highly improbable,” he says.\
    “You’re the best,” I reply.\
    Oh no.\

In this excerpt, the author talks about introducing her chickens to her yard.\
 \
 Excerpt from Birdology\
 by Sy Montgomery\
 \
 At first I was afraid they’d run away or become lost. We had a cozy, secure home for\
 them prepared in the bottom storey of our barn, with wood shavings scattered over the\
 dirt floor, a dispenser for fresh water, a trough for chick feed, some low perches made\
 from dowels, and a hay-lined nest box made from an old rabbit hutch left over from one\
 (line 5) of the barn’s previous denizens, in which they could lay future eggs. Chickens need to be\
 closed in safe at night to protect them from predators, but by day we didn’t want to\
 confine them; we wanted to give them free run of the yard. But how could they possibly\
 understand that they lived here now? Once we let them out, would they even recognize\
 their space in the barn and go back in it? When I was in seventh grade, my family had\
 (line 10) moved, once again, to a new house; my first afternoon there I literally got lost in my own\
 backyard. Could these six-week-old chicks be expected to know better?\
 Gretchen assured me there would be no problem. “Leave them in the pen for\
 twenty-four hours,” she told me. “Then you can let them out and they’ll stick around.\
 They’ll go back in again when it starts to get dark.”\
 (line 15) “But how do they know?” I asked.\
 “They just do,” she said. “Chickens just know these things.”\
 When before dusk, I found them all perched calmly back in their coop, I saw that\
 Gretchen was right.\
 In fact, chickens know many things, some from the moment they are born. Like all\
 (line 20) members of the order in which they are classified, the Galliformes, or game birds,\
 just-hatched baby chickens are astonishingly mature and mobile, able to walk, peck, and\
 run only hours after leaving the egg.\
 This developmental strategy is called precocial. Like its opposite, the altricial strategy\
 (employed by creatures such as humans and songbirds, who are born naked and helpless),\
 (line 25) the precocial strategy was sculpted by eons of adaptation to food and predators. If your\
 nest is on the ground, as most game birds’ are, it’s a good idea to get your babies out of\
 there as quickly as possible before someone comes to eat them. So newborn game birds\
 hatch covered in down, eyes open, and leave the nest within twenty-four hours. (An\
 Australian game bird known as the malleefowl begins its life by digging its way out of\
 (line 30) its nest of decaying vegetation and walks off into the bush without ever even meeting\
 either parent.)\
 That chickens hatch from the egg knowing how to walk, run, peck, and scratch has an\
 odd consequence: many people take this as further evidence they are stupid. But instinct is\
 not stupidity. (After all, Einstein was born knowing how to suckle.) Nor does instinct\
 (line 35) preclude learning. Unlike my disoriented seventh-grade self (and I have not improved\
 much since), young chickens have a great capacity for spatial learning. In scientific\
 experiments, researchers have trained days-old chicks to find hidden food using both\
 distant and nearby landmarks as cues. Italian researchers demonstrated that at the tender\
 age of fifteen days, after just a week’s training to find hidden food in the middle of their\
 (line 40) cage, chicks can correctly calculate the center of a given environment—even in the\
 absence of distinctive landmarks. Even more astonishing, they can do it in spaces they\
 have never seen before, whether the area be circular, square, or triangular. How? The\
 chicks “probably relied on a visual estimate of these distances from their actual positions,”\
 wrote University of Padova researcher L. Tommasi and co-authors in the Journal of\
 (line 45) Comparative Physiology, ”. . . [but] it remains to be determined how the chicks actually\
 measure distances in the task.”\
 We never determined how our first chickens knew their new home was theirs, either.\
 We never knew how they managed to discern the boundaries of our property. But they\
 did. At first, they liked to stay near the coop. But as they grew, they took to following me\
 (line 50) everywhere, first cheeping like the tinkling of little bells, later clucking in animated adult\
 discussion. If I was hanging out the laundry, they would check what was in the laundry\
 basket. If I was weeding a flower bed, they would join me, raking the soil with their\
 strong, scaly feet, then stepping backward to see what was revealed. (Whenever I worked\
 with soil, I suspect they assumed I was digging for worms.) When my husband, Howard,\
 (line 55) and I would eat at the picnic table under the big silver maple, the Ladies would\
 accompany us. When my father-in-law came to help my husband build a pen for\
 Christopher Hogwood, then still a piglet, the Ladies milled underfoot to supervise every\
 move. The hens were clearly interested in the project, pecking at the shiny nails, standing\
 tall to better observe the use of tools, clucking a running commentary all the while. Before\
 (line 60) this experience, Howard’s dad would have been the first to say that he didn’t think\
 chickens were that smart. But they changed his mind. After a few hours I noticed he\
 began to address them. Picking up a hammer they were examining, he might say, directly\
 and respectfully, “Pardon me, Ladies”—as if he were speaking to my mother-in-law and\
 me when we got in the way.\
 (line 65) But when their human friends are inside, and this is much of the time, the Ladies\
 explore on their own. A chicken can move as fast as nine miles an hour, which can take\
 you pretty far, and ours are free to go anywhere they like. But ours have intuited our\
 property lines and confine their travels to its boundaries. They have never crossed the\
 street. And for years, they never hopped across the low stone wall separating our land\
 (line 70) from that of our closest neighbor. That came later—and it was not the result of any\
 physical change in the landscape, but the outcome of a change in social relationships\
 among their human friends.\
Lines 1 through 11 best support the idea that the author\
(A) is fearful the chicks will be vulnerable to predators\
 (B) is unsure about what she can expect the chicks to understand\
 (C) wants the chicks to explore the yard she has set up for their needs\
 (D) has not planned how she will teach the chicks to adjust to a new environment\

Reading Comprehension Passage C\
 \
 Get That Song Outta My Head!\
 \
    The nightmare began when my husband walked into our kitchen and said, “I’ve had this\
 song stuck in my head all day …”\
    No! I thought. Don’t say it!\
    “Remember that song from the original Karate Kid movie?” he continued.\
 (line 5)   For the love of God, no!\
    “You know how it goes. ‘You’re the best around … na na na na na, na na na na. You’re\
 the best around …”\
    It was too late. Now I had an earworm — a song, melody or jingle that gets stuck in your\
 head.\
 (line 10)   The worst part? I only knew that same line. I walked around humming it for days. I tried\
 to shake it by singing along with tunes playing on my car radio while I was out running\
 errands. For a brief time, Van Halen’s “Runnin’ With the Devil” replaced it.\
    But in no time at all, that one line from “You’re the Best,” sung by Joe Esposito on the\
 The Karate Kid soundtrack, was back.\
 (line 15)   Perhaps if I heard more of the song in my head, it wouldn’t be as annoying. But just this\
 one line? Over and over and over again? It was pure torture. I needed to do something\
 drastic. I busted out that 1980s hit, “The Safety Dance” by Men Without Hats. After singing\
 it a few times, the earworm was gone.\
    I knew I’d get another one, though. About 90 percent of people experience earworms\
 (line 20) at least once a week, according to the Earworm Project run by the Music, Mind and Brain\
 group at Goldsmiths, University of London.\
    “Music lovers, specifically people who ascribe (ascribe - credit) more importance to music or people\
 who spend more time listening to music, have more frequent and longer earworm\
 episodes,” says Kelly Jakubowski, a researcher with the Earworm Project. …\
 (line 25)   To find out what causes earworms and how to get rid of them, I contacted the man\
 known as “Dr. Earworm,” James Kellaris, a marketing professor at the University of\
 Cincinnati. Certainly with a nickname like that, he would know something.\
    Kellaris began studying earworms in 1999. A former professional musician prone to\
 getting earworms himself, he eventually became a marketing professor “interested in how\
 (line 30) marketers use music to achieve various commercial goals,” he says. “It was a perfect storm\
 to create an earworms researcher.”\
    He explained to me that when we get an earworm, the tune seems to repeat itself\
 involuntarily, which is why experts consider earworms involuntary musical imagery (INMI).\
 This was exactly what “You’re the Best” had done to me.\
 (line 35)   So what, precisely, was happening in my brain when I couldn’t shake that tune?\
 Jakubowski contributed to a May 2015 study led by Nicolas Farrugia, a postdoctoral\
 researcher with the Earworm Project, that demonstrated auditory and inhibitory-related\
 areas play a role in earworms as well.\
    The researchers examined 44 healthy subjects, all between 25 and 70 years old and all\
 (line 40) participants of a past neuroimaging study run by the Cambridge Medical Research\
 Council’s Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit. These subjects took an online survey that\
 measured both the extent of their musical training and how strongly INMIs impacted them.\
 For example, the survey wanted to know how strong of a negative impact INMIs had on\
 them or if INMIs were actually helpful while they went about their everyday activities.\
 (line 45)   When they examined these participants’ brain images, one pattern in particular stuck\
 out: People who got earworms more often had a thinner right frontal cortex, which is\
 involved in inhibition, (inhibition -restraining behavior) and a thinner temporal cortex, which processes sensory stimuli like\
 sound. In other words, these people’s brains just weren’t as good at suppressing the random\
 song that might pop into their heads.\
 (line 50)   Why we get earworms, unfortunately, remains a scientific mystery. “We know that songs\
 that are ‘catchy’ — short, simple, repetitive and contain some incongruity — are most likely\
 to get stuck,” Kellaris says. Most people are more likely to get a song like “Don’t Worry, Be\
 Happy” stuck in their heads than, say, a Mahler symphony. And some things exacerbate\
 them: frequency and duration of exposure to music, worry, stress, fatigue and idleness.\
 (line 55)   Considering that my husband kept singing the snippet (snippet - short piece) while I was tired and stressed,\
 I can see why it got stuck. But my earworms have been relatively innocuous. (innocuous - harmless) Even though\
 they’re annoying, I can eventually get rid of them. Some people can’t, though.\
    Part of Kellaris’ earliest research involved mailing a questionnaire to about 1,000\
 respondents at four U.S. universities. He asked them if they’d ever had an earworm, for how\
 (line 60) long, how often it happened, how it made them feel, etc.\
    One respondent claimed to have had a song stuck in his head since 1978. This is known\
 as intrusive musical imagery (IMI), a musical obsession that’s chronic and highly distracting\
 to a person’s everyday life and work. According to Dean McKay, a psychology professor at\
 Fordham University, my short-lived earworm was nothing compared to an IMI.\
 (line 65)   But now I was concerned. Could my future earworms turn into these IMIs? Is there a\
 way to prevent this from happening?\
    McKay co-authored a June 2014 study titled “Musical obsessions: A comprehensive\
 review of neglected clinical phenomena.” For this study, McKay and other international\
 colleagues, all of whom treat obsessive-compulsive disorder, created the first\
 (line 70) comprehensive review of musical obsessions. They compiled a database of 96 case study\
 descriptions of people with severe musical obsessions — the largest compilation (compilation - collection) assembled\
 on this topic. They determined the characteristics of musical obsessions such as IMIs and\
 compared them with earworms, musical hallucinations and visual obsessional imagery.\
    The group’s research showed that IMIs can be treated by using a method known as\
 (line 75) distraction — coming up with a competing melody to think about that would get rid of the\
 IMI. That’s exactly what I had done, albeit unknowingly, when I used “The Safety Dance”\
 to stop my earworm.\
    McKay says my earworm was pesky because I knew only that one part of the song. He\
 suggests if I have just a portion of a song looping in my brain in the future, I can try another\
 (line 80) method called exposure — simply listening to the entire song. “It’s like a completion task,”\
 he says. “Once you know the whole song, then there’s no need for it to be stuck in your\
 head.”\
    Another form of distraction is to sing the song out loud, but change some of the words\
 or slightly throw off the melody. One of McKay’s patients had an IMI based on a Taylor\
 (line 85) Swift song. “We made up some other words for it,” he explains. “We messed up the melody\
 a bit, but not so much that it wasn’t recognizable as still being that song, and then it faded.”\
 McKay stresses that this is the only case he’s tried this in, so it’s not a forgone conclusion\
 this kind of distraction would work in other instances.\
    What I wanted to know was if the earworm I get today could become the IMI of\
 (line 90) tomorrow.\
    “Highly improbable,” he says.\
    “You’re the best,” I reply.\
    Oh no.\

 Reading Comprehension Passage A\
 \
 The Count and the Wedding Guest\
 \
    Miss Maggie Conway and Mr. Andy Donovan are staying at the same boarding house in New York City.\
 \
    …Just coming out the door was Miss Conway. She wore a night-black dress of\
 crêpe de—crêpe de—oh, this thin black goods.(goods - fabric) Her hat was black, and from it drooped and\
 fluttered an ebon veil, filmy as a spider’s web. She stood on the top step and drew on black\
 silk gloves. Not a speck of white or a spot of color about her dress anywhere. Her rich\
 (line 5) golden hair was drawn, with scarcely a ripple, into a shining, smooth knot low on her neck.\
 Her face was plain rather than pretty, but it was now illuminated and made almost beautiful\
 by her large gray eyes that gazed above the houses across the street into the sky with an\
 expression of the most appealing sadness and melancholy. …\
    “It’s a fine, clear evening, Miss Conway,” he [Andy Donovan] said; and if the Weather\
 (line 10) Bureau could have heard the confident emphasis of his tones it would have hoisted the\
 square white signal, (square white signal - a sign of good weather) and nailed it to the mast.\
    “To them that has the heart to enjoy it, it is, Mr. Donovan,” said Miss Conway, with\
 a sigh. …\
    “I hope none of your relatives—I hope you haven’t sustained a loss?” ventured\
 (line 15) Mr. Donovan.\
    “Death has claimed,” said Miss Conway, hesitating—“not a relative, but one who—but\
 I will not intrude my grief upon you, Mr. Donovan.”\
    “Intrude?” protested Mr. Donovan. “Why, say, Miss Conway, I’d be delighted, that is,\
 I’d be sorry—I mean I’m sure nobody could sympathize with you truer than I would.”\
 (line 20)   Miss Conway smiled a little smile. And oh, it was sadder than her expression in repose. (repose - at rest) …\
    “It’s tough to be alone in New York—that’s a cinch,” said Mr. Donovan. “But, say—\
 whenever this little old town does loosen up and get friendly it goes the limit. Say you took\
 a little stroll in the park, Miss Conway—don’t you think it might chase away some of your\
 mullygrubs? And if you’d allow me—”\
 (line 25)   “Thanks, Mr. Donovan. I’d be pleased to accept of your escort if you think the company\
 of one whose heart is filled with gloom could be anyways agreeable to you.”\
    Through the open gates of the iron-railed, old, downtown park, where the elect once\
 took the air, they strolled, and found a quiet bench. …\
    “He was my fiancé,” confided Miss Conway, at the end of an hour. “We were going to\
 (line 30) be married next spring. I don’t want you to think that I am stringing you, Mr. Donovan, but\
 he was a real Count. He had an estate and a castle in Italy. Count Fernando Mazzini was\
 his name. I never saw the beat of him for elegance. Papa objected, of course, and once \
 we eloped, but papa overtook us, and took us back. I thought sure papa and Fernando \
 would fight a duel. Papa has a livery business—in P’kipsee [Poughkeepsie], you know.” … \
 (line 35)    “Three days ago I got a letter from Italy, forwarded from P’kipsee, saying that Fernando \
 had been killed in a gondola accident.” … \
    “I’ve got his picture here in my locket,” said Miss Conway, after wiping her eyes with \
 her handkerchief. “I never showed it to anybody; but I will to you, Mr. Donovan, because \
 I believe you to be a true friend.” \
 (line 40)   Mr. Donovan gazed long and with much interest at the photograph in the locket that \
 Miss Conway opened for him. The face of Count Mazzini was one to command interest. \
 It was a smooth, intelligent, bright, almost a handsome face—the face of a strong, cheerful \
 man who might well be a leader among his fellows. \
    “I have a larger one, framed, in my room,” said Miss Conway. “When we return I will\
 (line 45) show you that. They are all I have to remind me of Fernando. But he ever will be present \
 in my heart, that’s a sure thing.” \
    A subtle task confronted Mr. Donovan,—that of supplanting (supplanting - replacing) the unfortunate Count in \
 the heart of Miss Conway. This his admiration for her determined him to do. But the \
 magnitude of the undertaking did not seem to weigh upon his spirits. The sympathetic but\
 (line 50) cheerful friend was the role he essayed; (essayed - attempted) and he played it so successfully that the next \
 half-hour found them conversing pensively across two plates of ice-cream, though yet there \
 was no diminution of the sadness in Miss Conway’s large gray eyes. \
    Before they parted in the hall that evening she ran upstairs and brought down the \
 framed photograph wrapped lovingly in a white silk scarf. Mr. Donovan surveyed it with\
 (line 55) inscrutable (inscrutable - unreadable) eyes. … \
    “A fine-looking man,” said Mr. Donovan, heartily. “How would it suit you, Miss Conway, \
 to give me the pleasure of your company to Coney [Island] next Sunday afternoon?” \
    A month later they announced their engagement to Mrs. Scott and the other boarders. \
 Miss Conway continued to wear black.\
 (line 60)   A week after the announcement the two sat on the same bench in the downtown park, \
 while the fluttering leaves of the trees made a dim kinetoscopic (kinetoscopic - flickering) picture of them in the \
 moonlight. But Donovan had worn a look of abstracted gloom all day. He was so silent \
 to-night that love’s lips could not keep back any longer the questions that love’s heart \
 propounded. (propounded - put forward)\
 (line 65)   “What’s the matter, Andy, you are so solemn and grouchy to-night?”\
    “Nothing, Maggie.”\
    “I know better. Can’t I tell? You never acted this way before. What is it?” … \
    “I’ll tell you then,” said Andy, wisely, “but I guess you won’t understand it exactly. \
 You’ve heard of Mike Sullivan, haven’t you? ‘Big Mike’ Sullivan, everybody calls him.”\
 (line 70)   “No, I haven’t,” said Maggie. “And I don’t want to, if he makes you act like this. Who is \
 he?” …\
    “Well, Big Mike’s a friend of mine. I ain’t more than deuce-high in the district as far as \
 influence goes, but Mike’s as good a friend to a little man, or a poor man as he is to a big \
 one. I met him to-day on the Bowery [Street], and what do you think he does? Comes up\
 (line 75) and shakes hands. ‘Andy,’ says he, ‘I’ve been keeping cases on you. You’ve been putting in \
 some good licks over on your side of the street, and I’m proud of you. What’ll you take to \
 drink?’ He takes a cigar, and I take a highball. I told him I was going to get married in two \
 weeks. ‘Andy,’ says he, ‘send me an invitation, so I’ll keep in mind of it, and I’ll come to the \
 wedding.’ That’s what Big Mike says to me; and he always does what he says. \
 (line 80)   “You don’t understand it, Maggie, but I’d have one of my hands cut off to have Big Mike \
 Sullivan at our wedding. It would be the proudest day of my life. When he goes to a man’s \
 wedding, there’s a guy being married that’s made for life. Now, that’s why I’m maybe looking \
 sore to-night.”\
    “Why don’t you invite him, then, if he’s so much to the mustard?” (to the mustard - successful) said Maggie, lightly. …\
 (line 85)   “Maggie,” said Andy, presently, “do you think as much of me as you did of your—as you \
 did of the Count Mazzini?”\
    He waited a long time, but Maggie did not reply. And then, suddenly she leaned against \
 his shoulder and began to cry—to cry and shake with sobs, holding his arm tightly, and \
 wetting the crêpe de Chine with tears. …\
 (line 90)   But instead of being pushed away, she found Andy’s arm folding her closer. She looked \
 up and saw his face cleared and smiling. …\
    “Andy,” said Maggie, with a somewhat shy smile, after she had been thoroughly assured \
 of forgiveness, “did you believe all that story about the Count?” \
    “Well, not to any large extent,” said Andy, reaching for his cigar case, “because it’s\
 (line 95) Big Mike Sullivan’s picture you’ve got in that locket of yours.” \

Dear fellow countrymen, compatriots. Due to the situation which has evolved as a result of the formation of the Commonwealth of Independent States, I hereby discontinue my activities at the post of President of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.\
 \
 I am making this decision on considerations of principle. I firmly came out in favor of the independence of nations and sovereignty for the republics. At the same time, I support the preservation of the union state and the integrity of this country.\
 \
 The developments took a different course. The policy prevailed of dismembering this country and disuniting the state, which is something I cannot subscribe to. . . .\

 Excerpt from The Woolly-Puff Rescue\
 \
 by Sue Mozena\
 \
 (paragraph 1) Wendy and Alex stared at the strange ﬂower at their feet. Dozens of them bloomed in this remote corner of the ﬁeld.\
 \
 (paragraph 2) Wendy bent down for a closer look. “We shouldn’t name them until we’re sure we can keep them,” she warned. “But I like Woolly-Puffs. They look just like ﬂeecy rainbows.”\
 \
 (paragraph 3) As tempting as it was to pet the feathery yellow-orange-red-purple-blue petals, neither of them did. Instead, Wendy pulled protective gloves from her belt pack.\
 \
 (paragraph 4) On the asteroid-based colony of New Harmony, even twelve-year-old pioneers knew the number one rule for living in outer space: don’t touch or taste or sniff anything that hasn’t been tested.\
 \
 (paragraph 5) “Where do you think they came from?” Wendy asked. With a gentle tug, she freed a Woolly-Puff from the thin layer of soil, sealed it in a clear bag.\
 \
 (paragraph 6) “They were probably in the compost shipment that brought these naggers,” Alex muttered. He slapped at one of the whining insects that swarmed around him looking for exposed skin to bite.\
 \
 compost = a mixture of decaying plants used to improve the soil in a garden\
 \
 (paragraph 7) New Harmony depended on shipments of rich compost from nearby planets to build up its soil. Usually the compost was treated before it arrived, but one shipment had been accidentally overlooked. The whining gnat-like insects the colonists called “naggers” had hatched from the compost. Without any natural enemies in this new world, the insects had multiplied, becoming a constant torment to the colonists.\
 \
 (paragraph 8) After turning in their discovery, Wendy settled on a stone bench in front of the New Harmony laboratory. Alex paced, then sat. “Poor Woolly-Puff,” Wendy said. “What if it’s just a weedy ﬂower?”\
 \
 (paragraph 9) “Then one living plant and a packet of seeds will be sent to the Botany Preserve on Mars,” Alex answered, rubbing a hot-pink nagger welt just above his elbow.\
 \
 (paragraph 10) Wendy gingerly held the extra bouquet she had picked, in case the Woolly-Puffs proved keepers. “And the rest of the plants—”\
 \
 (paragraph 11) “The rest will be pulled up and destroyed to make room for ‘useful’ plants,” Alex said.\
 \
 (paragraph 12) The colony of New Harmony did have ﬂowers. It just didn’t have a lot of room. Woolly-Puffs would have to be more than pretty if they wanted to grow here.\
 \
 (paragraph 13) The two friends scrambled to attention as the lab door opened.\
 \
 (paragraph 14) “Your Woolly-Puff isn’t toxic,” Professor Raglin said. His smile faded as he went on. “The sap is thick and sticky, but we already have a good glue. The stems are too woody and the leaves too bristly to eat. And the petals, well, they smell funny. Not ﬂowery at all. More like moldy lemons. I’m sorry, but I’ll have to make my report to the council this afternoon. The good news is that they seem to grow only in the soil where you found them, so it won’t be hard to get rid of them.”\
 \
 (paragraph 15) “At least they’re not poison,” Wendy said after Professor Raglin had left. She hugged her colorful, fuzzy bouquet. She had to admit they did smell funny. “Mayor Murphy will probably send a reclaim crew out after the council meeting.” She sighed. “I wish the council would let us adopt one, like a pet.”\
 \
 (paragraph 16) “Fat chance,” Alex said. He blew at a pair of naggers trying to land on his knee. “Shoo! For harmless gnats, these bugs sure are pests.”\
 \
 (paragraph 17) “Yeah.” Wendy reached up to scratch the end of her nose. Then she realized something. The end of her nose itched simply because that’s what the ends of noses do sometimes. The naggers weren’t biting her. They weren’t even landing on her.\
 \
 (paragraph 18) “We’re going to the council meeting,” she announced.\
 \
 (paragraph 19) That afternoon, when the council members emerged from the community center, Alex and Wendy were waiting.\
 \
 (paragraph 20) “What is the meaning of this?” Mayor Murphy demanded as Alex and Wendy presented each member of the council with a Woolly-Puff garland.\
 \
 (paragraph 21) Glancing at Alex for courage, Wendy said, “Woolly-Puffs are bug chasers.”\
 \
 (paragraph 22) “Sorry,” Mayor Murphy said ﬁrmly. “We have already made our decision.”\
 \
 (paragraph 23) “Just watch,” Wendy pleaded. “Watch the naggers.”\
 \
 (paragraph 24) Then someone said, “What naggers? I don’t see any.”\
 \
 (paragraph 25) “Where are the naggers?” asked Professor Raglin. “It’s as if they’re avoiding us.”\
 \
 (paragraph 26) Wendy smiled. “They are. Naggers don’t like Woolly-Puffs.”\
 \
 (paragraph 27) So the Woolly-Puffs stayed in the vases and ﬂower boxes and gardens of New Harmony because, of course, they weren’t just pretty. They smelled like moldy lemons. And luckily, naggers couldn’t stand the smell of moldy lemons.\
How does the setting of the story affect what happens to the Woolly-Puff?\
(A) A lack of space causes the ﬂower to be shipped away.\
 (B) A need for compost causes the plant to be valued.\
 (C) A problem with insects causes the ﬂower to be kept.\
 (D) A lack of pets causes the plant to be adopted.\

The First Public Park\
 by Marcia Amidon Lusted\
 \
 It was just an idea for more than a decade, but by 1857, New Yorkers were serious\
 about building a grand public park. New York was the largest metropolis in the nation,\
 and its citizens wanted to show the world that Americans were not just concerned about\
 industry, wealth, and materialism but that they also appreciated natural landscapes.\
 (line 5) Using eminent domain, the city took more than 840 acres of land in the center of\
 Manhattan for the new park. The area was considered to lack any real estate value—it\
 included swamps, bluffs, and rock outcroppings as well as two reservoirs that supplied city\
 water. It was home to about 1,600 poor residents, however. This population of pig farmers,\
 gardeners, and an African American settlement called Seneca Village was displaced by the\
 (line 10) park’s construction.\
 The Central Park Commission held a competition to choose someone to design the\
 park. Among the professional and amateur designers who entered the contest was a team\
 consisting of an American agriculturalist and a British-born architect: Frederick Law\
 Olmsted and Calvert Vaux.\
 (line 15) It was Vaux’s idea for the two men to join forces. A talented draftsman, Vaux used his\
 detailed drawings to show how their idea for the park would look. An accomplished\
 writer, Olmsted wrote the report that described their plan and included lists of proposed\
 plants and an estimated budget. They submitted their plan, called “Greensward,” a day\
 after the commission’s deadline.\
 (line 20) Greensward included pastoral views and rolling meadows, just like those in traditional\
 English parks. The plan offered beautiful vistas of green lawns and natural rocky ridges as\
 well as more formal locations for public gatherings.\
 It also included four roads that cut through the park to carry carriage traffic from one\
 side to the other. Olmsted and Vaux designed these major thoroughfares to run eight feet\
 (line 25) below the park’s surface so they would not disrupt the park’s views and rural feeling.\
 Pedestrian paths, equestrian roads, and carriage drives were all kept separate from one\
 another. Vaux designed more than 40 bridges so that these various paths would never have\
 to cross on the same level.\
 Unlike some of the other submissions that included grand, elaborate buildings,\
 (line 30) Olmsted and Vaux kept structures to a minimum, with only four in the original plan. The\
 design and materials for the buildings were also specifically selected to blend in with the\
 natural environment.\
 Greensward was announced the winner in the spring of 1858. The selection committee\
 debated over certain design points—some of the members wanted a wide grand avenue in\
 (line 35) the park, similar to those found in European parks. Olmsted argued against it by saying\
 that stately roads would “destroy scenery at great cost” and that “straight lines of trees or\
 stately architecture . . . belong not to parks for the people but to palatial gardens.” Olmsted\
 and Vaux had created their design for the recreation of all people, not just the wealthy.\
 The park was to be a place where all New Yorkers could enjoy nature. Its ultimate design\
 (line 40) would retain this feeling.\
 The construction of Central Park was one of the most massive public works projects\
 to take place in 19th-century New York. It required about 20,000 workers to reshape the\
 natural features of the land according to Olmsted and Vaux’s plan. Three hundred\
 thousand cubic yards of rock were blasted into rubble, and the resulting stone was crushed\
 (line 45) to use as paving material. Nearly three million cubic yards of soil were moved, and more\
 than 270,000 trees and shrubs were planted. Swamps were transformed into scenic lakes,\
 and extensive drainage work was done to get rid of small streams and pools. By 1866,\
 more than $5 million had been spent on construction. The park’s final price tag was more\
 than $10 million. In the end, this entirely planned park, stretching from 59th Street to\
 (line 50) 110th Street and from Fifth to Eighth avenues, had a completely natural, unplanned\
 feeling to it.\
 The process of overseeing the park’s construction and accounting for its expenditures\
 exhausted Olmsted. He required a six-week rest cure in Europe in 1859 and suffered a\
 severe broken leg in 1860 that laid him up, but he had the plans for the park spread out in\
 (line 55) his bedroom so he could continue to work. When he tried to resign from the project in\
 1861, however, the commission knew that it could not afford to lose him. Ultimately,\
 Olmsted’s duties and responsibilities were decreased, and when he departed the project to\
 serve in the U.S. Sanitary Commission during the Civil War (1861–1865), the park’s\
 construction was completed under park commission president Andrew Green and Vaux.\
 (line 60) Olmsted’s involvement in Central Park spanned nearly 20 years. It was not the only\
 site he worked or consulted on, and, for a couple of years, other projects demanded his\
 full attention. But from the time their plan was selected until the mid-1870s, Olmsted and\
 Vaux were associated with the park on and off. Sometimes, their titles as landscape\
 architect advisors required little on-site work. At other times, such as when Olmsted filled\
 (line 65) in as acting president of the Department of Public Parks, he looked into establishing lights\
 in the park at night and assessing the park’s safety. By 1878, however, Olmsted’s role with\
 the park officially ended.\
 Today, Central Park stands as one of Olmsted’s greatest legacies. It contains numerous\
 playgrounds and athletic fields. Runners and bicyclists make use of the wide, rolling paths.\
 (line 70) There are places to skate in the winter and boat in the summer. Concerts, plays, and rallies\
 take place there. Sculptures by famous artists can be found throughout the park. There are\
 also quiet places to walk, sit and read a book, or watch birds. Central Park has become a\
 world-famous site that attracts more than 25 million visitors each year. It also is a shining\
 example of Olmsted’s desire to create and preserve public green spaces in urban places for\
 (line 75) generations of people to enjoy.\
How does the information regarding the competition contribute to the reader’s understanding of Vaux and Olmsted?\
(A) Vaux had different ideas from Olmsted regarding the appearance of the park.\
 (B) Vaux and Olmsted carefully considered suggestions made by the committee.\
 (C) Vaux and Olmsted’s collaboration benefited from their distinct abilities.\
 (D) Vaux was more concerned about details than Olmsted.\

In the very heart of Tokyo sits the imperial palace, site of the former Edo Castle. Inside a colossal moat with ramparts that dwarf anything seen in Europe, vast open spaces enclose the last fragments of one of the world’s most imposing seventeenth-century monuments. Across the globe in France, Louis XIV’s palace and gardens of Versailles form a similar impression of artificial mastery of nature and society. Miles of formal gardens punctuated [decorated] with fountains and statuary surround a palace known for its cold magnificence, with the entire ensemble of town, palace, and park orienting itself around a single, central focal point: the Sun King’s bedroom. Each complex symbolizes a system of power. Edo evokes [brings to mind] the Tokugawa rule by status, which decreed that the daimyo lords, who were themselves forced to spend alternate years in Edo away from their regional domains, lived administratively and spatially segregated from the various other categories of subjects, all ranged in a pattern of residential sectors spiraling around the castle. Versailles, in similar fashion, bespeaks [indicates] the domestication of the French aristocracy in a “gilded cage,” where they scrambled for favors while the Sun King undermined their authority and deprived them of their independence. . . .\

. . . At times, gas has been known to travel, with dire results, fifteen miles behind the lines.\
 \
 A gas, or smoke helmet, as it is called, at the best is a vile-smelling thing, and it is not long before one gets a violent headache from wearing it.\
 \
 Our eighteen-pounders were bursting in No Man’s Land, in an effort, by the artillery, to disperse the gas clouds.\
 \
 The fire step was lined with crouching men, bayonets fixed, and bombs near at hand to repel the expected attack.\
 \
 Our artillery had put a barrage of curtain fire on the German lines, to try and break up their attack and keep back re-inforcements.\
 \
 I trained my machine gun on their trench and its bullets were raking the parapet [spraying the wall].\
 \
 Then over they came, bayonets glistening. In their respirators, which have a large snout in front, they looked like some horrible nightmare. . . .\

 …Equally important to English agriculture was the development of new ways of raising crops and animals. About the same time that Townshend was experimenting with turnips and clover, an English farmer, Jethro Tull, introduced a new way of planting seed. In the past, farmers had scattered seed over the surface of a plowed field. Much of this seed was eaten by birds or did not take root.\
    Tull instead proposed planting each seed deeply into the ground and then hoeing around it. The result was a heavy crop yield because more seeds survived and flourished. Tull increased the efficiency of this process by doing the planting with horse-drawn seed drills and hoes.…\
    This agrarian revolution, as it has been called, was every bit as important as the industrial revolution. The availability of good food, combined with improved infant survival and the disappearance of epidemics, helped more young live to adulthood and allowed adults to live longer. This meant that, by the middle of the eighteenth century, more people were having more children, and the population grew quickly thereafter.…\

 Excerpt from Gregor and the Sheep\
 by Toby Rosenstrauch\
 \
 (paragraph 1) In a valley in the highlands of Scotland, there once lived a young tenant farmer, Gregor, and his widowed mother. Although they worked hard, they could never accumulate enough money to buy the flock of sheep they longed to have, for their small parcel of land produced only modest amounts of oats and barley. To make matters\
 worse, MacTavish, the owner of this and many other crofts, always found reasons not to pay the farmers all they had earned. . . .\
 \
 crofts = small farms\
 \
 (paragraph 2) When he opened the door each morning and looked out, he saw MacTavish’s house on top of a mountain, a magnificent stone mansion surrounded by red, pink, and violet rhododendrons. Gregor often climbed the slope and stood outside the iron gates, wondering what fine furnishings and delicious foods lay within. Neighbors claimed\
 that MacTavish owned many houses and even kept a chest of gems under his bed. As Gregor, his mother, and their neighbors grew gaunt and pale with hard work and not enough food, they railed against MacTavish, who had swindled all of them at one time or another.\
 \
 swindled = cheated or tricked\
 \
 (paragraph 3) One day, as Gregor listened to the bagpipe music that drifted from the open windows of MacTavish’s mansion, he had an idea. That night, when his mother was asleep, he emptied the jug that held their money and counted it. After putting back a few coins for food, he put the rest in his pocket. The next morning, he hurried to the market, where he went from farmer to farmer, asking the prices of sheep for sale.\
 Gregor found many handsome animals, but they were all too expensive. When he reached a stall with scrawny and sickly sheep, the owner beckoned to him. . . .\
 \
 (paragraph 4) Gregor shook his head and began to walk away. The man grabbed his sleeve and whispered in his ear, “This one will make her owner rich!” Gregor examined the old sheep with spindly legs and dirty, unkempt wool—the worst of the lot. “If she will make me rich,” said Gregor, “how is it that she has not done so for you?”\
 \
 (paragraph 5) The man paused, thinking. “I have not had her long enough!”\
 \
 (paragraph 6) “Nonsense,” said Gregor, but he gave the man his money and led the pitiful animal home.\
 \
 (paragraph 7) When his mother saw what he had bought with their money, she burst into tears. “My foolish son, what have you done? Now we will starve, and no one will help us!”\
 \
 (paragraph 8) “Do as I say, Mother, and we will be rich. I promise.”\
 \
 (paragraph 9) She wanted to believe him. Wiping her eyes with her ragged sleeve, she asked what he wanted her to do.\
 \
 (paragraph 10) “Go to market and tell everyone that your son has a sheep that will make whoever owns her rich,” said Gregor. . . .\
 \
 (paragraph 11) One morning, a carriage arrived. Two servants opened the door and a stout, welldressed gentleman emerged. His Tartan kilt was made of the finest wool, his ascot was pure silk, and his shoes had silver buckles. On his fat fingers were eight gold rings, and his pomaded hair glistened in the sun. It was MacTavish!\
 \
 Tartan kilt = traditional clothing worn by Scottish Highlanders\
 \
 ascot = a type of necktie\
 \
 (paragraph 12) Gregor bowed as if to royalty. MacTavish looked at him sternly. “I have come to rid you of the unfortunate sheep that everyone is talking about,” said MacTavish, opening his sporran. “I can pay your price and I will have her, even though she has done nothing for you, I see.” MacTavish sneered at Gregor.\
 \
 sporran = a small bag worn at the waist for holding personal items\
 \
 (paragraph 13) Gregor hugged Dear One. “I will not sell her to you!”\
 \
 (paragraph 14) ”At that, MacTavish, whose servants were helping him into his carriage, turned and marched back. “I will pay anything,” he said. “Name the price.”\
 \
 (paragraph 15) Gregor was ready. “That,” he said, pointing up to the mansion above them. “I will have the dwelling and everything in it—furniture, utensils, even the chest of gems under your bed.”\
 \
 (paragraph 16) “Done,” said MacTavish.\
 \
 (paragraph 17) The next day, Gregor and his mother moved into the mansion that had once belonged to MacTavish, and MacTavish brought Dear One to the market so that all might see he could indeed own anything he wanted. Then MacTavish and the sheep rode away in his carriage to another of his houses in a valley beyond the mountains.\
 \
 (paragraph 18) After months had passed and the sheep had done nothing to increase MacTavish’s riches, he realized he had been swindled. Furious beyond speech, he returned to the mansion, but Gregor would not open the gates.\
 \
 (paragraph 19) “I have been cheated!” shouted MacTavish.\
 \
 (paragraph 20) “You have not been cheated,” said Gregor. “I was the owner of the sheep, and she has made me rich, hasn’t she?”\
 \
 (paragraph 21) “Yes, but . . . ,” sputtered MacTavish.\
 \
 (paragraph 22) “Then you got what you paid for.” Gregor turned and walked away.\
 \

Tom is spending the summer on his aunt and uncle's farm. He misses his friend Petie, so he writes letters to Petie describing events on the farm.\
 \
 Excerpt from The Midnight Fox\
 by Betsy Byars\
 (paragraph 1) I had just finished writing this letter and was waiting for a minute to see if I would think of anything to add when I looked up and saw the black fox.\
 (paragraph 2) I did not believe it for a minute. It was like my eyes were playing a trick or something, because I was just sort of staring across this field, thinking about my letter, and then in the distance, where the grass was very green, I saw a fox leaping over the crest of the field. The grass moved and the fox sprang toward the movement, and then, seeing that it was just the wind that had caused the grass to move, she ran straight for the grove of trees where I was sitting\
 (paragraph 3) It was so great that I wanted it to start over again, like you can turn movie film back and see yourself repeat some fine thing you have done, and I wanted to see the fox leaping over the grass again. In all my life I have never been so excited.\
 (paragraph 4) I did not move at all, but I could hear the paper in my hand shaking, and my heart seemed to have moved up in my body and got stuck in my throat.\
 (paragraph 5) The fox came straight toward the grove of trees. She wasn't afraid, and I knew she had not seen me against the tree. I stayed absolutely still even though I felt like jumping up and screaming, \"Aunt Millie! Uncle Fred! Come see this. It's a fox, a fox!\"\
 (paragraph 6) Her steps as she crossed the field were lighter and quicker than a cat's. As she came closer I could see that her black fur was tipped with white. It was as if it were midnight and the moon were shining on her fur, frosting it. The wind parted her fur as it changed directions. Suddenly she stopped. She was ten feet away now, and with the changing of the wind she had got my scent. She looked right at me.\
 (paragraph 7) I did not move for a moment and neither did she. Her head was cocked to one side, her tail curled up, her front left foot raised. In all my life I never saw anything like that fox standing there with her pale golden eyes on me and this great black fur being blown by the wind.\
 (paragraph 8) Suddenly her nose quivered. It was such a slight movement I almost didn't see it, and then her mouth opened and I could see the pink tip of her tongue. She turned. She still was not afraid, but with a bound that was lighter than the wind-it was as if she was being blown away over the field-she was gone.\
 (paragraph 9) Still I didn't move. I couldn't. I couldn't believe that I had really seen the fox.\
 (paragraph 10) I had seen foxes before in zoos, but I was always in such a great hurry to get on to the good stuff that I was saying stupid things like, \"I want to see the go-rilllllas\", and not once had I ever really looked at a fox. Still, I could never remember seeing a black fox, not even in a zoo.\
 (paragraph 11) Also, there was a great deal of difference between seeing an animal in the zoo in front of painted fake rocks and trees and seeing one natural and free in the woods. It was like seeing a kite on the floor and then, later, seeing one up in the sky where it was supposed to be, pulling at the wind.\
 (paragraph 12) I started to pick up my pencil and write as quickly as I could, \"P.S. Today I saw a black fox.\" But I didn't. This was the most exciting thing that had happened to me, and \"P.S. Today I saw a black fox\" made it nothing. \"So what else is happening?\" Petie Burkis would probably write back. I folded my letter, put it in an envelope, and sat there.\
 (paragraph 13) I thought about this old newspaper that my dad had had in his desk drawer for years. It was orange and the headline was just one word, very big, the letters about twelve inches high. WAR! And I mean it was awesome to see that word like that, because you knew it was a word that was going to change your whole life, the whole world even. And every time I would see that newspaper, even though I wasn't even born when it was printed, I couldn't say anything for a minute or two.\
 (paragraph 14) Well, this was the way I felt right then about the black fox. I thought about a newspaper with just one word for a headline, very big, very black letters, twelve inches high. FOX! And even that did not show how awesome it had really been to me.\
Which statement best summarizes how the fox affects Tom?\
(A) Tom regrets not being able to share his experience.\
 (B) Tom feels as though he is in a movie.\
 (C) Tom is deeply moved by the event.\
 (D) Tom can no longer concentrate.\

In West Africa, the Harmattan is a dry, dust-filled wind.\
 Excerpt from A Scrap and a Robe\
 by Myrina D. McCullough\
 \
 (paragraph 1) The West African Harmattan whipped up a billow of dust. Suddenly Sali spied a scrap of glorious orange damask cloth turning in the hot wind like a flame. She followed as it danced down a street she didn’t know very well. She skipped over holes and skirted people on chairs.\
 damask = woven cloth\
 skirted = went around\
 (paragraph 2) All at once the wind died down, and the scrap settled gently on the scratchy, sandy road.\
 (paragraph 3) Sali picked up the cloth and gazed at it with admiring eyes. She turned it this way and that in the sun and imagined herself in a flowing dlokibani made of such cloth. This was a treasure, and she would take it home for her little wooden doll. It would surely make a lovely headpiece for that lucky one.\
 dlokibani or dloki = a long dress\
 (paragraph 4) Sali wandered back the way she had come, slowly now. At the corner of the street, she passed the table vendor, who was selling his dusty packets of tea and two-pill packs of aspirin. She passed Ami’s mother, roasting peanuts and selling them by the handful. She turned onto the larger street and passed a plastic-goods store that displayed rows and rows of brightly colored plastic plates, bowls, and teapots. She glanced into the next shop and then stopped short. It was a fabric shop! There on the high counter was an entire bolt of the same wondrous cloth she held in her hand!\
 (paragraph 5) The next day Sali went back to the cloth shop. She stood near the door and watched the storekeeper. He measured and cut, as one person after another bought pieces of cloth. Her prized orange damask was back on a high shelf to the rear of the store.\
 (paragraph 6) After a while the shopkeeper looked at Sali. “Why do you stand so long at the door?” he asked.\
 (paragraph 7) Sali took a deep breath and said, “I would like to help you in the store till I could earn enough of that orange cloth to make a dlokibani for myself.”\
 (paragraph 8) The orange fabric glowed in a shaft of light from the uncovered bulb at the back of the store.\
 (paragraph 9) “That is very special and expensive cloth, little one,” the shopkeeper told her.\
 (paragraph 10) So she swept the courtyard and threw away scraps. She pushed big rolls of cloth back and forth. She ran to buy cough drops and peanuts and kola nuts for the shopkeeper. For days and days she worked.\
 (paragraph 11) Finally, one day the store owner lifted down the lustrous roll of orange damask and measured out several yards. “You’ve worked well for this cloth, Sali,” he said. “I thank you.”\
 (paragraph 12) Sali rushed straight home with her treasure. Carefully she placed the cloth in her trunk.\
 (paragraph 13) But how was she to get the dloki made? Sali did not know how to sew. Her mother always had their clothes made by a tailor who sat in a tiny shop several blocks from their house.\
 (paragraph 14) Sali went and stood under a tree near the tailor’s shop. She watched the people come and go. The tailor would whip out his measuring tape and see how tall the people were, how fat they were, how long their arms, how short their necks. He measured every part of them.\
 (paragraph 15) After almost a whole day the tailor noticed Sali.\
 (paragraph 16) “What are you doing there, little girl?” he asked.\
 (paragraph 17) “I have some beautiful cloth,” she said, “and I want it sewn into a dlokibani. Could I work for you to pay for sewing it into a robe for me?”\
 (paragraph 18) The tailor agreed. Once again Sali worked for days and days. She swept and fanned the tea coals and held scissors and brought thread. At last, the tailor said, “Bring me the cloth, Sali.”\
 (paragraph 19) Sali rushed home and brought back the satiny, shining cloth. She also brought her doll, its small head still neatly wrapped in the swatch of orange. The tailor took his tape and measured Sali, shoulder to ankle, shoulder to elbow, left shoulder to right shoulder. Then he started cutting the billows of orange fabric.\
 (paragraph 20) The next day was an important holiday called Tabaski. Drums were beating in many neighborhoods. Relatives and friends came to visit Sali’s family. Sali slipped quietly away. Soon her mother missed her. “Now where has Sali gone?” she exclaimed.\
 (paragraph 21) Just then, Sali walked in, proudly wearing a beautiful orange dloki with a matching headdress. In her arms she carried her doll, dressed exactly as she was!\
Which statement best expresses a theme of the story?\
(A) It is wise to work in secret if a dream is not supported by relatives.\
 (B) Working with new people can be scary, but will become easier over time.\
 (C) Beautiful objects can bring happiness, but they are often not worth the price.\
 (D) Determination and creative thinking can help people overcome challenges.\

Talking with Artists:\
 David Wiesner\
 compiled and edited by Pat Cummings\
 MY STORY\
 (paragraph 1) I think that I always knew I wanted to become an artist. I can't remember a time when I wasn't drawing and painting pictures. My oldest sister and my brother were artistic, and watching them draw fascinated me. They had many different art supplies around the house. There was, and still is, something very appealing about art materials: Boxes of pastels, with incredibly colored, thin, square sticks, fitting snugly into the slots in their trays. Little ink bottles with rubber stoppers and pens with interchangeable metal tips. The look, smell, and feel of rich black ink going onto bright white paper in broad, flat strokes or thin, sharp lines. I found this captivating.\
 (paragraph 2) In our town, the housepaint and wallpaper store also sold art supplies. I loved looking at all the exotic things they had for sale. Sandpaper blocks to sharpen pencils. Rows of numbered pencils, and erasers that could be pulled ike taffy. Thin drawers full of tubes of paint that seemed so much more grown up than the kind we used at school. Complicated easels and wooden boxes to hold everything.\
 (paragraph 3) My parents and friends soon saw that I had more than a passing interest in art. It came to define much of my image. Relatives gave me art-related birthday gifts. At school I became \"the kid who could draw\", a unique distinction, like \"brainiest\" or \"best athlete\"-but somehow different. A little weird, actually. I like that.\
 (paragraph 4) In my kindergarten class, we had an \"art corner\". There was an easel with a large pad of paper and poster paints. One day I was painting a picture of a red house. I can vividly recall my intense frustration because this picture just didn't look like I wanted it to.\
 (paragraph 5) As I got a little older, I began copying pictures: cartoons, comic books, and magazine illustrations. But mostly dinosaurs. I loved them. The World Book Encyclopedia published a book about the history of the earth, full of very realistic dinosaur pictures that I drew over and over again. They were in black and white and had a hazy quality to them (bad printing, I think). For a long time, even after I should have known better, I thought they were photographs of dinosaurs.\
 (paragraph 6) I found out a few years ago that these particular paintings are murals in the Chicago Field Museum. I've since seen them in person. They were painted by Charles Knight, the first and most famous painter of dinosaurs. They are still impressive, and they are in color!\
 (paragraph 7) My third-grade class wrote essays on what we wanted to be when we grew up. To me it was obvious. We read them aloud, and I told about the types of paintings I would some day try. I'd have turtles with paintbrushes tied to their backs walking around on a big sheet of paper (I got chuckles from the class and the teacher). Or I'd fill squirt guns with different colored paints and shoot at the canvas. I actually tried this with friends! Well, it sounded like a good idea.\
 (paragraph 8) One of the only discouraging childhood experiences about my artwork happened in the fourth grade. During study time I was drawing a picture. My teacher took it away and wrote an angry note home to my mother. \"David would rather be drawing pictures than doing his work!!!\" I couldn't believe it, three exclamation points. We didn't get along well for the rest of the year. School \"art classes\" were pretty uninspiring. I did my best work on textbook covers I made. Art never seemed to be taken as seriously as other subjects.\
 (paragraph 9) In the eighth grade, a big career day was held. Months before, we wrote suggestions for careers we wanted to hear about. On the big day, guest speakers from many fields came to talk. We each chose two sessions to attend, but there wasn't one that came close to an art-related field. I saw some guy talk about oceanography.\
 (paragraph 10) In high school it actually sank in that I was going to be an artist. My friends read catalogs and saw guidance counselors to pick what they'd study in college. I felt something was wrong. I already knew. I'd always known. I half expected to hear, \"No, put away those paints and choose a real career.\" My parents were excited about my choice, too. As I looked into art schools, I felt like doors were being thrown wide open. Until then my art was a private thing, but at art school I found a place where everyone was \"the kid who could draw.\"\
Paragraphs 10 and 3 are connected because\
(A) paragraph 10 confirms how surprised Wiesner felt about the label he was given as a child\
 (B) paragraph 10 shows how Wiesner's friends responded to his childhood interest\
 (C) paragraph 10 tells how Wiesner finally found others who shared his creativity\
 (D) paragraph 10 describes how Wiesner's image had changed\

Reading Comprehension Passage C\
 \
 …Nowhere is light pollution more apparent, almost achingly so, than in satellite images\
 of the Earth from space. The continental United States seems to split in half: the eastern\
 side is brighter than the west, except for the klieg lights of Las Vegas. Highways innervate (innervate - energize)\
 America, connecting luminous dots of small towns and big cities. Across the Atlantic,\
 (line 5) Europe shimmers. Moscow is a radiant nine-pointed star. The Nile Delta glows like a\
 dandelion sprouting from mostly indigo Africa. Farther east, Hong Kong and Shanghai are\
 ablaze, and the demilitarised zone separates dark North Korea from South Korea more\
 cleanly than if the peninsula had been cleft in two. Developed society, it’s clear, is where the\
 light is.\
 \
 (line 10) Human-controlled light has pierced the night for thousands of years, long before\
 [Thomas] Edison. Campfires warmed our ancestors’ feet and cooked their meals; the\
 Harvard anthropologist Richard Wrangham argues in his book Catching Fire (2009) that\
 gathering around a flame to eat and to commune with others is, in fact, what made us\
 human. Not just fellowship but safety has long been the primary rationale for pushing back\
 (line 15) the night. ‘Evil spirits love not the smell of lamps,’ as Plato put it. Comforting, lambent (lambent — glowing or flickering with a soft radiance) \
 lamplight led us safely home by tattling on the people and potholes and animals that would\
 otherwise do us harm. By the early 17th century, residents of cities such as Paris and London\
 were admonished (admonished — warned) to keep lights burning in the windows of all houses that faced the streets,\
 as the historian A. Roger Ekirch notes in his book At Day’s Close: Night in Times Past\
 (line 20) (2005). Taxpayers funded oil lamps and candlelit lanterns for the avenues, while only\
 genteel households could afford fine beeswax or spermaceti candles; most people relied on\
 tallow, made from animal fat. …\
 \
 And even so — what price safety! A young but rapidly growing field of research suggests\
 that night-time light itself is far more dangerous than the dark. In a 2012 report, an\
 (line 25) American Medical Association committee called electric lighting a ‘man-made self-\
 experiment’ creating potentially harmful health effects. Humans, and everything else that\
 lives on this planet with us, evolved during billions of years along a reliable cycle of day and\
 night, with clear boundaries between them. Staunching the flood of artificial light can help\
 restore this divide. Our well-being, and that of our fellow creatures, might depend on us\
 (line 30) doing so — or at the very least trying. The loss of night-time darkness neglects our shared\
 past, but it might very well cut short our futures too. …\
 \
 A growing body of evidence shows that light pollution exacerbates (exacerbates — makes a situation worse),  and might directly\
 cause, cancer, obesity, and depression, the troublesome triumvirate (triumvirate — a group of three holding power) of industrialised\
 society. One of the first people to notice this correlation, at least as it applies to cancer, is\
 (line 35) Richard Stevens, a professor at the University of Connecticut, respected cancer\
 epidemiologist (epidemiologist — health professional who investigates patterns and causes of diseases), and mild insomniac. In the early 1980s, Stevens and other researchers\
 were beginning to realise there was little or no connection between diet and rising rates \
 breast cancer, contrary to what had been suspected. As Stevens puts it, it was like a light\
 bulb going on when he realised that, in fact, a light bulb going on might be a culprit. …\
 \
 (line 40) ‘Rather than falling, night, to the watchful eye, rises,’ writes Ekirch in At Day’s Close.\
 Shadows creep up lows and valleys first, then consume hillsides and houses and the tallest\
 buildings. Muted greys and deeper blues chase off the sun until finally the sky leaks no\
 colour. When we sleep according to a solar cycle, melatonin (melantonin - hormone that regulates sleep and wakefulness) production follows this\
 pattern, rising with the night. But artificial light tamps it down. This is frustratingly\
 (line 45) apparent for a special class of humans who experience sunsets every 90 minutes: astronauts.\
 \
 One of the most frequent complaints of orbital crew members is insomnia; they pop\
 sleeping pills on a regular basis, and still get only about six hours of shuteye, though they’re\
 allotted eight. Steven W. Lockley, a Harvard neuroscientist, recommends altering the light\
 to improve matters. In 2012, he advised NASA [National Aeronautics and Space\
 (line 50) Administration] engineers to change the light bulbs on the International Space Station to a\
 type of LED that can display blue-shifted light during the ‘day’, when the crew is working,\
 and red-shifted light when they need to rest. Why the difference? That crucial ganglion (ganglion — mass of nerve tissues in the brain),\
 the circadian (circadian — 24-hour biological cycle) photoreceptor, is particularly sensitive to light toward the bluish end of the\
 red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo and violet visible-light spectrum. …\
 \
 (line 55) Insomnia is hardly the worst side effect of light pollution. Shift workers, who rise with\
 the night and work awash in blue light, experience not only disrupted circadian rhythms and\
 sleep deprivation, but an increased risk of breast and prostate cancer. These cancers, which\
 require hormones to grow, are suppressed in the presence of melatonin, Stevens has shown.\
 In 2010, Stevens published a review of breast cancer sensitivity in 164 countries, and found\
 (line 60) a 30 to 50 per cent increased risk of cancer in nations with the worst light pollution, but no\
 increased prevalence of non-hormonally dependent cancers in the same populations.\
 \
 ‘Our use of electric light in the modern world is disrupting our circadian sleep and our\
 biology. There is no question about that. Does that have physiological consequences? There\
 is more and more evidence that it does,’ Stevens told me. ‘The epidemiological studies are\
 (line 65) the crudest, but the most important.’ …\
 \
 When we, in the industrialised world, do manage to turn off the lights, there are\
 measurable, beneficial effects on our circadian rhythms. In a widely reported paper last\
 summer, Kenneth Wright at the University of Colorado at Boulder took eight students\
 camping in the Rocky Mountains for two weeks. They weren’t allowed to use any artificial\
 (line 70) light after the sun went down — only the sanguine (sanguine — red) glow of campfire. After a week,\
 melatonin started to rise at sunset, peak in the middle of the night, and taper just at sunrise,\
 which Wright called a ‘remarkable’ result. ‘Internal biological time under natural light-dark\
 conditions tightly synchronises to environmental time, and in this regard, humans are\
 comparable to other animals,’ he wrote. …\
 \
 (line 75) For those of us addicted to our glowing phones and tablets, an app called F.lux can help.\
 It ‘warms’ your device’s display screen so that it shifts red in the evening, more closely\
 matching incandescent bulbs and the hue of the setting sun. Just a brief glimpse at your\
 mobile phone at bedtime is enough to expose your retinas to artificial light, so fighting such\
 a comprehensive intrusion might be an exercise in futility. But even if we can’t completely\
 (line 80) quench our thirst for light, we can all make one small gesture, which could prompt us to\
 unplug a little more. …\

This is the true story of a Kenyan woman named Wangari Maathai.\
 \
 Excerpt from Seeds of Change:\
 Planting a Path to Peace\
 \
 by Jen Cullerton Johnson\
 \
 (paragraph 1) “Come,” Wangari’s mother called. She beckoned her young daughter over to a tall tree with a wide, smooth trunk and a crown of green, oval leaves.\
 \
 (paragraph 2) “Feel,” her mother whispered.\
 \
 (paragraph 3) Wangari spread her small hands over the tree’s trunk. She smoothed her fingers over the rough bark.\
 \
 (paragraph 4) “This is the mugumo,” her mother said. “It is home to many. It feeds many too.”\
 \
 (paragraph 5) She snapped off a wild fig from a low branch, and gave it to her daughter. Wangari ate the delicious fruit, just as geckos and elephants did. High in the tree, birds chirped in their nests. The branches bounced with jumping monkeys.\
 \
 (paragraph 6) “Our people, the Kikuyu of Kenya, believe that our ancestors rest in the tree’s shade,” her mother explained.\
 \
 (paragraph 7) Wangari wrapped her arms around the trunk as if hugging her great-grandmother’s spirit. She promised never to cut down the tree. . . .\
 \
 ((paragraph 8) When Wangari finished elementary school, she was eleven years old. Her mind was like a seed rooted in rich soil, ready to grow. Wangari wanted to continue her education, but to do so she would have to leave her village and move to the capital city of Nairobi. Wangari had never been farther than her valley’s ridge. She was scared.\
 \
 (paragraph 9) “Go,” her mother said. She picked up a handful of earth and placed it gently into her daughter’s hand. “Where you go, we go.” . . .\
 \
 (paragraph 10) As graduation neared, Wangari told her friends she wanted to become a biologist.\
 \
 (paragraph 11) “Not many native women become biologists,” they told her.\
 \
 (paragraph 12) “I will,” she said.\
 \
 (paragraph 13) Wangari watched sadly as her government sold more and more land to big companies that cut down forests for timber and to clear land for coffee plantations. Native trees such as cedar and acacia vanished. Without trees, birds had no place to nest. Monkeys lost their swings. Tired mothers walked miles for firewood. . . .\
 \
 (paragraph 14) When Wangari visited her village she saw that the Kikuyu custom of not chopping down the mugumo trees had been lost. No longer held in place by tree roots, the soil streamed into the rivers. The water that had been used to grow maize, bananas, and sweet potatoes turned to mud and dried up. Many families went hungry.\
 \
 (paragraph 15) Wangari could not bear to think of the land being destroyed. Now married and the mother of three children, she worried about what would happen to the mothers and children who depended on the land.\
 \
 (paragraph 16) “We must do something,” Wangari said.\
 \
 (paragraph 17) Wangari had an idea as small as a seed but as tall as a tree that reaches for the sky. “Harabee! Let’s work together!” she said to her countrywomen—mothers like her. Wangari dug deep into the soil, a seedling by her side. “We must plant trees.” . . .\
 \
 (paragraph 18) Wangari traveled to villages, towns, and cities with saplings and seeds, shovels and hoes. At each place she went, women planted rows of trees that looked like green belts across the land. Because of this they started calling themselves the Green Belt Movement.\
 \
 (paragraph 19) “We might not change the big world but we can change the landscape of the forest,” she said.\
 \
 (paragraph 20) One tree turned to ten, ten to one hundred, one hundred to one million, all the way up to thirty million planted trees. Kenya grew green again. Birds nested in new trees. Monkeys swung on branches. Rivers filled with clean water. Wild figs grew heavy in mugumo branches.\
 \
 (paragraph 21) Mothers fed their children maize, bananas, and sweet potatoes until they could eat no more.\
Paragraphs 17 and 18 explain that Wangari spread her idea by\
(A) sharing it with women around the coun\
 (B) giving it the name Green Belt Movement\
 (C) watching the land in Kenya turn green again\
 (D) planting trees herself everywhere she went\

Female mosquitoes spread diseases when they bite humans to obtain blood. It is only the females that do the biting. Research is being conducted to alter the DNA of male mosquitoes. These altered males could then mate with normal female mosquitoes. All of the resulting female offspring would have wing defects that prevent them from flying.\
One assumption from this research is that the\
(1) altered males would begin to bite humans and spread the diseases\
 (2) female offspring would be unable to bite humans, since they cannot fly\
 (3) altered males would not be able to reproduce\
 (4) female offspring would become larger in size\

 Excerpt from Waste Not, Want Not\
 by Teresa Bateman\
 \
 (paragraph 1) My mother believed in using things up. We always squeezed the toothpaste tube until it was as sharp as a razor, and we cleaned our plates, even when it was liver-andonions\
 night. . . .\
 \
 (paragraph 2) Mom’s frugality was legendary. She could make one chicken come back in a dozen meals as variously disguised leftovers. Her favorite saying was “waste not, want not.” Josh and I weren’t sure what that meant, but it probably explained why Mom was into recycling long before it became popular. It also explained why the “Affair of the Hat,” as it later became known, was so strange.\
 \
 (paragraph 3) The Hat deserved capital letters. It was about three feet across, made of green straw and covered with big plastic daisies, two red peonies, and an orange bow. I might have said it was “dog ugly,” except that wouldn’t sit well with our dog, Mutt.\
 \
 (paragraph 4) Great-aunt Marjorie had given The Hat to Mother on one of her visits to our farm. It was supposed to keep the sun off Mother’s delicate complexion while enhancing her rural beauty (whatever that meant). . . .\
 \
 (paragraph 5) When Aunt Marjorie returned to the city, Josh and I held our breath to see what would happen to The Hat. We could see that Mom’s thrifty nature and fashion sense were in pitched battle. She couldn’t justify throwing The Hat away—it was nearly new and had a lot of use left in it—but neither could she stomach wearing it. She tried pulling off the daisies and peonies, but they were stuck on tight, as were the perky orange ribbons that held The Hat in place. She’d have to find some other solution.\
 \
 (paragraph 6) One day Josh and I came down to breakfast and noticed that The Hat was missing from the hook by the door. We looked at each other, then scouted the house. It wasn’t hard to spot. Mother had installed it in the parlor as a lampshade.\
 \
 (paragraph 7) Our parakeet, Pete, chirped inquiringly from his cage as Josh and I decided to see how The Hat looked in full lampshade glory. We pulled the chain.\
 \
 (paragraph 8 ) Pete tweeted once, then dropped like a stone from his perch. We ran to his cage, and Josh suggested mouth-to-beak resuscitation. Then we glanced over at the lamp. The light shining through the peonies made them look like two big red eyes glaring at you. No wonder Pete had fainted. We plucked The Hat from the lamp and went to tell Mom. Reluctantly she hung it back up on the hook by the door. . . .\
 \
 (paragraph 9) The next morning she headed out the door, The Hat filled to the brim with turkey feed. Josh and I watched as Mother approached the turkeys scavenging in the barnyard. The minute those turkeys sighted The Hat, they ran gobbling toward the barn door and dived in a panic into the haystack. Mom dumped the turkey feed in the barnyard and\
 walked back to the house, her shoulders drooping. . . .\
 \
 (paragraph 10) She threw The Hat to the floor, raised her foot, and screamed, “THIS HAT IS FOR THE BIRDS!” Josh and I stepped back, waiting for her foot to come crashing down.\
 \
 (paragraph 11) “It is not for the birds,” Josh blurted. \"They hate it!”\
 \
 (paragraph 12) It was as though time stood still. Then we heard a strange sound. Mother was laughing!\
 \
 (paragraph 13) We shook our heads. She’d finally gone over the edge—there she stood, one foot in the air, laughing like a hysterical flamingo.\
 \
 (paragraph 14) Then she put her foot down . . . on the floor. She picked up The Hat and headed upstairs where we heard boxes being shuffled around in the attic. . .\
 \
 (paragraph 15) When she came down, she was dragging a body. It was wearing Grandpa’s old overalls, Uncle Paul’s flannel shirt, and the shoes Josh had outgrown last year. Its head was a flour sack, stuffed full of straw from an old tick, and on that head perched The Hat.\
 \
 tick = mattress\
 \
 (paragraph 16) Mom hauled the stuffed body outside and set it up on a post in the middle of the cornfield. And that’s where it stayed.\
 \
 (paragraph 17) Our corn crop that year was particularly good. For some reason the birds steered clear of our fields and raided the neighbors’ instead. Maybe it had something to do with our scarecrow, I don’t know. All I do know is that from then on, we rarely saw crows on our property except during the month of June.\
 \
 (paragraph 16) That’s when Great-aunt Marjorie comes to visit.\
In paragraph 5, what does the phrase “held our breath” suggest about the narrator and Josh?\
(A) They are sneaking around the house to avoid being seen by Mother.\
 (B) They are feeling thankful that Aunt Marjorie has left.\
 (C) They are waiting anxiously to see what Mother will do next.\
 (D) They are trying to avoid talking about The Hat because it is upsetting.\

Reading Comprehension Passage A\
 \
 The factory made the best centrifugal pumps in the world, and Merle Waggoner owned\
 it. He’d started it. He’d just been offered two million dollars for it by the General Forge and\
 Foundry Company. He didn’t have any stockholders and he didn’t owe a dime. He was\
 fifty-one, a widower, and he had one heir—a son. The boy’s name was Franklin. The boy\
 (line 5) was named after Benjamin Franklin.\
 \
 One Friday afternoon father and son came out of Merle’s office and into the factory.\
 They went down a factory aisle to Rudy Linberg’s lathe. (lathe — a machine on which a piece of material, such as wood or metal, is spun and shaped against a fixed\
 cutting tool)\
 \
 “Rudy,” said Merle, “the boy here’s home from college for three days, and I thought\
 maybe you and him and your boy and me might go out to the farm and shoot some clay\
 (line 10) pigeons tomorrow.”\
 \
 Rudy turned his sky-blue eyes to Merle and young Franklin. He was Merle’s age, and\
 he had the deep and narrow dignity of a man who had learned his limitations early—who\
 had never tried to go beyond them. His limitations were those of his tools, his flute and his\
 shotgun. …\
 \
 (line 15) “Let’s go ask my boy what he’s got on tomorrow,” said Rudy. It was a formality. Karl\
 always did what his father wanted him to do—did it with profound love. …\
 \
 Karl was a carbon copy of his father. He was such a good mimic of Rudy that his joints\
 seemed to ache a little with age. He seemed sobered by fifty-one years of life, though he’d\
 lived only twenty. He seemed instinctively wary of safety hazards that had been eliminated\
 (line 20) from the factory by the time he’d learned to walk. Karl stood at attention without humility,\
 just as his father had done.\
 \
 “Want to go shooting tomorrow?” said Rudy.\
 “Shoot what?” said Karl.\
 “Crows. Clay pigeons,” said Rudy. “Maybe a woodchuck.”\
 \
 (line 25)“Don’t mind,” said Karl. He nodded briefly to Merle and Franklin. “Glad to.” …\
 Rudy nodded. He examined the work in Karl’s lathe and tapped his own temple. The\
 tapping was a signal that Franklin had seen many times on hunts. It meant that Karl was\
 doing fine.\
 \
 Rudy touched Karl’s elbow lightly. It was the signal for Karl to get back to work. Rudy\
 (line 30) and Karl each held up a crooked finger and saluted with it. Franklin knew what that meant\
 too. It meant, “Good-by, I love you.” …\
 \
 Merle was sitting at his desk, his head down, when Franklin came in. He held a steel\
 plate about six inches square in his left hand. In the middle of the plate was a hole two inches\
 square. In his right hand he held a steel cube that fitted the hole exactly. …\
 \
 (line 35) Franklin sat down gingerly on a hard chair by the wall. The office hadn’t changed much\
 in the years he’d known it. It was one more factory room, with naked pipes overhead—the\
 cold ones sweaty, the hot ones dry. Wires snaked from steel box to steel box. The green walls\
 and cream trim were as rough as elephant hide in some places, with alternating coats of\
 paint and grime, paint and grime.\
 \
 (line 40) There had never been time to scrape away the layers, and barely enough time,\
 overnight, to slap on new paint. And there had never been time in which to finish the rough\
 shelves that lined the room. …\
 \
 Merle slipped the cube through the square hole once more. “Know what these are?” he\
 said.\
 \
 (line 45) “Yes, sir,” said Franklin. “They’re what Rudy Linberg had to make when he was an\
 apprentice in Sweden.”\
 The cube could be slipped through the hole in twenty-four different ways, without\
 letting the tiniest ray of light pass through with it.\
 \
 “Unbelievable skill,” said Franklin respectfully. “There aren’t craftsmen like that\
 (line 50) coming along any more.” He didn’t really feel much respect. He was simply saying what he\
 knew his father wanted to hear. The cube and the hole struck him as criminal wastes of time\
 and great bores. “Unbelievable,” he said again.\
 \
 “It’s utterly unbelievable, when you realize that Rudy didn’t make them,” said Merle\
 gravely, “when you realize what generation the man who made them belongs to.”\
 \
 (line 55) “Oh?” said Franklin. “Who did make them?”\
 \
 “Rudy’s boy, Karl,” said Merle. “A member of your generation.” He ground out his cigar\
 sadly. “He gave them to me on my last birthday. They were on my desk, boy, waiting for me\
 when I came in—right beside the ones Rudy gave me thirty-one years before.” …\
 \
 “I could have cried, boy, when I saw those two plates and those two cubes side by side,”\
 (line 60) said Merle. “Can you understand that?” he asked beseechingly. “Can you understand why\
 I’d feel like crying?” …\
 \
 “The cube of Karl’s fitted through the hole of Rudy’s!” said Merle. “They were\
 interchangeable!”\
 \
 “Gosh!” said Franklin. “I’ll be darned. Really?”\
 \
 (line 65) And now he felt like crying, because he didn’t care, couldn’t care—and would have\
 given his right arm to care. The factory whanged and banged and screeched in monstrous\
 irrelevance—Franklin’s, all Franklin’s, if he just said the word.\
 \
 “What’ll you do with it—buy a theater in New York?” said Merle abruptly.\
 \
 “Do with what, sir?” said Franklin.\
 \
 (line 70) “The money I’ll get for the factory when I sell it—the money I’ll leave to you when I’m\
 dead,” said Merle. He hit the word “dead” hard. “What’s Waggoner Pump going to be\
 converted into? Waggoner Theaters? Waggoner School of Acting? The Waggoner Home for\
 Broken-Down Actors?”\
 \
 “I—I hadn’t thought about it,” said Franklin. The idea of converting Waggoner Pump\
 (line 75) into something equally complicated hadn’t occurred to him, and appalled him now. He was\
 being asked to match his father’s passion for the factory with an equal passion for something\
 else. And Franklin had no such passion—for the theater or anything else. …\
 \
 “Don’t sell on my account,” said Franklin wretchedly.\
 \
 “On whose account would I keep it?” said Merle.\
 \
 (line 80) “Do you have to sell it today?” said Franklin, horrified.\
 \
 “Strike while the iron’s hot, I always say,” said Merle. “Today’s the day you decided to\
 be an actor, and, as luck would have it, we have an excellent offer for what I did with my\
 life.”\
 \
 “Couldn’t we wait?”\
 \
 (line 85) “For what?” said Merle. He was having a good time now.\
 \
 “Father!” cried Franklin. “For the love of heaven, father, please!” He hung his head and\
 shook it. “I don’t know what I’m doing,” he said brokenly. “I don’t know for sure what I want\
 to do yet. I’m just playing with ideas, trying to find myself. Please, father, don’t sell what\
 you’ve done with your life, don’t just throw it away because I’m not sure I want to do that\
 (line 90) with my life too! Please!” Franklin looked up. “I’m not Karl Linberg,” he said. “I can’t help\
 it. I’m sorry, but I’m not Karl Linberg.” …\

 Excerpt from a letter by Chinese Commissioner Lin Zexu to Queen Victoria August 27, 1839\
 \
 . . . Your country is more than 60,000 li [18,641 miles] from China. The purpose of your ships in coming to China is to realize a large profit. Since this profit is realized in China and is in fact taken away from the Chinese people, how can foreigners return injury for the benefit they have received by sending this poison to harm their benefactors? They may not intend to harm others on purpose, but the fact remains that they are so obsessed with material gain that they have no concern whatever for the harm they can cause to others. Have they no conscience? I have heard that you strictly prohibit opium in your own country, indicating unmistakably that you know how harmful opium is. You do not wish opium to harm your own country, but you choose to bring that harm to other countries such as China. Why?. . .\

Reading Comprehension Passage C\
 \
 Get That Song Outta My Head!\
 \
    The nightmare began when my husband walked into our kitchen and said, “I’ve had this\
 song stuck in my head all day …”\
    No! I thought. Don’t say it!\
    “Remember that song from the original Karate Kid movie?” he continued.\
 (line 5)   For the love of God, no!\
    “You know how it goes. ‘You’re the best around … na na na na na, na na na na. You’re\
 the best around …”\
    It was too late. Now I had an earworm — a song, melody or jingle that gets stuck in your\
 head.\
 (line 10)   The worst part? I only knew that same line. I walked around humming it for days. I tried\
 to shake it by singing along with tunes playing on my car radio while I was out running\
 errands. For a brief time, Van Halen’s “Runnin’ With the Devil” replaced it.\
    But in no time at all, that one line from “You’re the Best,” sung by Joe Esposito on the\
 The Karate Kid soundtrack, was back.\
 (line 15)   Perhaps if I heard more of the song in my head, it wouldn’t be as annoying. But just this\
 one line? Over and over and over again? It was pure torture. I needed to do something\
 drastic. I busted out that 1980s hit, “The Safety Dance” by Men Without Hats. After singing\
 it a few times, the earworm was gone.\
    I knew I’d get another one, though. About 90 percent of people experience earworms\
 (line 20) at least once a week, according to the Earworm Project run by the Music, Mind and Brain\
 group at Goldsmiths, University of London.\
    “Music lovers, specifically people who ascribe (ascribe - credit) more importance to music or people\
 who spend more time listening to music, have more frequent and longer earworm\
 episodes,” says Kelly Jakubowski, a researcher with the Earworm Project. …\
 (line 25)   To find out what causes earworms and how to get rid of them, I contacted the man\
 known as “Dr. Earworm,” James Kellaris, a marketing professor at the University of\
 Cincinnati. Certainly with a nickname like that, he would know something.\
    Kellaris began studying earworms in 1999. A former professional musician prone to\
 getting earworms himself, he eventually became a marketing professor “interested in how\
 (line 30) marketers use music to achieve various commercial goals,” he says. “It was a perfect storm\
 to create an earworms researcher.”\
    He explained to me that when we get an earworm, the tune seems to repeat itself\
 involuntarily, which is why experts consider earworms involuntary musical imagery (INMI).\
 This was exactly what “You’re the Best” had done to me.\
 (line 35)   So what, precisely, was happening in my brain when I couldn’t shake that tune?\
 Jakubowski contributed to a May 2015 study led by Nicolas Farrugia, a postdoctoral\
 researcher with the Earworm Project, that demonstrated auditory and inhibitory-related\
 areas play a role in earworms as well.\
    The researchers examined 44 healthy subjects, all between 25 and 70 years old and all\
 (line 40) participants of a past neuroimaging study run by the Cambridge Medical Research\
 Council’s Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit. These subjects took an online survey that\
 measured both the extent of their musical training and how strongly INMIs impacted them.\
 For example, the survey wanted to know how strong of a negative impact INMIs had on\
 them or if INMIs were actually helpful while they went about their everyday activities.\
 (line 45)   When they examined these participants’ brain images, one pattern in particular stuck\
 out: People who got earworms more often had a thinner right frontal cortex, which is\
 involved in inhibition, (inhibition -restraining behavior) and a thinner temporal cortex, which processes sensory stimuli like\
 sound. In other words, these people’s brains just weren’t as good at suppressing the random\
 song that might pop into their heads.\
 (line 50)   Why we get earworms, unfortunately, remains a scientific mystery. “We know that songs\
 that are ‘catchy’ — short, simple, repetitive and contain some incongruity — are most likely\
 to get stuck,” Kellaris says. Most people are more likely to get a song like “Don’t Worry, Be\
 Happy” stuck in their heads than, say, a Mahler symphony. And some things exacerbate\
 them: frequency and duration of exposure to music, worry, stress, fatigue and idleness.\
 (line 55)   Considering that my husband kept singing the snippet (snippet - short piece) while I was tired and stressed,\
 I can see why it got stuck. But my earworms have been relatively innocuous. (innocuous - harmless) Even though\
 they’re annoying, I can eventually get rid of them. Some people can’t, though.\
    Part of Kellaris’ earliest research involved mailing a questionnaire to about 1,000\
 respondents at four U.S. universities. He asked them if they’d ever had an earworm, for how\
 (line 60) long, how often it happened, how it made them feel, etc.\
    One respondent claimed to have had a song stuck in his head since 1978. This is known\
 as intrusive musical imagery (IMI), a musical obsession that’s chronic and highly distracting\
 to a person’s everyday life and work. According to Dean McKay, a psychology professor at\
 Fordham University, my short-lived earworm was nothing compared to an IMI.\
 (line 65)   But now I was concerned. Could my future earworms turn into these IMIs? Is there a\
 way to prevent this from happening?\
    McKay co-authored a June 2014 study titled “Musical obsessions: A comprehensive\
 review of neglected clinical phenomena.” For this study, McKay and other international\
 colleagues, all of whom treat obsessive-compulsive disorder, created the first\
 (line 70) comprehensive review of musical obsessions. They compiled a database of 96 case study\
 descriptions of people with severe musical obsessions — the largest compilation (compilation - collection) assembled\
 on this topic. They determined the characteristics of musical obsessions such as IMIs and\
 compared them with earworms, musical hallucinations and visual obsessional imagery.\
    The group’s research showed that IMIs can be treated by using a method known as\
 (line 75) distraction — coming up with a competing melody to think about that would get rid of the\
 IMI. That’s exactly what I had done, albeit unknowingly, when I used “The Safety Dance”\
 to stop my earworm.\
    McKay says my earworm was pesky because I knew only that one part of the song. He\
 suggests if I have just a portion of a song looping in my brain in the future, I can try another\
 (line 80) method called exposure — simply listening to the entire song. “It’s like a completion task,”\
 he says. “Once you know the whole song, then there’s no need for it to be stuck in your\
 head.”\
    Another form of distraction is to sing the song out loud, but change some of the words\
 or slightly throw off the melody. One of McKay’s patients had an IMI based on a Taylor\
 (line 85) Swift song. “We made up some other words for it,” he explains. “We messed up the melody\
 a bit, but not so much that it wasn’t recognizable as still being that song, and then it faded.”\
 McKay stresses that this is the only case he’s tried this in, so it’s not a forgone conclusion\
 this kind of distraction would work in other instances.\
    What I wanted to know was if the earworm I get today could become the IMI of\
 (line 90) tomorrow.\
    “Highly improbable,” he says.\
    “You’re the best,” I reply.\
    Oh no.\

Excerpt from A la Carte\
 \
 by Tanita S. Davis\
 \
 (paragraph 1) “Homework?” My mother mouths the word exaggeratedly, eyebrows raised, and I roll my eyes. Frowning, she points with her chin to the side door that leads to the stairs. I roll my eyes again, mouthing, Okay, okay, not needing her to pantomime further what she wants me to do. I hate the thought of leaving the clattering nerve center of the restaurant to wrestle with my trigonometry homework in my mother’s quiet office downstairs.\
 \
 (paragraph 2) “Order!”\
 \
 (paragraph 3) The bright lights and swirl of noise and motion are muffled as the kitchen door swings closed behind me.\
 \
 (paragraph 4) It’s hard to remember a time when the restaurant hasn’t been the center of our lives. Mom used to be a copy editor and wrote food features for our local paper, the Clarion, and she met Pia when she did a write-up on the culinary school Pia attended. Pia thinks it was fate that Mom wanted to invest in a restaurant at the same time Pia wanted to buy the old bank building.\
 \
 (paragraph 5) La Salle Rouge doesn’t serve much in the way of “kid” food, since the menu doesn’t cater to people my age on a cheap date, but I’ve loved everything about it from the first. I started experimenting with being a vegetarian when I turned fourteen, but Pia still found things to feed me and taught me to be creative with vegetables and tofu. I like to think I’m the best-fed vegetarian in the state of California.\
 \
 (paragraph 6) Pia’s been really good about teaching what she knows, and I decided early on that this is the work I want to do—get out of school and get into the kitchen for good. Mom and Pia have created a popular French-Asian-Californian fusion restaurant that has gotten great reviews from food critics. They took the best of each other’s tastes—Mom’s traditional Southern flavors and Pia’s French training combined with her vegetable- and spice-savvy Cambodian tastes—and pulled off what one food critic called “stylized food with unique flavor combinations in an intimate setting.”\
 \
 (paragraph 7) Whatever that means.\
 \
 (paragraph 8) Three years ago, when I started high school thirty pounds heavier than everyone in my class, Mom and I came up with a light menu for La Salle Rouge, and it’s been such a popular idea that Mom lets me come up with tasty, low-calorie desserts, which is one of my favorite things to do. It hardly seems fair that I have to walk away from all of that just to do trigonometry, but my mom says I have to finish school before I concentrate on cooking. She says it’s smarter to have a “backup plan,” and she’s made me apply to plenty of colleges and check out business majors just in case I ever want to do anything else with my life. I guess that makes sense if you’re anybody other than me. When I turn eighteen, I already know what I’m going to do.\
 \
 (paragraph 9) First, I’m going to buy a plane ticket to D.C. and go to Julia Child’s kitchen at the Smithsonian and leave roses. They don’t let you walk through it, but somewhere—I don’t know where—I’m going to leave a bouquet and a little note for her. Julia Child is my patron saint. (patron saint - an inspiring person admired for his or her work) She’s the queen of all reasons people can do anything they want in life. Saint Julia didn’t start cooking until she was practically forty, and she went on to do TV shows and make cookbooks and be this huge part of culinary history. She never got too fancy, she never freaked out, and she was never afraid to try new things. I want to be just like her—except maybe get famous faster.\
 \
 (paragraph 10) The second thing I’m going to do is buy myself a set of knives. Pia swears by this set of German steel knives she got when she graduated, but I’ve seen the TV chef Kylie Kwong use a phenomenal-looking ceramic knife on her show on the Discovery Channel. Either way, knives are what the best chefs have of their very own.\
 \
 (paragraph 11) The third thing I’m going to do, after I get back from Washington and get my knives, is . . . get discovered. Somehow. I know I’m going to have to pay my dues, but I’m so ready for my real life to start. It’s not something I admit to a lot, but my real dream is to be a celebrity chef. Do you know how many African American female chefs there aren’t? And how many vegetarian chefs have their own shows? The field is wide open for stardom. Every time I watch old episodes of Saint Julia, I imagine that I have my own cooking show. The way celebrity chefs do it now, I could also have a line of cooking gear, cookbooks, aprons, the works. People would know my name, ask for my autograph, and try my recipes. All I have to do is finish my trig homework and get back into the kitchen.\

Excerpt from One-Eyed Cat\
 by Paula Fox\
 \
 Ned loved snow, the whisper when he walked through it, a sound like candles being\
 blown out, the coming indoors out of it into the warmth, and standing on the register in\
 the big hall through which the dusty, metal-smelling heat blew up, and the going back out\
 again, shivering, cold, stooping and scooping up a handful to make a snowball, packing it\
 (line 5) hard with wet mittens, hefting it, tossing it as far as he could, and the runners of his sled\
 whispering across it as he sleighed down the slopes which were smooth and glittering and\
 hard, like great jewels.\
 On the first of December, there was a heavy snowfall. When Ned looked out of his\
 window the next morning, the river glowed like a snake made out of light as it wound\
 (line 10) among the snow-covered mountains.\
 He ate breakfast hastily, too preoccupied to read the story on the cereal box.\
 Mrs. Scallop (Mrs. Scallop: Ned’s family’s housekeeper) was broody this morning and left him a lone, her glance passing over him as\
 it passed over the kitchen chairs.\
 On the porch, he paused to take deep breaths of air which tasted, he imagined, like\
 (line 15) water from the center of the ocean, then he waded into the snow, passing the Packard (Packard: a brand of car that is no longer manufactured), its\
 windows white and hidden, the crabapple tree with its weighted branches, down the long\
 hill trying to guess if he was anywhere near the buried driveway. By the time he reached\
 Mr. Scully’s house, his galoshes were topped with snow and his feet were wet. Mr. Scully’s\
 shades were drawn; the house had a pinched look as though it felt the cold.\
 (line 20) Ned went around to the back until he could see the shed. There were boot tracks in\
 the snow leading to it and returning to the back door. He guessed the old man had taken\
 in the cat’s bowl; it was nowhere to be seen. You couldn’t leave anything out in this\
 weather, it would freeze. Mr. Scully had told him that finding water in the winter was a\
 big problem for animals. Licking the snow or ice could make them sick.\
 (line 25) Ned stared hard at the shed. Perhaps the cat was inside, squeezed in behind logs in a\
 tight space where its own breath would keep it warm. He was going to be late to school if\
 he didn’t get a move on, but he kept looking hard all over the yard as though he could\
 make the cat appear out of snow and gray sky. Twice, his glance passed over the icebox.\
 The third time, he saw that the motionless mound on top of it was not only the quilt but\
 (line 30) the cat, joined into one shape by a dusting of snow.\
 Ned held his breath for a moment, then put his own feet in Mr. Scully’s tracks and\
 went toward the shed. The tracks had frozen and they crunched under Ned’s weight, but\
 the cat didn’t raise its head. Ned halted a few feet away from it—but of course, he realized,\
 it wouldn’t hear him because of its deaf ear. He could have gone closer to it than he’d ever\
 (line 35) been but he had a sudden vision of the cat exploding into fear when it finally did\
 hear him.\
 When he got back to the front of the house, he saw fresh footsteps on the road. He\
 could tell it was the road because of the deep ditches which fell away to either side. He\
 guessed they were Billy’s tracks. It was odd to think that Billy, huffing and puffing, had\
 (line 40) gone past Mr. Scully’s place, thinking his own thoughts, while he, Ned, only a few yards\
 away, had been searching for the cat. He found Evelyn’s tracks, too, and later on, Janet’s,\
 the smallest of all. He felt ghostly as if he’d been left alone on a white, silent globe.\
 Somewhere in the evergreen woods, snow must have slid off a bough, for he heard the\
 loud plop, then the fainter sound of the bough springing up, relieved of the weight. He\
 (line 45) thought about the cat, visualizing how it had looked on the quilt. How still it had been!\
 Why hadn’t he gone right up to it, looked at it close, touched its fur? Why had it been so\
 motionless—still as death, still as a dead vole he’d seen last summer in the grass near the\
 well? He came to the snow-covered blacktop road upon which a few cars had left their\
 ridged tire tracks. He had a strong impulse to turn back, to play hooky for the first time in\
 (line 50) his life. Mr. Scully, with his poor eyesight, might not spot the cat on top of the icebox,\
 might not, then, set food out for it. Fretting and shivering, his feet numb, Ned went on\
 to school.\
 He tried very hard to concentrate on his lessons, to watch Miss Jefferson’s plump, even\
 handwriting on the blackboard as she wrote out the lines from a poem by Thomas Gray\
 (line 55) that the class was to memorize that week, but try as he might, the image of the unmoving\
 animal on the ragged old quilt persisted. Last week, on a rainy afternoon, the cat had\
 looked at Ned, had cocked its head as though to see him better. Its one eye, narrowed, had\
 reminded him of a grain of wheat.\
 “The curfew tolls the knell of parting day,\
 (line 60) The lowing herd wind slowly o’er the lea . . .”\
 Ned read the lines several times before copying them down in his copybook. The\
 words made no sense to him. It was this that had made his hours in school so hard ever\
 since he and Mr. Scully had seen the cat last autumn, this drawing away of his attention\
 from everything that was going on around him. He was either relieved because the cat was\
 (line 65) where he could see it or fearful because he didn’t know where it was.\
Ned’s decision to leave the cat causes\
(A) the cat to become more afraid\
 (B) Ned to be left behind by the other children\
 (C) the cat to go hungry for the rest of the day\
 (D) Ned to be distracted from his work during school\

Reading Comprehension Passage A\
 \
 The factory made the best centrifugal pumps in the world, and Merle Waggoner owned\
 it. He’d started it. He’d just been offered two million dollars for it by the General Forge and\
 Foundry Company. He didn’t have any stockholders and he didn’t owe a dime. He was\
 fifty-one, a widower, and he had one heir—a son. The boy’s name was Franklin. The boy\
 (line 5) was named after Benjamin Franklin.\
 \
 One Friday afternoon father and son came out of Merle’s office and into the factory.\
 They went down a factory aisle to Rudy Linberg’s lathe. (lathe — a machine on which a piece of material, such as wood or metal, is spun and shaped against a fixed\
 cutting tool)\
 \
 “Rudy,” said Merle, “the boy here’s home from college for three days, and I thought\
 maybe you and him and your boy and me might go out to the farm and shoot some clay\
 (line 10) pigeons tomorrow.”\
 \
 Rudy turned his sky-blue eyes to Merle and young Franklin. He was Merle’s age, and\
 he had the deep and narrow dignity of a man who had learned his limitations early—who\
 had never tried to go beyond them. His limitations were those of his tools, his flute and his\
 shotgun. …\
 \
 (line 15) “Let’s go ask my boy what he’s got on tomorrow,” said Rudy. It was a formality. Karl\
 always did what his father wanted him to do—did it with profound love. …\
 \
 Karl was a carbon copy of his father. He was such a good mimic of Rudy that his joints\
 seemed to ache a little with age. He seemed sobered by fifty-one years of life, though he’d\
 lived only twenty. He seemed instinctively wary of safety hazards that had been eliminated\
 (line 20) from the factory by the time he’d learned to walk. Karl stood at attention without humility,\
 just as his father had done.\
 \
 “Want to go shooting tomorrow?” said Rudy.\
 “Shoot what?” said Karl.\
 “Crows. Clay pigeons,” said Rudy. “Maybe a woodchuck.”\
 \
 (line 25)“Don’t mind,” said Karl. He nodded briefly to Merle and Franklin. “Glad to.” …\
 Rudy nodded. He examined the work in Karl’s lathe and tapped his own temple. The\
 tapping was a signal that Franklin had seen many times on hunts. It meant that Karl was\
 doing fine.\
 \
 Rudy touched Karl’s elbow lightly. It was the signal for Karl to get back to work. Rudy\
 (line 30) and Karl each held up a crooked finger and saluted with it. Franklin knew what that meant\
 too. It meant, “Good-by, I love you.” …\
 \
 Merle was sitting at his desk, his head down, when Franklin came in. He held a steel\
 plate about six inches square in his left hand. In the middle of the plate was a hole two inches\
 square. In his right hand he held a steel cube that fitted the hole exactly. …\
 \
 (line 35) Franklin sat down gingerly on a hard chair by the wall. The office hadn’t changed much\
 in the years he’d known it. It was one more factory room, with naked pipes overhead—the\
 cold ones sweaty, the hot ones dry. Wires snaked from steel box to steel box. The green walls\
 and cream trim were as rough as elephant hide in some places, with alternating coats of\
 paint and grime, paint and grime.\
 \
 (line 40) There had never been time to scrape away the layers, and barely enough time,\
 overnight, to slap on new paint. And there had never been time in which to finish the rough\
 shelves that lined the room. …\
 \
 Merle slipped the cube through the square hole once more. “Know what these are?” he\
 said.\
 \
 (line 45) “Yes, sir,” said Franklin. “They’re what Rudy Linberg had to make when he was an\
 apprentice in Sweden.”\
 The cube could be slipped through the hole in twenty-four different ways, without\
 letting the tiniest ray of light pass through with it.\
 \
 “Unbelievable skill,” said Franklin respectfully. “There aren’t craftsmen like that\
 (line 50) coming along any more.” He didn’t really feel much respect. He was simply saying what he\
 knew his father wanted to hear. The cube and the hole struck him as criminal wastes of time\
 and great bores. “Unbelievable,” he said again.\
 \
 “It’s utterly unbelievable, when you realize that Rudy didn’t make them,” said Merle\
 gravely, “when you realize what generation the man who made them belongs to.”\
 \
 (line 55) “Oh?” said Franklin. “Who did make them?”\
 \
 “Rudy’s boy, Karl,” said Merle. “A member of your generation.” He ground out his cigar\
 sadly. “He gave them to me on my last birthday. They were on my desk, boy, waiting for me\
 when I came in—right beside the ones Rudy gave me thirty-one years before.” …\
 \
 “I could have cried, boy, when I saw those two plates and those two cubes side by side,”\
 (line 60) said Merle. “Can you understand that?” he asked beseechingly. “Can you understand why\
 I’d feel like crying?” …\
 \
 “The cube of Karl’s fitted through the hole of Rudy’s!” said Merle. “They were\
 interchangeable!”\
 \
 “Gosh!” said Franklin. “I’ll be darned. Really?”\
 \
 (line 65) And now he felt like crying, because he didn’t care, couldn’t care—and would have\
 given his right arm to care. The factory whanged and banged and screeched in monstrous\
 irrelevance—Franklin’s, all Franklin’s, if he just said the word.\
 \
 “What’ll you do with it—buy a theater in New York?” said Merle abruptly.\
 \
 “Do with what, sir?” said Franklin.\
 \
 (line 70) “The money I’ll get for the factory when I sell it—the money I’ll leave to you when I’m\
 dead,” said Merle. He hit the word “dead” hard. “What’s Waggoner Pump going to be\
 converted into? Waggoner Theaters? Waggoner School of Acting? The Waggoner Home for\
 Broken-Down Actors?”\
 \
 “I—I hadn’t thought about it,” said Franklin. The idea of converting Waggoner Pump\
 (line 75) into something equally complicated hadn’t occurred to him, and appalled him now. He was\
 being asked to match his father’s passion for the factory with an equal passion for something\
 else. And Franklin had no such passion—for the theater or anything else. …\
 \
 “Don’t sell on my account,” said Franklin wretchedly.\
 \
 “On whose account would I keep it?” said Merle.\
 \
 (line 80) “Do you have to sell it today?” said Franklin, horrified.\
 \
 “Strike while the iron’s hot, I always say,” said Merle. “Today’s the day you decided to\
 be an actor, and, as luck would have it, we have an excellent offer for what I did with my\
 life.”\
 \
 “Couldn’t we wait?”\
 \
 (line 85) “For what?” said Merle. He was having a good time now.\
 \
 “Father!” cried Franklin. “For the love of heaven, father, please!” He hung his head and\
 shook it. “I don’t know what I’m doing,” he said brokenly. “I don’t know for sure what I want\
 to do yet. I’m just playing with ideas, trying to find myself. Please, father, don’t sell what\
 you’ve done with your life, don’t just throw it away because I’m not sure I want to do that\
 (line 90) with my life too! Please!” Franklin looked up. “I’m not Karl Linberg,” he said. “I can’t help\
 it. I’m sorry, but I’m not Karl Linberg.” …\

Excerpt from Gregor and the Sheep\
 by Toby Rosenstrauch\
 \
 (paragraph 1) In a valley in the highlands of Scotland, there once lived a young tenant farmer, Gregor, and his widowed mother. Although they worked hard, they could never accumulate enough money to buy the flock of sheep they longed to have, for their small parcel of land produced only modest amounts of oats and barley. To make matters worse, MacTavish, the owner of this and many other crofts, always found reasons not to pay the farmers all they had earned. . . .\
 \
 crofts = small farms\
 \
 (paragraph 2) When he opened the door each morning and looked out, he saw MacTavish’s house on top of a mountain, a magnificent stone mansion surrounded by red, pink, and violet rhododendrons. Gregor often climbed the slope and stood outside the iron gates, wondering what fine furnishings and delicious foods lay within. Neighbors claimed that MacTavish owned many houses and even kept a chest of gems under his bed. As Gregor, his mother, and their neighbors grew gaunt and pale with hard work and not enough food, they railed against MacTavish, who had swindled all of them at one time or another.\
 \
 swindled = cheated or tricked\
 \
 (paragraph 3) One day, as Gregor listened to the bagpipe music that drifted from the open windows of MacTavish’s mansion, he had an idea. That night, when his mother was asleep, he emptied the jug that held their money and counted it. After putting back a few coins for food, he put the rest in his pocket. The next morning, he hurried to the market, where he went from farmer to farmer, asking the prices of sheep for sale. Gregor found many handsome animals, but they were all too expensive. When he reached a stall with scrawny and sickly sheep, the owner beckoned to him. . . .\
 \
 (paragraph 4) Gregor shook his head and began to walk away. The man grabbed his sleeve and whispered in his ear, “This one will make her owner rich!” Gregor examined the old sheep with spindly legs and dirty, unkempt wool—the worst of the lot. “If she will make me rich,” said Gregor, “how is it that she has not done so for you?”\
 \
 (paragraph 5) The man paused, thinking. “I have not had her long enough!”\
 \
 (paragraph 6) “Nonsense,” said Gregor, but he gave the man his money and led the pitiful animal home.\
 \
 (paragraph 7) When his mother saw what he had bought with their money, she burst into tears. “My foolish son, what have you done? Now we will starve, and no one will help us!”\
 \
 (paragraph 8) “Do as I say, Mother, and we will be rich. I promise.”\
 \
 (paragraph 9) She wanted to believe him. Wiping her eyes with her ragged sleeve, she asked what he wanted her to do.\
 \
 (paragraph 10) “Go to market and tell everyone that your son has a sheep that will make whoever owns her rich,” said Gregor. . . .\
 \
 (paragraph 11) One morning, a carriage arrived. Two servants opened the door and a stout, welldressed gentleman emerged. His Tartan kilt was made of the finest wool, his ascot was pure silk, and his shoes had silver buckles. On his fat fingers were eight gold rings, and his pomaded hair glistened in the sun. It was MacTavish!\
 \
 Tartan kilt = traditional clothing worn by Scottish Highlanders\
 \
 ascot = a type of necktie\
 \
 (paragraph 12) Gregor bowed as if to royalty. MacTavish looked at him sternly. “I have come to rid you of the unfortunate sheep that everyone is talking about,” said MacTavish, opening his sporran. “I can pay your price and I will have her, even though she has done nothing for you, I see.” MacTavish sneered at Gregor.\
 \
 sporran = a small bag worn at the waist for holding personal items\
 \
 (paragraph 13) Gregor hugged Dear One. “I will not sell her to you!”\
 \
 (paragraph 14) ”At that, MacTavish, whose servants were helping him into his carriage, turned and marched back. “I will pay anything,” he said. “Name the price.”\
 \
 (paragraph 15) Gregor was ready. “That,” he said, pointing up to the mansion above them. “I will have the dwelling and everything in it—furniture, utensils, even the chest of gems under your bed.”\
 \
 (paragraph 16) “Done,” said MacTavish.\
 \
 (paragraph 17) The next day, Gregor and his mother moved into the mansion that had once belonged to MacTavish, and MacTavish brought Dear One to the market so that all might see he could indeed own anything he wanted. Then MacTavish and the sheep rode away in his carriage to another of his houses in a valley beyond the mountains.\
 \
 (paragraph 18) After months had passed and the sheep had done nothing to increase MacTavish’s riches, he realized he had been swindled. Furious beyond speech, he returned to the mansion, but Gregor would not open the gates.\
 \
 (paragraph 19) “I have been cheated!” shouted MacTavish.\
 \
 (paragraph 20) “You have not been cheated,” said Gregor. “I was the owner of the sheep, and she has made me rich, hasn’t she?”\
 \
 (paragraph 21) “Yes, but . . . ,” sputtered MacTavish.\
 \
 (paragraph 22) “Then you got what you paid for.” Gregor turned and walked away.\
 \
 (paragraph 23) Soon afterward, Gregor sold the chest of gems and bought the huge flock of sheep he and his mother had always wanted. He shared the rest of his fortune with the other poor families of the valley who had been cheated by MacTavish.\
What does the phrase “marched back” in paragraph 14 suggest about MacTavish?\
(A) He is confused.\
 (B) He is worried.\
 (C) He is determined.\
 (D) He is excited.\

 “The Russell-Einstein Manifesto,” signed by a group of eleven intellectuals and scientists including Bertrand Russell and Albert Einstein, was written at the height of the Cold War.\
 \
 In the tragic situation which confronts humanity, we feel that scientists should\

 of weapons of mass destruction, and to discuss a resolution in the spirit of the appended\

 (line 5) We are speaking on this occasion, not as members of this or that nation, continent, or\
 creed, but as human beings, members of the species Man, whose continued existence is in\
 doubt. The world is full of conflicts; and, overshadowing all minor conflicts, the titanic\
 struggle between Communism and anti-Communism. …\

 We have to learn to think in a new way. We have to learn to ask ourselves, not what steps\

 such steps; the question we have to ask ourselves is: what steps can be taken to prevent a\
 military contest of which the issue must be disastrous to all parties? …\
 \
 No doubt in an H-bomb (H-bomb — hydrogen bomb) war great cities would be obliterated. But this is one of the\
 minor disasters that would have to be faced. If everybody in London, New York, and\
 (line 15) Moscow were exterminated, the world might, in the course of a few centuries, recover from\
 the blow. But we now know, especially since the Bikini test, (Bikini test — reference to an American test of a hydrogen bomb conducted at the Bikini Atoll in the Pacific Ocean on March 1st, 1954. The bomb sent radioactive debris across the globe) that nuclear bombs can\
 gradually spread destruction over a very much wider area than had been supposed. …\
 \
 Many warnings have been uttered by eminent men of science and by authorities in\
 military strategy. None of them will say that the worst results are certain. What they do say\
 (line 20) is that these results are possible, and no one can be sure that they will not be realized. We\
 have not yet found that the views of experts on this question depend in any degree upon\
 their politics or prejudices. They depend only, so far as our researches have revealed, upon\
 the extent of the particular expert’s knowledge. We have found that the men who know most\
 are the most gloomy.\
 \
 (line 25) Here, then, is the problem which we present to you, stark and dreadful and inescapable:\
 Shall we put an end to the human race; or shall mankind renounce war? People will not face\
 this alternative because it is so difficult to abolish war.\
 \
 The abolition of war will demand distasteful limitations of national sovereignty. But\
 what perhaps impedes understanding of the situation more than anything else is that the\
 (line 30) term “mankind” feels vague and abstract. People scarcely realize in imagination that the\
 danger is to themselves and their children and their grandchildren, and not only to a dimly\
 apprehended humanity. They can scarcely bring themselves to grasp that they, individually,\
 and those whom they love are in imminent (imminent — about to take place) danger of perishing agonizingly. And so they\
 hope that perhaps war may be allowed to continue provided modern weapons are\
 (line 35) prohibited.\
 \
 This hope is illusory. Whatever agreements not to use H-bombs had been reached in\
 time of peace, they would no longer be considered binding in time of war, and both sides\
 would set to work to manufacture H-bombs as soon as war broke out, for, if one side\
 manufactured the bombs and the other did not, the side that manufactured them would\
 (line 40) inevitably be victorious.\
 \
 Although an agreement to renounce nuclear weapons as part of a general reduction of\
 armaments would not afford an ultimate solution, it would serve certain important purposes.\
 First: any agreement between East and West is to the good in so far as it tends to diminish\
 tension. Second: the abolition of thermo-nuclear weapons, if each side believed that the\
 (line 45) other had carried it out sincerely, would lessen the fear of a sudden attack in the style of\
 Pearl Harbour, which at present keeps both sides in a state of nervous apprehension. We\
 should, therefore, welcome such an agreement, though only as a first step.\
 \
 Most of us are not neutral in feeling, but, as human beings, we have to remember that,\
 if the issues between East and West are to be decided in any manner that can give any\
 (line 50) possible satisfaction to anybody, whether Communist or anti-Communist, whether Asian or\
 European or American, whether White or Black, then these issues must not be decided by\
 war. We should wish this to be understood, both in the East and in the West.\
 \
 There lies before us, if we choose, continual progress in happiness, knowledge, and\
 wisdom. Shall we, instead, choose death, because we cannot forget our quarrels? We\
 (line 55) appeal, as human beings, to human beings: Remember your humanity, and forget the rest.\
 If you can do so, the way lies open to a new Paradise; if you cannot, there lies before you\
 the risk of universal death.\
 \
 Resolution\
 \
 We invite this Congress, (Congress — the group of scientists who signed the Manifesto) and through it the scientists of the world and the general\
 public, to subscribe to the following resolution:\
 \
 (line 60) “In view of the fact that in any future world war nuclear weapons will certainly be\
 employed, and that such weapons threaten the continued existence of mankind, we urge\
 the Governments of the world to realize, and to acknowledge publicly, that their\
 purpose cannot be furthered by a world war, and we urge them, consequently, to find\
 peaceful means for the settlement of all matters of dispute between them.”\

The genius of apartheid was convincing people who were the overwhelming majority to turn on each other. Apart hate, is what it was. You separate people into groups and make them hate one another so you can run them all.\
 \
 At the time, black South Africans outnumbered white South Africans nearly five to one, yet we were divided into different tribes with different languages: Zulu, Xhosa, Tswana, Sotho, Venda, Ndebele, Tsonga, Pedi, and more. Long before apartheid existed these tribal factions clashed and warred with one another. Then white rule used that animosity [hatred] to divide and conquer. All nonwhites were systematically classified into various groups and subgroups. Then these groups were given differing levels of rights and privileges in order to keep them at odds. . . .\

Reading Comprehension Passage C\
 \
 Get That Song Outta My Head!\
 \
    The nightmare began when my husband walked into our kitchen and said, “I’ve had this\
 song stuck in my head all day …”\
    No! I thought. Don’t say it!\
    “Remember that song from the original Karate Kid movie?” he continued.\
 (line 5)   For the love of God, no!\
    “You know how it goes. ‘You’re the best around … na na na na na, na na na na. You’re\
 the best around …”\
    It was too late. Now I had an earworm — a song, melody or jingle that gets stuck in your\
 head.\
 (line 10)   The worst part? I only knew that same line. I walked around humming it for days. I tried\
 to shake it by singing along with tunes playing on my car radio while I was out running\
 errands. For a brief time, Van Halen’s “Runnin’ With the Devil” replaced it.\
    But in no time at all, that one line from “You’re the Best,” sung by Joe Esposito on the\
 The Karate Kid soundtrack, was back.\
 (line 15)   Perhaps if I heard more of the song in my head, it wouldn’t be as annoying. But just this\
 one line? Over and over and over again? It was pure torture. I needed to do something\
 drastic. I busted out that 1980s hit, “The Safety Dance” by Men Without Hats. After singing\
 it a few times, the earworm was gone.\
    I knew I’d get another one, though. About 90 percent of people experience earworms\
 (line 20) at least once a week, according to the Earworm Project run by the Music, Mind and Brain\
 group at Goldsmiths, University of London.\
    “Music lovers, specifically people who ascribe (ascribe - credit) more importance to music or people\
 who spend more time listening to music, have more frequent and longer earworm\
 episodes,” says Kelly Jakubowski, a researcher with the Earworm Project. …\
 (line 25)   To find out what causes earworms and how to get rid of them, I contacted the man\
 known as “Dr. Earworm,” James Kellaris, a marketing professor at the University of\
 Cincinnati. Certainly with a nickname like that, he would know something.\
    Kellaris began studying earworms in 1999. A former professional musician prone to\
 getting earworms himself, he eventually became a marketing professor “interested in how\
 (line 30) marketers use music to achieve various commercial goals,” he says. “It was a perfect storm\
 to create an earworms researcher.”\
    He explained to me that when we get an earworm, the tune seems to repeat itself\
 involuntarily, which is why experts consider earworms involuntary musical imagery (INMI).\
 This was exactly what “You’re the Best” had done to me.\
 (line 35)   So what, precisely, was happening in my brain when I couldn’t shake that tune?\
 Jakubowski contributed to a May 2015 study led by Nicolas Farrugia, a postdoctoral\
 researcher with the Earworm Project, that demonstrated auditory and inhibitory-related\
 areas play a role in earworms as well.\
    The researchers examined 44 healthy subjects, all between 25 and 70 years old and all\
 (line 40) participants of a past neuroimaging study run by the Cambridge Medical Research\
 Council’s Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit. These subjects took an online survey that\
 measured both the extent of their musical training and how strongly INMIs impacted them.\
 For example, the survey wanted to know how strong of a negative impact INMIs had on\
 them or if INMIs were actually helpful while they went about their everyday activities.\
 (line 45)   When they examined these participants’ brain images, one pattern in particular stuck\
 out: People who got earworms more often had a thinner right frontal cortex, which is\
 involved in inhibition, (inhibition -restraining behavior) and a thinner temporal cortex, which processes sensory stimuli like\
 sound. In other words, these people’s brains just weren’t as good at suppressing the random\
 song that might pop into their heads.\
 (line 50)   Why we get earworms, unfortunately, remains a scientific mystery. “We know that songs\
 that are ‘catchy’ — short, simple, repetitive and contain some incongruity — are most likely\
 to get stuck,” Kellaris says. Most people are more likely to get a song like “Don’t Worry, Be\
 Happy” stuck in their heads than, say, a Mahler symphony. And some things exacerbate\
 them: frequency and duration of exposure to music, worry, stress, fatigue and idleness.\
 (line 55)   Considering that my husband kept singing the snippet (snippet - short piece) while I was tired and stressed,\
 I can see why it got stuck. But my earworms have been relatively innocuous. (innocuous - harmless) Even though\
 they’re annoying, I can eventually get rid of them. Some people can’t, though.\
    Part of Kellaris’ earliest research involved mailing a questionnaire to about 1,000\
 respondents at four U.S. universities. He asked them if they’d ever had an earworm, for how\
 (line 60) long, how often it happened, how it made them feel, etc.\
    One respondent claimed to have had a song stuck in his head since 1978. This is known\
 as intrusive musical imagery (IMI), a musical obsession that’s chronic and highly distracting\
 to a person’s everyday life and work. According to Dean McKay, a psychology professor at\
 Fordham University, my short-lived earworm was nothing compared to an IMI.\
 (line 65)   But now I was concerned. Could my future earworms turn into these IMIs? Is there a\
 way to prevent this from happening?\
    McKay co-authored a June 2014 study titled “Musical obsessions: A comprehensive\
 review of neglected clinical phenomena.” For this study, McKay and other international\
 colleagues, all of whom treat obsessive-compulsive disorder, created the first\
 (line 70) comprehensive review of musical obsessions. They compiled a database of 96 case study\
 descriptions of people with severe musical obsessions — the largest compilation (compilation - collection) assembled\
 on this topic. They determined the characteristics of musical obsessions such as IMIs and\
 compared them with earworms, musical hallucinations and visual obsessional imagery.\
    The group’s research showed that IMIs can be treated by using a method known as\
 (line 75) distraction — coming up with a competing melody to think about that would get rid of the\
 IMI. That’s exactly what I had done, albeit unknowingly, when I used “The Safety Dance”\
 to stop my earworm.\
    McKay says my earworm was pesky because I knew only that one part of the song. He\
 suggests if I have just a portion of a song looping in my brain in the future, I can try another\
 (line 80) method called exposure — simply listening to the entire song. “It’s like a completion task,”\
 he says. “Once you know the whole song, then there’s no need for it to be stuck in your\
 head.”\
    Another form of distraction is to sing the song out loud, but change some of the words\
 or slightly throw off the melody. One of McKay’s patients had an IMI based on a Taylor\
 (line 85) Swift song. “We made up some other words for it,” he explains. “We messed up the melody\
 a bit, but not so much that it wasn’t recognizable as still being that song, and then it faded.”\
 McKay stresses that this is the only case he’s tried this in, so it’s not a forgone conclusion\
 this kind of distraction would work in other instances.\
    What I wanted to know was if the earworm I get today could become the IMI of\
 (line 90) tomorrow.\
    “Highly improbable,” he says.\
    “You’re the best,” I reply.\
    Oh no.\

The First Public Park\
 by Marcia Amidon Lusted\
 \
 It was just an idea for more than a decade, but by 1857, New Yorkers were serious\
 about building a grand public park. New York was the largest metropolis in the nation,\
 and its citizens wanted to show the world that Americans were not just concerned about\
 industry, wealth, and materialism but that they also appreciated natural landscapes.\
 (line 5) Using eminent domain, the city took more than 840 acres of land in the center of\
 Manhattan for the new park. The area was considered to lack any real estate value—it\
 included swamps, bluffs, and rock outcroppings as well as two reservoirs that supplied city\
 water. It was home to about 1,600 poor residents, however. This population of pig farmers,\
 gardeners, and an African American settlement called Seneca Village was displaced by the\
 (line 10) park’s construction.\
 The Central Park Commission held a competition to choose someone to design the\
 park. Among the professional and amateur designers who entered the contest was a team\
 consisting of an American agriculturalist and a British-born architect: Frederick Law\
 Olmsted and Calvert Vaux.\
 (line 15) It was Vaux’s idea for the two men to join forces. A talented draftsman, Vaux used his\
 detailed drawings to show how their idea for the park would look. An accomplished\
 writer, Olmsted wrote the report that described their plan and included lists of proposed\
 plants and an estimated budget. They submitted their plan, called “Greensward,” a day\
 after the commission’s deadline.\
 (line 20) Greensward included pastoral views and rolling meadows, just like those in traditional\
 English parks. The plan offered beautiful vistas of green lawns and natural rocky ridges as\
 well as more formal locations for public gatherings.\
 It also included four roads that cut through the park to carry carriage traffic from one\
 side to the other. Olmsted and Vaux designed these major thoroughfares to run eight feet\
 (line 25) below the park’s surface so they would not disrupt the park’s views and rural feeling.\
 Pedestrian paths, equestrian roads, and carriage drives were all kept separate from one\
 another. Vaux designed more than 40 bridges so that these various paths would never have\
 to cross on the same level.\
 Unlike some of the other submissions that included grand, elaborate buildings,\
 (line 30) Olmsted and Vaux kept structures to a minimum, with only four in the original plan. The\
 design and materials for the buildings were also specifically selected to blend in with the\
 natural environment.\
 Greensward was announced the winner in the spring of 1858. The selection committee\
 debated over certain design points—some of the members wanted a wide grand avenue in\
 (line 35) the park, similar to those found in European parks. Olmsted argued against it by saying\
 that stately roads would “destroy scenery at great cost” and that “straight lines of trees or\
 stately architecture . . . belong not to parks for the people but to palatial gardens.” Olmsted\
 and Vaux had created their design for the recreation of all people, not just the wealthy.\
 The park was to be a place where all New Yorkers could enjoy nature. Its ultimate design\
 (line 40) would retain this feeling.\
 The construction of Central Park was one of the most massive public works projects\
 to take place in 19th-century New York. It required about 20,000 workers to reshape the\
 natural features of the land according to Olmsted and Vaux’s plan. Three hundred\
 thousand cubic yards of rock were blasted into rubble, and the resulting stone was crushed\
 (line 45) to use as paving material. Nearly three million cubic yards of soil were moved, and more\
 than 270,000 trees and shrubs were planted. Swamps were transformed into scenic lakes,\
 and extensive drainage work was done to get rid of small streams and pools. By 1866,\
 more than $5 million had been spent on construction. The park’s final price tag was more\
 than $10 million. In the end, this entirely planned park, stretching from 59th Street to\
 (line 50) 110th Street and from Fifth to Eighth avenues, had a completely natural, unplanned\
 feeling to it.\
 The process of overseeing the park’s construction and accounting for its expenditures\
 exhausted Olmsted. He required a six-week rest cure in Europe in 1859 and suffered a\
 severe broken leg in 1860 that laid him up, but he had the plans for the park spread out in\
 (line 55) his bedroom so he could continue to work. When he tried to resign from the project in\
 1861, however, the commission knew that it could not afford to lose him. Ultimately,\
 Olmsted’s duties and responsibilities were decreased, and when he departed the project to\
 serve in the U.S. Sanitary Commission during the Civil War (1861–1865), the park’s\
 construction was completed under park commission president Andrew Green and Vaux.\
 (line 60) Olmsted’s involvement in Central Park spanned nearly 20 years. It was not the only\
 site he worked or consulted on, and, for a couple of years, other projects demanded his\
 full attention. But from the time their plan was selected until the mid-1870s, Olmsted and\
 Vaux were associated with the park on and off. Sometimes, their titles as landscape\
 architect advisors required little on-site work. At other times, such as when Olmsted filled\
 (line 65) in as acting president of the Department of Public Parks, he looked into establishing lights\
 in the park at night and assessing the park’s safety. By 1878, however, Olmsted’s role with\
 the park officially ended.\
 Today, Central Park stands as one of Olmsted’s greatest legacies. It contains numerous\
 playgrounds and athletic fields. Runners and bicyclists make use of the wide, rolling paths.\
 (line 70) There are places to skate in the winter and boat in the summer. Concerts, plays, and rallies\
 take place there. Sculptures by famous artists can be found throughout the park. There are\
 also quiet places to walk, sit and read a book, or watch birds. Central Park has become a\
 world-famous site that attracts more than 25 million visitors each year. It also is a shining\
 example of Olmsted’s desire to create and preserve public green spaces in urban places for\
 (line 75) generations of people to enjoy.\
Which evidence supports the claim that Americans “appreciated natural landscapes” (line 4)?\
(A) “The area was considered to lack any real estate value—it included swamps, bluffs, and rock outcroppings as well as two reservoirs that supplied city water.” (lines 6 through 8)\
 (B) “Vaux designed more than 40 bridges so that these various paths would never have to cross on the same level.” (lines 27 and 28)\
 (C) “The construction of Central Park was one of the most massive public works projects to take place in 19th-century New York.” (lines 41 and 42)\
 (D) “There are also quiet places to walk, sit and read a book, or watch birds.” (lines 71 and 72)\

Excerpt from Humans With Amazing Senses\
 \
 When bats go out to hunt, they send out sonar signals at such high frequencies and in\
 such rapid bursts that they can hear the signals bounce off mosquitoes in midair. They\
 then zero in on the insects like laser-guided missiles. Dolphins use the same technique to\
 find their dinners. It’s called echolocation, a technique that uses sound to identify objects\
 (line 5) by the echoes they produce.\
 Fourteen-year-old Ben Underwood of Sacramento, Calif., is one of the few people\
 known to use echolocation as a primary means of navigating the world on land. There’s\
 not even a hint of light reaching his brain. His eyes are artificial, but his brain has adapted\
 to allow him to appraise his environment. He makes a “clicking” sound to communicate\
 (line 10) with objects and people around him.\
 Scientists have discovered that in the brains of the blind, the visual cortex has not\
 become useless, as they once believed. When blind people use another sense—touch or\
 hearing, for example—to substitute for sight, the brain’s visual cortex becomes active, even\
 though no images reach it from the optic nerve. Echolocation creates its own images.\
 (line 15) “I can hear that wall behind you over there. I can hear right there—the radio, and the\
 fan,” Ben says.\
 Ben says every object in his life talks to him in ways that no one else can hear\
 or understand.\
 Forty-year-old Daniel Kish of Long Beach, Calif., also uses echolocation, and has\
 (line 20) become an expert on it, founding the World Access for the Blind, an organization that\
 teaches others how to echolocate. Kish leads other blind people on mountain biking tours\
 and hikes in the wilderness, visualizing and describing the picturesque sights around him\
 through echolocating.\
 Clicking to Do Anything\
 If you listen closely to Ben or Kish, you can hear how they find their way. Ben says he\
 (line 25) can distinguish where the curbs are as he cruises his neighborhood streets.\
 He can find the pole and the backboard on a basketball goal, and tell which is which\
 by the distinctive echo each makes. Even though he can’t see the goal he’s aiming for, he\
 can sink a basket. Ben doesn’t remember how or when he began clicking, but he’s\
 developed his abilities to such an extent that aside from echolocation, he can rapidly\
 (line 30) discriminate the sounds in video games.\
 Ben lost his sight when he was 2. He was diagnosed with cancer in both eyes, and\
 when chemotherapy failed, his mother, Aquanetta Gordon, was left with one option: For\
 her son to live, both his eyes had to be surgically removed.\
 Gordon remembers her son after the operation.\
 (line 35) “He woke up and he said, ‘Mom, I can’t see anymore, I can’t see anymore.’ And I took\
 his hands and I put them on my face and I said, ‘Baby, yes, you can see.’ I said, ‘You can\
 see with your hands.’ And then I put my hand on his nose and I said, ‘You smell me? You\
 can see with your nose and your ears. . . . You can’t use your eyes anymore, but you have\
 your hands and your nose and your ears.’ ”\
 (line 40) In a house already filled with three other children, Ben’s mother decided not to treat\
 his blindness as a handicap. In school, Ben recognizes his classmates by their voices. With\
 the help of Braille books and a talking laptop computer, Ben attends the same classes as\
 sighted students.\
 Rich Mental Images, Without Visual Elements\
 Like Ben, Kish also lost his eyesight to cancer at age 1. He was raised to believe he\
 (line 45) could do pretty much anything, and he discovered clicking by accident as a child.\
 “I have mental images that are very rich, very complex. They simply do not possess\
 the visual element,” Kish says.\
 In retrieving those pictures, Kish varies the pace and volume of his clicks as he\
 walks along; and what he can tell you about an object’s qualities is sometimes\
 (line 50) astonishingly thorough.\
 If bats can distinguish prey as small as mosquitoes with echolocation, and some\
 dolphins can detect small targets a hundred yards away, what are the ultimate capabilities\
 of human beings like Ben and Kish?\
 Peter Scheifele, who studies hearing and sound production in animals and people at\
 (line 55) the University of Connecticut, analyzed samples of the clicks that Ben and Kish make.\
 “Ben clicks, looks to me like once every half second, whereas a dolphin is actually\
 making 900 clicks per second. And the bat is even faster than that,” Scheifele says.\
 The bottom line: Human beings send out sounds at much slower rates and lower\
 frequencies, so the objects people can picture with echolocation must be much larger than\
 (line 60) the ones bats and dolphins can find.\
How do lines 51 through 53 develop a key concept of the article?\
(A) by using a comparison to suggest the echolocation potential of humans\
 (B) by demonstrating that humans use echolocation more effectively than animals do\
 (C) by describing why using echolocation benefits bats and dolphins in unique ways\
 (D) by showing that scientists need more time to study echolocation techniques\

This excerpt is from a book about the history of the Hudson River.\
 \
 Excerpt from River of Dreams\
 by Hudson Talbott\
 \
 (paragraph 1) By the twentieth century, New York City had long since reached its destiny of\
 becoming the most powerful city in America. In less than 300 years it had grown from\
 a tiny Dutch outpost in the wilderness to the business capital of the world. It was a city\
 built on dreams.\
 (paragraph 2) But it was made out of bricks and cement that had come from the banks of the\
 Hudson. The river which had fed all those dreams was now fading into the background.\
 New York didn’t seem to need the river anymore, except as a sewer. And that’s what it\
 became.\
 (paragraph 3) Industry on the river had made some New Yorkers filthy rich. But it had just made\
 the river filthy. Garbage, factory waste, plant chemicals and the raw sewage of the cities\
 and towns along its banks were dumped directly into the river. The water turned\
 greenish brown, except by the GM plant, where it turned red or yellow or whatever\
 color they were painting the cars that day.\
 (paragraph 4) The fishing industry collapsed. The few fish that survived were too poisonous to eat.\
 Smog from the factory smoke and dust from the cement plants blanketed the valley.\
 And it was all legal.\
 (paragraph 5) Most people don’t start out with dreams of polluting a river. But it was often the\
 result of people chasing their dreams of wealth with little care of how they reached it.\
 The Hudson Valley had always drawn them.\
 (paragraph 6) But now there were other dreamers in the valley, with their own dreams of wealth.\
 They dreamed of the wealth of wildlife in a healthy forest, the abundance of fish in\
 oxygen-rich water, and the great fortune of living in a beautiful river valley.\
 (paragraph 7) So perhaps it was a matter of time before the two types of dreamers would meet each\
 other—in court.\
 (paragraph 8) In 1963, Con Edison, New York City’s power company, proposed a plan for\
 constructing the largest hydroelectric pumping station ever built. The plan called for\
 carving out a gigantic hole in the side of majestic Storm King Mountain on the Hudson\
 River.\
 (paragraph 9) But then they met Franny Reese. Franny was a longtime valley resident with a simple\
 point to make: the mountain could not speak for itself. If she didn’t speak for it, who\
 would?\
 (paragraph 10) Franny and a group of like-minded people founded Scenic Hudson and took on the\
 power company in a landmark court case. Con Ed challenged the right of private\
 citizens to participate, but the court sided with the citizens, in the ruling now known as\
 the Scenic Hudson Decision.\
 (paragraph 11) After dragging out the case for seventeen years, Con Ed finally gave up and Storm\
 King survived unblemished. It was the beginning of the environmental movement in\
 this country, and once again, the Hudson Valley was the birthplace.\
 (paragraph 12) More and more people joined the movement as they realized how much difference\
 each of us can make.\
 (paragraph 13) The love of their land was still alive in the hearts of Americans, and now that it was\
 aroused again, things began to change.\
 (paragraph 14) Many new laws and new citizens’ groups have been inspired by those early heroes of\
 the environment, and their work has begun to bring the Hudson back to life.\
 (paragraph 15) The Mahicans called it “The River That Flows Both Ways.” Slowly we are learning\
 that taking care of the river is the only way that the river can take care of us.\
 (paragraph 16) Fifty years have passed since I dreamed of going to New York to see the river that\
 shares my name, and thirty-five years since that dream came true. I live in the Hudson\
 Valley now, grateful to all those who came before me, following their dreams to this\
 river, building this nation, sharing its beauty, securing its future.\
 (paragraph 17) It’s now my turn to help in keeping the river of dreams flowing, for all those\
 dreamers yet to come.\
Which sentence is most important to include in a summary of the article?\
(A) One company colored the river red and yellow with excess car paint.\
 (B) The Hudson River became polluted in the effort to gain wealth.\
 (C) The Mahicans have a saying about taking care of the river.\
 (D) The author has dreamed of returning to the Hudson River for fifty years.\

Reading Comprehension Passage C\
 \
 “The Russell-Einstein Manifesto,” signed by a group of eleven intellectuals and scientists including Bertrand Russell and Albert Einstein, was written at the height of the Cold War.\
 \
 In the tragic situation which confronts humanity, we feel that scientists should\
 assemble in conference to appraise the perils that have arisen as a result of the development\
 of weapons of mass destruction, and to discuss a resolution in the spirit of the appended\
 draft.\
 \
 (line 5) We are speaking on this occasion, not as members of this or that nation, continent, or\
 creed, but as human beings, members of the species Man, whose continued existence is in\
 doubt. The world is full of conflicts; and, overshadowing all minor conflicts, the titanic\
 struggle between Communism and anti-Communism. …\
 \
 We have to learn to think in a new way. We have to learn to ask ourselves, not what steps\
 (line 10) can be taken to give military victory to whatever group we prefer, for there no longer are\
 such steps; the question we have to ask ourselves is: what steps can be taken to prevent a\
 military contest of which the issue must be disastrous to all parties? …\
 \
 No doubt in an H-bomb (H-bomb — hydrogen bomb) war great cities would be obliterated. But this is one of the\
 minor disasters that would have to be faced. If everybody in London, New York, and\
 (line 15) Moscow were exterminated, the world might, in the course of a few centuries, recover from\
 the blow. But we now know, especially since the Bikini test, (Bikini test — reference to an American test of a hydrogen bomb conducted at the Bikini Atoll in the Pacific Ocean on March 1st, 1954. The bomb sent radioactive debris across the globe) that nuclear bombs can\
 gradually spread destruction over a very much wider area than had been supposed. …\
 \
 Many warnings have been uttered by eminent men of science and by authorities in\
 military strategy. None of them will say that the worst results are certain. What they do say\
 (line 20) is that these results are possible, and no one can be sure that they will not be realized. We\
 have not yet found that the views of experts on this question depend in any degree upon\
 their politics or prejudices. They depend only, so far as our researches have revealed, upon\
 the extent of the particular expert’s knowledge. We have found that the men who know most\
 are the most gloomy.\
 \
 (line 25) Here, then, is the problem which we present to you, stark and dreadful and inescapable:\
 Shall we put an end to the human race; or shall mankind renounce war? People will not face\
 this alternative because it is so difficult to abolish war.\
 \
 The abolition of war will demand distasteful limitations of national sovereignty. But\
 what perhaps impedes understanding of the situation more than anything else is that the\
 (line 30) term “mankind” feels vague and abstract. People scarcely realize in imagination that the\
 danger is to themselves and their children and their grandchildren, and not only to a dimly\
 apprehended humanity. They can scarcely bring themselves to grasp that they, individually,\
 and those whom they love are in imminent (imminent — about to take place) danger of perishing agonizingly. And so they\
 hope that perhaps war may be allowed to continue provided modern weapons are\
 (line 35) prohibited.\
 \
 This hope is illusory. Whatever agreements not to use H-bombs had been reached in\
 time of peace, they would no longer be considered binding in time of war, and both sides\
 would set to work to manufacture H-bombs as soon as war broke out, for, if one side\
 manufactured the bombs and the other did not, the side that manufactured them would\
 (line 40) inevitably be victorious.\
 \
 Although an agreement to renounce nuclear weapons as part of a general reduction of\
 armaments would not afford an ultimate solution, it would serve certain important purposes.\
 First: any agreement between East and West is to the good in so far as it tends to diminish\
 tension. Second: the abolition of thermo-nuclear weapons, if each side believed that the\
 (line 45) other had carried it out sincerely, would lessen the fear of a sudden attack in the style of\
 Pearl Harbour, which at present keeps both sides in a state of nervous apprehension. We\
 should, therefore, welcome such an agreement, though only as a first step.\
 \
 Most of us are not neutral in feeling, but, as human beings, we have to remember that,\
 if the issues between East and West are to be decided in any manner that can give any\
 (line 50) possible satisfaction to anybody, whether Communist or anti-Communist, whether Asian or\
 European or American, whether White or Black, then these issues must not be decided by\
 war. We should wish this to be understood, both in the East and in the West.\
 \
 There lies before us, if we choose, continual progress in happiness, knowledge, and\
 wisdom. Shall we, instead, choose death, because we cannot forget our quarrels? We\
 (line 55) appeal, as human beings, to human beings: Remember your humanity, and forget the rest.\
 If you can do so, the way lies open to a new Paradise; if you cannot, there lies before you\
 the risk of universal death.\
 \
 Resolution\
 \
 We invite this Congress, (Congress — the group of scientists who signed the Manifesto) and through it the scientists of the world and the general\
 public, to subscribe to the following resolution:\
 \
 (line 60) “In view of the fact that in any future world war nuclear weapons will certainly be\
 employed, and that such weapons threaten the continued existence of mankind, we urge\
 the Governments of the world to realize, and to acknowledge publicly, that their\
 purpose cannot be furthered by a world war, and we urge them, consequently, to find\
 peaceful means for the settlement of all matters of dispute between them.”\

Alan is on a volcano on Titan, a moon of Saturn. As the story opens, Alan is stranded on its summit in his space crawler. Luckily, he has brought along his mechanical wings.\
 \
 Excerpt from Fly for Your Life\
 \
 by John Frizell\
 \
 (paragraph 1) Alan knew there was no way back to the base and no way the crew there could help him remotely—the other crawler was down for maintenance. He could go down this side of the stream for 23 kilometers, to a flat area where the flowing liquid would spread out and be shallow enough to cross; then go back 23 kilometers to the far side of the bridge. One problem: he would definitely run out of air before he got there.\
 \
 (paragraph 2) Then Alan thought of the folded flight wings he had attached to his suit. Could he fly across the river and then walk to the base? Some quick calculations showed it wouldn’t work. He had enough air, but the battery that powered the heater of the suit he wore to stay alive on Titan was only good for an hour, not the four-hour walk it would take to reach the base. Spacewalks were usually done trailing a power cable plugged in to the suit. The cable carried power from the crawler to supplement the suit’s battery. Without the supplemental power, he would freeze solid in 10 minutes once the battery was exhausted.\
 \
 (paragraph 3) Alan knew flying the whole way was impossible. Even with Titan’s thick atmosphere and low gravity the suit made flying hard work, worse than running uphill carrying a sack of cement. No one could stay aloft for more than 10 minutes. It would be at least a half-hour flight to the base.\
 \
 (paragraph 4) He needed more than wings alone to get back alive. Then it came to him. Bolted to the side of the crawler was a squat, black cylinder containing compressed nitrogen at 200 bar, compressed Titanian atmosphere in fact, used for cleaning gunk off the crawler’s treads. Alan struggled with the bolts, working carefully in the searing cold with tools as brittle as glass. When he had the cylinder off, propped up, and pointing at the sky, he put his wings on, and then took them off, repeating the task until he could do it without thinking about it. . . .\
 \
 (paragraph 5) He pulled the power cable out of his suit’s hip socket and, before he could change his mind, gave a sharp tug on a line that he had attached to the valve of the pressure cylinder. The cylinder hissed like a giant snake, as high-pressure nitrogen blasted out, and then shot into the sky. A length of climbing rope he had attached to it went taut and snatched him into the air, where he was buffeted and tossed by the jet of nitrogen pouring down on him. It was like being caught under a breaking wave, pounded again and again by the surf. He was directly under the cylinder, using his weight and drag to keep the nozzle pointed down as the cylinder lofted him into Titan’s sky. The ground beneath, blurred by the motion, made it impossible to gauge height or direction.\
 \
 (paragraph 6) Time slowed; his shuddering world narrowed to the readout of the Titan Positioning System (TPS)—the icy moon’s equivalent of GPS. Gradually, the pounding lessened as the rate of climb shown on the readout passed its peak and began falling. Alan waited. Just before it hit zero, he cut the rope. The cylinder, relieved of his drag, flew off, dwindling to a black dot and then disappearing into the empty sky above. Now he was coasting upward, propelled by the momentum imparted to him by the nitrogen rocket. He was high in the air, but already he was slowing under the drag of the thick atmosphere. He had to get the wings on before the downward fall began. Once he started to move with some speed, he would begin to spin and never get them on. The first wing stuck and he had to take his arm out of the loops and try again. . . .\
 \
 (paragraph 7) He was gathering speed on his way down before he got the second one on. He spread his wings and rolled into a comfortable position, soaring over the moon’s dimly lit surface. The TPS showed that he was heading away from the base. He banked in an easy curve and settled on a course for home. All he had to do was hold the wings rigid and enjoy the ride. He took an occasional flap, just for fun. . . .\
 \
 (paragraph 8) As Alan glided toward the base, he flapped more often, watching the height-abovesurface and distance-to-target displays. As they unwound, an unpleasant feeling, like a trace of the frigid atmosphere outside, crept into his stomach. His elevation was dropping dangerously, with over three kilometers left to go on distance-to-target. He could see details on the surface more clearly now, because he was flying so low. . . .\
 \
 (paragraph 9) Alan forced himself to stay calm. Panic would mean disaster. He started flapping his wings faster, faster, faster. . . . He could feel himself lifting with every beat of the massive appendages. Faster, faster, faster. . . . His descent rate began to slow, but the muscles in his arms burned with pain. . . .\
 \
 (paragraph 10) Time stretched out endlessly.\
 \
 (paragraph 11) The TPS buzzed loudly in his helmet. Target. the station’s beacon was directly below him. He could barely feel his arms, but something made them stop flapping. He gratefully fell out of the sky, wrapped in a ball of pain, with barely the strength to flare his wings one last time for a soft landing. . . .\
 \
 (paragraph 12) Then he saw someone running toward him with a power cable in hand. Voices boomed into his helmet. It sounded like the whole station was in the control room waiting to see if he had made it.\
 \
 (paragraph 13) “Alan! ALAN! Say something! Can you move? Are you receiving this?” He recognized the voice of the base leader. . . .\
 \
 (paragraph 14) As the crew lifted him carefully onto a stretcher, he looked up at Titan’s hazy sky. I flew for my life today, he thought. I survived. That’s the only record that matters.\

 gathering around a flame to eat and to commune with others is, in fact, what made us\
 human. Not just fellowship but safety has long been the primary rationale for pushing back\
 (line 15) the night. ‘Evil spirits love not the smell of lamps,’ as Plato put it. Comforting, lambent (lambent — glowing or flickering with a soft radiance) \
 lamplight led us safely home by tattling on the people and potholes and animals that would\
 otherwise do us harm. By the early 17th century, residents of cities such as Paris and London\
 were admonished (admonished — warned) to keep lights burning in the windows of all houses that faced the streets,\
 as the historian A. Roger Ekirch notes in his book At Day’s Close: Night in Times Past\
 (line 20) (2005). Taxpayers funded oil lamps and candlelit lanterns for the avenues, while only\
 genteel households could afford fine beeswax or spermaceti candles; most people relied on\
 tallow, made from animal fat. …\
 \
 And even so — what price safety! A young but rapidly growing field of research suggests\
 that night-time light itself is far more dangerous than the dark. In a 2012 report, an\
 (line 25) American Medical Association committee called electric lighting a ‘man-made self-\
 experiment’ creating potentially harmful health effects. Humans, and everything else that\
 lives on this planet with us, evolved during billions of years along a reliable cycle of day and\
 night, with clear boundaries between them. Staunching the flood of artificial light can help\
 restore this divide. Our well-being, and that of our fellow creatures, might depend on us\
 (line 30) doing so — or at the very least trying. The loss of night-time darkness neglects our shared\
 past, but it might very well cut short our futures too. …\
 \
 A growing body of evidence shows that light pollution exacerbates (exacerbates — makes a situation worse),  and might directly\
 cause, cancer, obesity, and depression, the troublesome triumvirate (triumvirate — a group of three holding power) of industrialised\
 society. One of the first people to notice this correlation, at least as it applies to cancer, is\
 (line 35) Richard Stevens, a professor at the University of Connecticut, respected cancer\
 epidemiologist (epidemiologist — health professional who investigates patterns and causes of diseases), and mild insomniac. In the early 1980s, Stevens and other researchers\
 were beginning to realise there was little or no connection between diet and rising rates \
 breast cancer, contrary to what had been suspected. As Stevens puts it, it was like a light\
 bulb going on when he realised that, in fact, a light bulb going on might be a culprit. …\
 \
 (line 40) ‘Rather than falling, night, to the watchful eye, rises,’ writes Ekirch in At Day’s Close.\
 Shadows creep up lows and valleys first, then consume hillsides and houses and the tallest\
 buildings. Muted greys and deeper blues chase off the sun until finally the sky leaks no\
 colour. When we sleep according to a solar cycle, melatonin (melantonin - hormone that regulates sleep and wakefulness) production follows this\
 pattern, rising with the night. But artificial light tamps it down. This is frustratingly\
 (line 45) apparent for a special class of humans who experience sunsets every 90 minutes: astronauts.\
 \
 One of the most frequent complaints of orbital crew members is insomnia; they pop\
 sleeping pills on a regular basis, and still get only about six hours of shuteye, though they’re\
 allotted eight. Steven W. Lockley, a Harvard neuroscientist, recommends altering the light\
 to improve matters. In 2012, he advised NASA [National Aeronautics and Space\
 (line 50) Administration] engineers to change the light bulbs on the International Space Station to a\
 type of LED that can display blue-shifted light during the ‘day’, when the crew is working,\
 and red-shifted light when they need to rest. Why the difference? That crucial ganglion (ganglion — mass of nerve tissues in the brain),\
 the circadian (circadian — 24-hour biological cycle) photoreceptor, is particularly sensitive to light toward the bluish end of the\
 red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo and violet visible-light spectrum. …\
 \
 (line 55) Insomnia is hardly the worst side effect of light pollution. Shift workers, who rise with\
 the night and work awash in blue light, experience not only disrupted circadian rhythms and\
 sleep deprivation, but an increased risk of breast and prostate cancer. These cancers, which\
 require hormones to grow, are suppressed in the presence of melatonin, Stevens has shown.\
 In 2010, Stevens published a review of breast cancer sensitivity in 164 countries, and found\
 (line 60) a 30 to 50 per cent increased risk of cancer in nations with the worst light pollution, but no\
 increased prevalence of non-hormonally dependent cancers in the same populations.\
 \
 ‘Our use of electric light in the modern world is disrupting our circadian sleep and our\
 biology. There is no question about that. Does that have physiological consequences? There\
 is more and more evidence that it does,’ Stevens told me. ‘The epidemiological studies are\
 (line 65) the crudest, but the most important.’ …\
 \
 When we, in the industrialised world, do manage to turn off the lights, there are\
 measurable, beneficial effects on our circadian rhythms. In a widely reported paper last\
 summer, Kenneth Wright at the University of Colorado at Boulder took eight students\
 camping in the Rocky Mountains for two weeks. They weren’t allowed to use any artificial\
 (line 70) light after the sun went down — only the sanguine (sanguine — red) glow of campfire. After a week,\
 melatonin started to rise at sunset, peak in the middle of the night, and taper just at sunrise,\
 which Wright called a ‘remarkable’ result. ‘Internal biological time under natural light-dark\
 conditions tightly synchronises to environmental time, and in this regard, humans are\
 comparable to other animals,’ he wrote. …\
 \
 (line 75) For those of us addicted to our glowing phones and tablets, an app called F.lux can help.\
 It ‘warms’ your device’s display screen so that it shifts red in the evening, more closely\
 matching incandescent bulbs and the hue of the setting sun. Just a brief glimpse at your\
 mobile phone at bedtime is enough to expose your retinas to artificial light, so fighting such\
 a comprehensive intrusion might be an exercise in futility. But even if we can’t completely\
 (line 80) quench our thirst for light, we can all make one small gesture, which could prompt us to\
 unplug a little more. …\

Excerpt from Snowflake Bentley\
 by Jacqueline Briggs Martin\
 \
 (paragraph 1) In the days when farmers worked with ox and sled and cut the dark with lantern light, there lived a boy who loved snow more than anything in the world. Willie Bentley’s happiest days were snowstorm days. He watched snowflakes on his mittens, on the dried grass of Vermont farm fields, on the dark metal handle of the barn door. He said snow was as beautiful as butterflies, or apple blossoms.\
 \
 (paragraph 2) He could net butterflies and show them to his older brother, Charlie. He could pick apple blossoms and take them to his mother. But he could not share snowflakes because he could not save them.\
 \
 (paragraph 3) When his mother gave him an old microscope, he used it to look at flowers, raindrops, and blades of grass. Best of all, he used it to look at snow. While other children built forts and pelted snowballs at roosting crows, Willie was catching snowflakes. Day after stormy day he studied the icy crystals.\
 \
 (paragraph 4) Their intricate patterns were even more beautiful than he had imagined. He expected to find whole flakes that were the same, that were copies of each other. But he never did. Willie decided he must find a way to save snowflakes so others could see their wonderful designs. For three winters he tried drawing snow crystals. They always melted before he could finish.\
 \
 (paragraph 5) When he was sixteen, Willie read of a camera with its own microscope. “If I had that camera I could photograph snowflakes,” he told his mother. Willie’s mother knew that he would not be happy until he could share what he had seen.\
 \
 (paragraph6) “Fussing with snow is just foolishness,” his father said. Still, he loved his son. When Willie was seventeen his parents spent their savings and bought the camera. It was taller than a newborn calf, and cost as much as his father’s herd of ten cows. Willie was sure it was the best of all cameras.\
 \
 (paragraph 7) Even so his first pictures were failures—no better than shadows. Yet he would not quit. Mistake by mistake, snowflake by snowflake, Willie worked through every storm. Winter ended, the snow melted, and he had no good pictures. He waited for another season of snow. One day, in the second winter, he tried a new experiment. And it\
 worked! Willie had figured out how to photograph snowflakes! “Now everyone can see the great beauty in a tiny crystal,” he said.\
 \
 (paragraph 8) But in those days, no one cared. Neighbors laughed at the idea of photographing snow. “Snow in Vermont is as common as dirt,” they said. “We don’t need pictures.” Willie said the photographs would be his gift to the world. While other farmers sat by the fire or rode to town with horse and sleigh, Willie studied snowstorms. He stood at the shed door and held out a black tray to catch the flakes.\
 \
 (paragraph 9) When he found only jumbled, broken crystals, he brushed the tray clean with a turkey feather and held it out again. He waited hours for just the right crystal and didn’t notice the cold. If the shed were warm the snow would melt. If he breathed on the black tray the snow would melt. If he twitched a muscle as he held the snow crystal on the long wood pick the snowflake would break. He had to work fast or the snowflake would evaporate before he could slide it into place and take its picture. Some winters he was able to make only a few dozen good pictures. Some winters he made hundreds. . . .\
 \
 (paragraph 10) But his snow crystal pictures were always his favorites. He gave copies away or sold them for a few cents. He made special pictures as gifts for birthdays. He held evening slide shows on the lawns of his friends. Children and adults sat on the grass and watched while Willie projected his slides onto a sheet hung over a clothesline.\
 \
 (paragraph 11) He wrote about snow and published his pictures in magazines. He gave speeches about snow to faraway scholars and neighborhood skywatchers. “You are doing great work,” said a professor from Wisconsin. The little farmer came to be known as the world’s expert on snow, “the Snowflake Man.” But he never grew rich. He spent every\
 penny on his pictures. Willie said there were treasures in snow. “I can’t afford to miss a single snowstorm,” he told a friend. “I never know when I will find some wonderful prize.”\
What does the reader learn about Bentley from paragraphs 10 and 11?\
(A) He was more interested in sharing his work than in making money from it.\
 (B) He worked hard to develop a way of making photographs of snowflakes.\
 (C) He wanted to find out if all snowflakes were different from each other.\
 (D) He was able to follow his interests because of the help he got from his family.\

 Mrs. Majeska and the Lost Gloves\
 \
 by Ethel Pochocki\
 \
 (paragraph 1) One crisp fall morning, Mrs. Majeska woke up with a craving for sauerkraut. It was so strong, she could smell it, she could taste it, and she knew she must have it for supper. So she put on her walking shoes, picked up her tub with a lid and a handle, and went into town to buy some.\
 \
 sauerkraut = chopped, pickled cabbage\
 \
  (paragraph 2) She walked briskly, enjoying the wind messing up her hair and the parade of dried leaves dancing ahead of her. It was a glorious day, and the thought of sauerkraut for supper, with a bit of apple and onion and sausage, made her want to dance along with the leaves.\
 \
 (paragraph 3) But suddenly she stopped. In the road there was a glove, a small black glove, the ﬁngers still plump, as if it had just left its owner’s hand. It was out of place in the middle of the road.\
 \
 (paragraph 4) Poor thing, thought Mrs. Majeska. I cannot leave it there. She picked it up quickly— a logging truck was coming—and laid it on the grass. She felt sorry for its owner, who now had only one glove. What good was one glove?\
 \
 (paragraph 5) On the way home from the store, she walked on the other side of the road, the sauerkraut sloshing inside the tub. A cluster of children came toward her, laughing and shouting to one another as they took turns kicking something in the dust. Finally they tired of it and ran off past Mrs. Majeska.\
 \
 (paragraph 6) She looked down at the sorry thing they had been kicking. It was another black glove, of the same size and shape as the one she had rescued. She examined it—yes, it was the mate to the other!\
 \
 (paragraph 7) Mrs. Majeska hesitated, then continued walking. It was only a glove, after all, not a child or a kitten or a wallet. Suddenly she stopped, turned around, and walked back to the crumpled bit of cloth. She picked it up, shook it out, and brushed off the dirt. It looked almost as good as new.\
 \
 (paragraph 8) With the glove in one hand and the tub of sauerkraut in the other, she strode down the road to where the other glove still lay in the grass. She placed its mate beside it, satisﬁed that they were now together. For what good was one glove without the other?\
 \
 (paragraph 9) A boy whizzed by on a bike and looked at her. Two old ladies, arm in arm, marched toward her on their way to the post ofﬁce. Mrs. Maj eska bent down and pretended to tie her Shoelaces, for she felt foolish to be caught in the act of reuniting a pair of gloves.\
 \
 (paragraph 10) That night, after a supper as delicious as she had imagined it, Mrs. Majeska sat in her rocker and thought about the gloves. She wished she had brought them home to use for herself. Their owner had probably already given them up for lost. The next morning,\
 after she had her coffee and read the newspaper, she decided to go back and get the gloves. But they were gone.\
 \
 (paragraph 11) Mrs. Majeska was mystiﬁed. Who—beside herself—would want a pair of gloves lying by the side of the road? Perhaps the owner had retraced her steps and rejoiced in ﬁnding them? Or maybe a housewife on a cleaning binge had used them to polish the stove? Or maybe a puppy needed something to chew on? Or a squirrel, to line its nest for winter?\
 \
 (paragraph 12) Mrs. Majeska would never know, but as long as she did not know, she would believe in a happy ending. No matter what their fate, the gloves were together, and that was all that mattered.\
What does the point of view in paragraph 11 help the reader to understand?\
(A) an owner’s joy in ﬁnding the gloves\
 (B) Mrs. Majeska’s concern that a puppy might chew the gloves\
 (C) a housewife’s eagerness to put the gloves to use\
 (D) Mrs. Majeska’s surprise that someone took the gloves\

Excerpt from Gregor and the Sheep\
 by Toby Rosenstrauch\
 \
 (paragraph 1) In a valley in the highlands of Scotland, there once lived a young tenant farmer, Gregor, and his widowed mother. Although they worked hard, they could never accumulate enough money to buy the flock of sheep they longed to have, for their small parcel of land produced only modest amounts of oats and barley. To make matters worse, MacTavish, the owner of this and many other crofts, always found reasons not to pay the farmers all they had earned. . . .\
 \
 crofts = small farms\
 \
 (paragraph 2) When he opened the door each morning and looked out, he saw MacTavish’s house on top of a mountain, a magnificent stone mansion surrounded by red, pink, and violet rhododendrons. Gregor often climbed the slope and stood outside the iron gates, wondering what fine furnishings and delicious foods lay within. Neighbors claimed that MacTavish owned many houses and even kept a chest of gems under his bed. As Gregor, his mother, and their neighbors grew gaunt and pale with hard work and not enough food, they railed against MacTavish, who had swindled all of them at one time or another.\
 \
 swindled = cheated or tricked\
 \
 (paragraph 3) One day, as Gregor listened to the bagpipe music that drifted from the open windows of MacTavish’s mansion, he had an idea. That night, when his mother was asleep, he emptied the jug that held their money and counted it. After putting back a few coins for food, he put the rest in his pocket. The next morning, he hurried to the market, where he went from farmer to farmer, asking the prices of sheep for sale. Gregor found many handsome animals, but they were all too expensive. When he reached a stall with scrawny and sickly sheep, the owner beckoned to him. . . .\
 \
 (paragraph 4) Gregor shook his head and began to walk away. The man grabbed his sleeve and whispered in his ear, “This one will make her owner rich!” Gregor examined the old sheep with spindly legs and dirty, unkempt wool—the worst of the lot. “If she will make me rich,” said Gregor, “how is it that she has not done so for you?”\
 \
 (paragraph 5) The man paused, thinking. “I have not had her long enough!”\
 \
 (paragraph 6) “Nonsense,” said Gregor, but he gave the man his money and led the pitiful animal home.\
 \
 (paragraph 7) When his mother saw what he had bought with their money, she burst into tears. “My foolish son, what have you done? Now we will starve, and no one will help us!”\
 \
 (paragraph 8) “Do as I say, Mother, and we will be rich. I promise.”\
 \
 (paragraph 9) She wanted to believe him. Wiping her eyes with her ragged sleeve, she asked what he wanted her to do.\
 \
 (paragraph 10) “Go to market and tell everyone that your son has a sheep that will make whoever owns her rich,” said Gregor. . . .\
 \
 (paragraph 11) One morning, a carriage arrived. Two servants opened the door and a stout, welldressed gentleman emerged. His Tartan kilt was made of the finest wool, his ascot was pure silk, and his shoes had silver buckles. On his fat fingers were eight gold rings, and his pomaded hair glistened in the sun. It was MacTavish!\
 \
 Tartan kilt = traditional clothing worn by Scottish Highlanders\
 \
 ascot = a type of necktie\
 \
 (paragraph 12) Gregor bowed as if to royalty. MacTavish looked at him sternly. “I have come to rid you of the unfortunate sheep that everyone is talking about,” said MacTavish, opening his sporran. “I can pay your price and I will have her, even though she has done nothing for you, I see.” MacTavish sneered at Gregor.\
 \
 sporran = a small bag worn at the waist for holding personal items\
 \
 (paragraph 13) Gregor hugged Dear One. “I will not sell her to you!”\
 \
 (paragraph 14) ”At that, MacTavish, whose servants were helping him into his carriage, turned and marched back. “I will pay anything,” he said. “Name the price.”\
 \
 (paragraph 15) Gregor was ready. “That,” he said, pointing up to the mansion above them. “I will have the dwelling and everything in it—furniture, utensils, even the chest of gems under your bed.”\
 \
 (paragraph 16) “Done,” said MacTavish.\
 \
 (paragraph 17) The next day, Gregor and his mother moved into the mansion that had once belonged to MacTavish, and MacTavish brought Dear One to the market so that all might see he could indeed own anything he wanted. Then MacTavish and the sheep rode away in his carriage to another of his houses in a valley beyond the mountains.\
 \
 (paragraph 18) After months had passed and the sheep had done nothing to increase MacTavish’s riches, he realized he had been swindled. Furious beyond speech, he returned to the mansion, but Gregor would not open the gates.\
 \
 (paragraph 19) “I have been cheated!” shouted MacTavish.\
 \
 (paragraph 20) “You have not been cheated,” said Gregor. “I was the owner of the sheep, and she has made me rich, hasn’t she?”\
 \
 (paragraph 21) “Yes, but . . . ,” sputtered MacTavish.\
 \
 (paragraph 22) “Then you got what you paid for.” Gregor turned and walked away.\
 \
 (paragraph 23) Soon afterward, Gregor sold the chest of gems and bought the huge flock of sheep he and his mother had always wanted. He shared the rest of his fortune with the other poor families of the valley who had been cheated by MacTavish.\
How are Gregor and the man who sold the sheep to him similar?\
(A) They are both unskilled at selling things to people.\
 (B) They both try to trick someone in order to make money.\
 (C) They are both concerned with helping their family and neighbors.\
 (D) They both believe that animals can have special qualities.\

Excerpt from “The Beadwork” from American Indian Stories\
 \
 by Zitkala-Sa\
 \
 (paragraph 1) Soon after breakfast mother sometimes began her beadwork. On a bright, clear day, she pulled out the wooden pegs that pinned the skirt of our wigwam to the ground, and rolled the canvas part way up on its frame of slender poles. Then the cool morning breezes swept freely through our dwelling, now and then wafting the perfume of sweet grasses from the newly burnt prairie.\
 \
 (paragraph 2) Untying the long tasseled strings that bound a small brown buckskin bag, my mother spread upon a mat beside her bunches of colored beads, just as an artist arranges the paints upon his palette. On a lapboard she smoothed out a double sheet of soft white buckskin; and drawing from a beaded case that hung on the left of her wide\
 belt a long, narrow blade, she trimmed the buckskin into shape. Often she worked upon small moccasins for her small daughter. Then I became intensely interested in her designing. With a proud, beaming face, I watched her work. In imagination, I saw myself walking in a new pair of snugly fitting moccasins. I felt the envious eyes of my playmates upon the pretty red beads decorating my feet.\
 \
 (paragraph 3) Close beside my mother I sat on a rug, with a scrap of buckskin in one hand and an awl in the other. This was the beginning of my practical observation lessons in the art of beadwork. From a skein of finely twisted threads of silvery sinews my mother pulled out a single one. With an awl she pierced the buckskin, and skillfully threaded it with the white sinew. Picking up the tiny beads one by one, she strung them with the point of her thread, always twisting it carefully after every stitch. . . .\
 \
 (paragraph 4) Always after these confining lessons I was wild with surplus spirits, and found joyous relief in running loose in the open again. Many a summer afternoon a party of four or five of my playmates roamed over the hills with me. We each carried a light, sharpened rod about four feet long, with which we pried up certain sweet roots. When we had eaten all the choice roots we chanced upon, we shouldered our rods and strayed off into patches of a stalky plant under whose yellow blossoms we found little crystal drops of gum. Drop by drop we gathered this nature’s rock-candy, until each of us could boast of a lump the size of a small bird’s egg. Soon satiated (satiated - completely satisfied) with its woody flavor, we tossed away our gum, to return again to the sweet roots.\
 \
 (paragraph 5) I remember well how we used to exchange our necklaces, beaded belts, and sometimes even our moccasins. We pretended to offer them as gifts to one another. We delighted in impersonating our own mothers. We talked of things we had heard them say in their conversations. We imitated their various manners, even to the inflection of their voices. In the lap of the prairie we seated ourselves upon our feet, and leaning our painted cheeks in the palms of our hands, we rested our elbows on our knees, and bent forward as old women were most accustomed to do.\
 \
 (paragraph 6) While one was telling of some heroic deed recently done by a near relative, the rest of us listened attentively, and exclaimed in undertones “Han! han!” (yes! yes!) whenever the speaker paused for breath, or sometimes for our sympathy. As the discourse became more thrilling, according to our ideas, we raised our voices in these interjections. In these impersonations our parents were led to say only those things that were in common favor.\
 \
 (paragraph 7) No matter how exciting a tale we might be rehearsing, the mere shifting of a cloud shadow in the landscape near by was sufficient to change our impulses; and soon we were all chasing the great shadows that played among the hills. We shouted and whooped in the chase; laughing and calling to one another, we were like little sportive nymphs (sportive nymphs - playful creatures of the woods) on that Dakota sea of rolling green.\
 \
 (paragraph 8) On one occasion I forgot the cloud shadow in a strange notion to catch up with my own shadow. Standing straight and still, I began to glide after it, putting out one foot cautiously. When, with the greatest care, I set my foot in advance of myself, my shadow crept onward too. Then again I tried it; this time with the other foot. Still again my shadow escaped me. I began to run; and away flew my shadow, always just a step beyond me. Faster and faster I ran, setting my teeth and clenching my fists, determined to overtake my own fleet shadow. But ever swifter it glided before me while I was growing breathless and hot. Slackening my speed, I was greatly vexed that my shadow should check its pace also. Daring it to the utmost, as I thought, I sat down upon a rock imbedded in the hillside.\
 \
 (paragraph 9) So! my shadow had the impudence (impudence - nerve) to sit down beside me!\
 \
 (paragraph 10) Now my comrades caught up with me, and began to ask why I was running away so fast.\
 \
 (paragraph 11) “Oh, I was chasing my shadow! Didn’t you ever do that?” I inquired, surprised that they should not understand.\
 \
 (paragraph 12) They planted their moccasined feet firmly upon my shadow to stay it, and I arose. Again my shadow slipped away, and moved as often as I did. Then we gave up trying to catch my shadow.\
 \
 (paragraph 13) Before this peculiar experience, I have no distinct memory of having recognized any vital bond between myself and my shadow. I never gave it an afterthought.\
 \
 (paragraph 14) Returning to our borrowed belts and trinkets, we rambled homeward. That evening, as on other evenings, I went to sleep over my legends.\
What does the narrator’s frequent use of the word “we” in paragraphs 4 and 5 suggest?\
(A) youthfulness\
 (B) dependence\
 (C) companionship\
 (D) remembrance\

Excerpt from Gregor and the Sheep\
 by Toby Rosenstrauch\
 \
 (paragraph 1) In a valley in the highlands of Scotland, there once lived a young tenant farmer, Gregor, and his widowed mother. Although they worked hard, they could never accumulate enough money to buy the flock of sheep they longed to have, for their small parcel of land produced only modest amounts of oats and barley. To make matters worse, MacTavish, the owner of this and many other crofts, always found reasons not to pay the farmers all they had earned. . . .\
 \
 crofts = small farms\
 \
 (paragraph 2) When he opened the door each morning and looked out, he saw MacTavish’s house on top of a mountain, a magnificent stone mansion surrounded by red, pink, and violet rhododendrons. Gregor often climbed the slope and stood outside the iron gates, wondering what fine furnishings and delicious foods lay within. Neighbors claimed that MacTavish owned many houses and even kept a chest of gems under his bed. As Gregor, his mother, and their neighbors grew gaunt and pale with hard work and not enough food, they railed against MacTavish, who had swindled all of them at one time or another.\
 \
 swindled = cheated or tricked\
 \
 (paragraph 3) One day, as Gregor listened to the bagpipe music that drifted from the open windows of MacTavish’s mansion, he had an idea. That night, when his mother was asleep, he emptied the jug that held their money and counted it. After putting back a few coins for food, he put the rest in his pocket. The next morning, he hurried to the market, where he went from farmer to farmer, asking the prices of sheep for sale. Gregor found many handsome animals, but they were all too expensive. When he reached a stall with scrawny and sickly sheep, the owner beckoned to him. . . .\
 \
 (paragraph 4) Gregor shook his head and began to walk away. The man grabbed his sleeve and whispered in his ear, “This one will make her owner rich!” Gregor examined the old sheep with spindly legs and dirty, unkempt wool—the worst of the lot. “If she will make me rich,” said Gregor, “how is it that she has not done so for you?”\
 \
 (paragraph 5) The man paused, thinking. “I have not had her long enough!”\
 \
 (paragraph 6) “Nonsense,” said Gregor, but he gave the man his money and led the pitiful animal home.\
 \
 (paragraph 7) When his mother saw what he had bought with their money, she burst into tears. “My foolish son, what have you done? Now we will starve, and no one will help us!”\
 \
 (paragraph 8) “Do as I say, Mother, and we will be rich. I promise.”\
 \
 (paragraph 9) She wanted to believe him. Wiping her eyes with her ragged sleeve, she asked what he wanted her to do.\
 \
 (paragraph 10) “Go to market and tell everyone that your son has a sheep that will make whoever owns her rich,” said Gregor. . . .\
 \
 (paragraph 11) One morning, a carriage arrived. Two servants opened the door and a stout, welldressed gentleman emerged. His Tartan kilt was made of the finest wool, his ascot was pure silk, and his shoes had silver buckles. On his fat fingers were eight gold rings, and his pomaded hair glistened in the sun. It was MacTavish!\
 \
 Tartan kilt = traditional clothing worn by Scottish Highlanders\
 \
 ascot = a type of necktie\
 \
 (paragraph 12) Gregor bowed as if to royalty. MacTavish looked at him sternly. “I have come to rid you of the unfortunate sheep that everyone is talking about,” said MacTavish, opening his sporran. “I can pay your price and I will have her, even though she has done nothing for you, I see.” MacTavish sneered at Gregor.\
 \
 sporran = a small bag worn at the waist for holding personal items\
 \
 (paragraph 13) Gregor hugged Dear One. “I will not sell her to you!”\
 \
 (paragraph 14) ”At that, MacTavish, whose servants were helping him into his carriage, turned and marched back. “I will pay anything,” he said. “Name the price.”\
 \
 (paragraph 15) Gregor was ready. “That,” he said, pointing up to the mansion above them. “I will have the dwelling and everything in it—furniture, utensils, even the chest of gems under your bed.”\
 \
 (paragraph 16) “Done,” said MacTavish.\
 \
 (paragraph 17) The next day, Gregor and his mother moved into the mansion that had once belonged to MacTavish, and MacTavish brought Dear One to the market so that all might see he could indeed own anything he wanted. Then MacTavish and the sheep rode away in his carriage to another of his houses in a valley beyond the mountains.\
 \
 (paragraph 18) After months had passed and the sheep had done nothing to increase MacTavish’s riches, he realized he had been swindled. Furious beyond speech, he returned to the mansion, but Gregor would not open the gates.\
 \
 (paragraph 19) “I have been cheated!” shouted MacTavish.\
 \
 (paragraph 20) “You have not been cheated,” said Gregor. “I was the owner of the sheep, and she has made me rich, hasn’t she?”\
 \
 (paragraph 21) “Yes, but . . . ,” sputtered MacTavish.\
 \
 (paragraph 22) “Then you got what you paid for.” Gregor turned and walked away.\
 \
 (paragraph 23) Soon afterward, Gregor sold the chest of gems and bought the huge flock of sheep he and his mother had always wanted. He shared the rest of his fortune with the other poor families of the valley who had been cheated by MacTavish.\
Which detail would be most important to include in a summary of the story?\
(A) Gregor goes to the market and talks to many farmers about their sheep.\
 (B) Gregor’s mother is asleep when Gregor takes money to buy the sheep.\
 (C) MacTavish lives at another one of his houses after he buys the sheep from\
 Gregor.\
 (D) MacTavish goes to buy Gregor’s sheep after he hears rumors about the\
 animal.\

Two Days With No Phone\
 by Sarah Jane Brian\
 Experts worry that teen texting is out of control. Could you give up your phone for 48 hours? Our brave volunteers did.\
 (paragraph 1) Instead of sleeping, Kenny Alarcon, 16, often texts with his friends through the night. \"You get an urge'\" explains the teen, who lives in the Bronx in New York City. \"When I get a text, I'm itching to respond to it even if I want to sleep.\"\
 (paragraph 2) Franchesca Garcia, a high school senior from Providence, Rhode Island, has also felt the need to stay constantly connected. We asked how many texts she sent and received each day. \"I don't know . . . maybe 1,000?\" she answered. \"It's too many to count.\"\
 (paragraph 3) It probably won't surprise you that teens are texting more than ever before. Some experts are worried about how all that texting is affecting teenagers' lives.\
 \
 Teens in Trouble?\
 \
 (paragraph 4) One concern is that students might not learn correct grammar and spelling if most of the writing they do is made up of text messages. Some people also worry that because teens text so much, they don't spend enough time talking with others face-to-face. That could be hurting their relationships with friends and family.\
 (paragraph 5) Plus, all that texting (and time on social media) takes away from hours that could be spent studying, exercising, pursuing a hobby, or just relaxing.\
 (paragraph 6) Dr. Elizabeth Dowdell is a professor at Villanova University in Pennsylvania. She says that many people expect to be able to access anyone or to be accessed by anyone at any time. \"It's very appealing, especially to a middle or high school student,\" she explains. \"The problem is, there's no downtime.\" And people need downtime-especially when it comes to sleep.\
 \
 Sleep Texting\
 \
 (paragraph 7) Both Franchesca and Kenny told us that they wake up several times during the night to text. Kenny even sleeps with his phone beneath his pillow.\
 (paragraph 8) Dr. Dowdell says that it's common for teens' sleep to be interrupted by texts. Sometimes teens even send texts filled with nonsense words when they don't wake up all the way. She has been studying this trend, which she calls \"sleep texting.\"\
 (paragraph 9) Why is sleep texting a problem? \"Adolescents need a solid 8, 10, even 1 1 hours of sleep to really function and to think clearly\", reports Dr. Dowdell. If they regularly lose sleep, she adds, teens may start having trouble in school. They may become grumpy, angry, or depressed. A lack of sleep can lead to weight gain and even obesity. That's because many people turn to junk food for quick energy when they are tired.\
 \
 The 48-Hour Challenge\
 \
 (paragraph 10) According to Dr. Dowdell, teens need to learn that they can-and should-turn off their phones sometimes. So we decided to have Kenny and Franchesca do an experiment.\
 (paragraph 11) These were the rules: No phone for 48 hours. No computer or Internet either, unless it was for schoolwork. No Twitter, no Instagram.\
 (paragraph 12) Would these two teenagers be able to do it?\
 (paragraph 13) \"I think I'm going to feel really isolated\", Kenny worried. Franchesca was nervous but brave. \"I'm excited for the challenge\", she said. \"I don't know what's going to happen.\"\
 (paragraph 14) Kenny and Franchesca handed their phones to their mothers for safekeeping. The\
 challenge was on.\
 \
 The Results\
 \
 (paragraph 15) We caught up with Kenny and Franchesca after 48 phone-free hours. \"Wow, it was pure torture\", Kenny joked. But though life with no phone wasn't easy, he admitted \"it had benefits.\"\
 (paragraph 16) Sure, Kenny missed his friends, and he was sad at times. But he also felt relief from the constant texting. \"Sometimes it's teenager drama, people gossiping\" he explained. \"I felt less stressed because I didn't have to be involved.\"\
 (paragraph 17) Instead of texting, Kenny went to the gym and caught up on schoolwork. The first night, he told us, \"I slept for 18 hours!\" He also spent time sitting with his family and talking. Kenny's mom helped him with homework for the first time in two years. Said Kenny, \"I felt closer to my parents.\"\
 (paragraph 18) Franchesca had an even happier result when she put away her phone. \"I loved it!\" she said. \"I was going to the gym and hanging out with friends and playing basketball. I had a wonderful experience.\" She slept better too.\
 (paragraph 19) Franchesca decided to continue the experiment for a while. \"I think I'll be so much smarter and healthier,' she explained. \"Everybody in the world should try it.\"\
 (paragraph 20) Kenny doesn't plan to give up his phone again. But he now knows that he can live without it. Said the teen, \"It was a reality check.\"\
What can the reader infer from paragraphs 17 through 20?\
(A) Asking teens to live without their phones will help them become smarter.\
 (B) Teens may not realize how different their lives can be without their phones.\
 (C) Teens around the world will enjoy experimenting with their phone use.\
 (D) Expecting teens to give up their phones is not realistic.\

 Roche Moutonée\
 A roche moutonée is a glacial landscape feature produced as an advancing glacier slides over a hill of surface bedrock. As the glacier advances up the side of the hill, the surface bedrock is abraded and smoothed by rock fragments carried within the base of the glacial ice, creating a more gentle hillslope. As the glacier advances down the opposite side of the hill, chunks of bedrock are broken off and removed by the ice, a process called glacial quarrying (plucking), making this side of the hill steeper. The resulting hill resembles a drumlin, except it is often smaller and is composed of solid bedrock.\
The chunks of bedrock removed by glacial quarrying and transported by the glaciers most likely produce\
(1) terminal outwash plains\
 (2) kettle lake depressions\
 (3) V-shaped valleys\
 (4) parallel scratches in surface bedrock\

Excerpt from “The Beadwork” from American Indian Stories\
 \
 by Zitkala-Sa\
 \
 (paragraph 1) Soon after breakfast mother sometimes began her beadwork. On a bright, clear day, she pulled out the wooden pegs that pinned the skirt of our wigwam to the ground, and rolled the canvas part way up on its frame of slender poles. Then the cool morning breezes swept freely through our dwelling, now and then wafting the perfume of sweet grasses from the newly burnt prairie.\
 \
 (paragraph 2) Untying the long tasseled strings that bound a small brown buckskin bag, my mother spread upon a mat beside her bunches of colored beads, just as an artist arranges the paints upon his palette. On a lapboard she smoothed out a double sheet of soft white buckskin; and drawing from a beaded case that hung on the left of her wide\
 belt a long, narrow blade, she trimmed the buckskin into shape. Often she worked upon small moccasins for her small daughter. Then I became intensely interested in her designing. With a proud, beaming face, I watched her work. In imagination, I saw myself walking in a new pair of snugly fitting moccasins.

Many a summer afternoon a party of four or five of my playmates roamed over the hills with me. We each carried a light, sharpened rod about four feet long, with which we pried up certain sweet roots. When we had eaten all the choice roots we chanced upon, we shouldered our rods and strayed off into patches of a stalky plant under whose yellow blossoms we found little crystal drops of gum. Drop by drop we gathered this nature’s rock-candy, until each of us could boast of a lump the size of a small bird’s egg. Soon satiated (satiated - completely satisfied) with its woody flavor, we tossed away our gum, to return again to the sweet roots.\
 \
 (paragraph 5) I remember well how we used to exchange our necklaces, beaded belts, and sometimes even our moccasins. We pretended to offer them as gifts to one another. We delighted in impersonating our own mothers. We talked of things we had heard them say in their conversations. We imitated their various manners, even to the inflection of their voices. In the lap of the prairie we seated ourselves upon our feet, and leaning our painted cheeks in the palms of our hands, we rested our elbows on our knees, and bent forward as old women were most accustomed to do.\
 \
 (paragraph 6) While one was telling of some heroic deed recently done by a near relative, the rest of us listened attentively, and exclaimed in undertones “Han! han!” (yes! yes!) whenever the speaker paused for breath, or sometimes for our sympathy. As the discourse became more thrilling, according to our ideas, we raised our voices in these interjections. In these impersonations our parents were led to say only those things that were in common favor.\
 \
 (paragraph 7) No matter how exciting a tale we might be rehearsing, the mere shifting of a cloud shadow in the landscape near by was sufficient to change our impulses; and soon we were all chasing the great shadows that played among the hills. We shouted and whooped in the chase; laughing and calling to one another, we were like little sportive nymphs (sportive nymphs - playful creatures of the woods) on that Dakota sea of rolling green.\
 \
 (paragraph 8) On one occasion I forgot the cloud shadow in a strange notion to catch up with my own shadow. Standing straight and still, I began to glide after it, putting out one foot cautiously. When, with the greatest care, I set my foot in advance of myself, my shadow crept onward too. Then again I tried it; this time with the other foot. Still again my shadow escaped me. I began to run; and away flew my shadow, always just a step beyond me. Faster and faster I ran, setting my teeth and clenching my fists, determined to overtake my own fleet shadow. But ever swifter it glided before me while I was growing breathless and hot. Slackening my speed, I was greatly vexed that my shadow should check its pace also. Daring it to the utmost, as I thought, I sat down upon a rock imbedded in the hillside.\
 \
 (paragraph 9) So! my shadow had the impudence (impudence - nerve) to sit down beside me!\
 \
 (paragraph 10) Now my comrades caught up with me, and began to ask why I was running away so fast.\
 \
 (paragraph 11) “Oh, I was chasing my shadow! Didn’t you ever do that?” I inquired, surprised that they should not understand.\
 \
 (paragraph 12) They planted their moccasined feet firmly upon my shadow to stay it, and I arose. Again my shadow slipped away, and moved as often as I did. Then we gave up trying to catch my shadow.\
 \
 (paragraph 13) Before this peculiar experience, I have no distinct memory of having recognized any vital bond between myself and my shadow. I never gave it an afterthought.\
 \
 (paragraph 14) Returning to our borrowed belts and trinkets, we rambled homeward. That evening, as on other evenings, I went to sleep over my legends.\
The central idea of paragraph 4 is\
(A) children enjoy eating sweet things\
 (B) the narrator is a leader among her friends\
 (C) children are able to make their own fun\
 (D) the setting has many natural resources\

 Reading Comprehension Passage A\
 \
 Caramelo\
 \
    One would think now that she was living in Chicago, in the same city as her [favorite son] \
 Inocencio, the Grandmother would find happiness. But no, that wasn’t the case. The \
 Grandmother was meaner than ever. She was unhappy. And didn’t know she was unhappy, \
 the worst kind of unhappiness of all. As a result, everyone was in a hurry to find her a house\
 (line 5) of some sort. A bungalow, a duplex, a brownstone, an apartment. Something, anything, \
 because the Grandmother’s gloominess was the contagious kind, infecting every member of \
 the household as fiercely as the bubonic plague. \
    Because Baby [Inocencio’s brother] and Ninfa’s apartment had room to accommodate \
 a guest, it was understood the Grandmother would stay with them until she could find a \
 (line 10) house of her own. This had seemed all well and fine when the plans were made long-\
 distance with Uncle Baby shouting into the receiver that he insisted, that he and Ninfa \
 wouldn’t think of her staying anywhere else, that the girls were thrilled she was coming. But \
 now that she was actually sleeping in [granddaughter] Amor’s narrow bed with radios and \
 televisions chattering throughout the apartment, and doors and cupboards banging, and the \
 (line 15) stink of cigarettes soaking into everything, even her skin, and trucks rumbling past and \
 shaking the building like an earthquake, and sirens and car horns at all hours, well, it just \
 about drove her crazy; even the rowdy Chicago wind, a rough, moody brute who took one \
 look at you and laughed. …\
    All day and all night the expressway traffic whooshed past, keeping the Grandmother\
 (line 20) awake. She napped when she could, even when the apartment and its inhabitants jabbered \
 the loudest. She was tired all the time, and yet she had trouble sleeping, often waking once \
 or twice in the early morning, and in her sleeplessness, padding in her house slippers to the \
 living room, where the front windows looked out onto the lanes of traffic, the expressway \
 billboards, and the frighteningly grimy factories beyond. The trucks and cars, furious to get\
 (line 25) from here to there, never paused for a moment, the sound of the expressway almost not a \
 sound at all, but a roar like the voice of the sea trapped inside a shell. \
    She pressed her forehead against the cold glass and sighed. If the Grandmother had \
 consulted her feelings, she would’ve understood why it was taking her so long to buy a new \
 house and settle in Chicago, but she was not a woman given to reflection. She missed her\
 (line 30) old house too much and was too proud to admit she’d made a mistake. She couldn’t go \
 backward, could she? She was stuck, in the middle of nowhere it seemed, halfway between \
 here and where? \
    The Grandmother missed the routine of her mornings, her three-minute eggs and \
 bolillo (bolillo - crunchy roll) breakfasts. She missed rubbing her big toe along the octagon tiles of her bathroom \
 (line 35) floor. But most of all, she missed her own bed with its mattress sagging in the center, the \
 familiar scent and weight of her blankets, the way morning entered gradually from the left\
 as the sun climbed over the east courtyard wall, the one topped with a cockscomb (cockscomb -rooster’s crown with jagged edges) of glass \
 shards to keep out the thieves. Why do we get so used to waking up in a certain room? And \
 when we aren’t in our own bed and wake up in another, a terrible fear for a moment, like\
 (line 40) death.\
    There is nothing worse than being a houseguest for too long, especially when your host\
 is a relative. The Grandmother felt like a prisoner. She hated climbing up the three flights\
 of stairs, and always arrived clutching her heart, convinced she was having an attack, like\
 the one that killed Narciso [her husband]. Really, once she was upstairs, she couldn’t even\
 (line 45) bear the thought of coming back down. What a barbarity! …\
    To visit Chicago is one thing, to live there another. This was not the Chicago of her\
 vacations, where one is always escorted to the lake shore, to the gold coast, driven along the\
 winding lanes of traffic of Lake Shore Drive in the shadow of beautiful apartment buildings,\
 along State Street and Michigan Avenue to window-shop at least. And perhaps taken on an\
 (line 50) excursion on the lake. How is it she hadn’t noticed the expression of the citizens, not the\
 ones fluttering in and out of taxis, but the ones at bus stops, hopping like sparrows, shivering\
 and peering anxiously for the next bus, and those descending wearily into the filthy bowels\
 of the subway like the souls condemned to purgatory.(purgatory - place of suffering)\
    At first the Grandmother was thrilled by the restaurants and the big discount chains—\
 (line 55) but then the routine got to be too familiar. Saturdays in search of houses that were not to\
 her liking. Dark brick houses with small, squinty windows, gloomy apartments, or damp\
 little bungalows, everything somber and sad and not letting in enough light, and no\
 courtyards, a dank, (dank - damp) mean gangway, a small patch of thin grass called a garden, and maybe a\
 bald tree in front. This wasn’t what she had in mind.\
 (line 60)   And as the weeks and months passed, and she was still without a house, the rainy, cold\
 autumn weather began and only made her feel worse. There was the Chicago winter\
 coming that everyone had warned her about, and she was already so cold and miserable she\
 didn’t feel much like leaving her room, let alone the building. She blamed Ninfa, who kept\
 lowering the heat in order to save money. The Grandmother confined herself to bed,\
 (line 65) satisfied only when she was under several layers of blankets. …\
    But nothing, nothing in the Grandmother’s imagination prepared her for the horrors of\
 a Chicago winter. It was not the picturesque (picturesque - charming) season of Christmas, but the endless tundra\
 of January, February, and March. Daylight dimmed to a dull pewter. (pewter - gray) The sun a thick piece\
 of ice behind a dirty woolen sky. It was a cold like you can’t imagine, a barbarous thing, a\
 (line 70) knife in the bone, a cold so cold it burned the lungs if one could even believe such a cold.\
 And the mountains of filthy snow shoveled in huge heaps, the chunks of ice on the sidewalk\
 that could kill an aged citizen. —Oh, this is nothing, you should’ve been here for the Big\
 Snow, the grandchildren bragged, speaking of the recent storm of ’68.\
    Big snow or little snow, it was all the same after the novelty of snow had worn off. A\
 (line 75) nuisance, a deadly thing, an exaggerated, long, drawn-out ordeal that made one feel like\
 dying, that killed one slowly, a torture. Let me die in February, let me die rather than have\
 to step out the door again, please, the Grandmother thought to herself, dreading having to\
 dress like a monster to go outside. —Ay, ya no puedo. I can’t anymore, I can’t. And just\
 when she could no longer, when she could no longer find the strength, the drive, the will to\
 (line 80) keep on living, when she was ready to fold into herself and let her spirit die, just then, and\
 only then, did April arrive with sky the color of hope and branches filled with possibilities.\

Seriously, We’re Poisonous: Coloration Is An Honest Signal Of Toxicity In Poison Frogs\
 The conspicuous [noticeable] colors of poisonous frogs serve as a warning to predators: Don’t eat me; I’m toxic. And a new study shows that in the case of at least one frog species, they aren’t bluffing–the more conspicuous the color, the more poisonous the frog. Researchers Martine Maan (University of Groningen, the Netherlands) and Molly Cummings (University of Texas) studied strawberry poison dart frogs, which are native to Panama and come in more than a dozen different color patterns that vary from region to region.…\
 …Maan and Cummings tested the toxicity levels of 10 differently colored frog populations. Then using known properties of birds’ visual systems, the researchers estimated how each color pattern would look to a bird, an important frog predator. The results show that frogs with more conspicuous color patterns–as seen by birds–tended to be more toxic. The findings suggest that “birds can predict the toxicity of frogs by\
 looking at their colors, possibly better than the frogs can themselves,” Maan said.…\

 If a sudden genetic mutation in the birds that feed on these frogs made them able to consume any amount of the poison with no harm to them, it is most likely that\

 (3) without the protection of the poison, all of the frogs would need to change color to become less conspicuous\

Alan is on a volcano on Titan, a moon of Saturn. As the story opens, Alan is stranded on its summit in his space crawler. Luckily, he has brought along his mechanical wings.\
 \
 Excerpt from Fly for Your Life\
 \
 by John Frizell\
 \
 (paragraph 1) Alan knew there was no way back to the base and no way the crew there could help him remotely—the other crawler was down for maintenance. He could go down this side of the stream for 23 kilometers, to a flat area where the flowing liquid would spread out and be shallow enough to cross; then go back 23 kilometers to the far side of the bridge. One problem: he would definitely run out of air before he got there.\
 \
 (paragraph 2) Then Alan thought of the folded flight wings he had attached to his suit. Could he fly across the river and then walk to the base? Some quick calculations showed it wouldn’t work. He had enough air, but the battery that powered the heater of the suit he wore to stay alive on Titan was only good for an hour, not the four-hour walk it would take to reach the base. Spacewalks were usually done trailing a power cable plugged in to the suit. The cable carried power from the crawler to supplement the suit’s battery. Without the supplemental power, he would freeze solid in 10 minutes once the battery was exhausted.\
 \
 (paragraph 3) Alan knew flying the whole way was impossible. Even with Titan’s thick atmosphere and low gravity the suit made flying hard work, worse than running uphill carrying a sack of cement. No one could stay aloft for more than 10 minutes. It would be at least a half-hour flight to the base.\
 \
 (paragraph 4) He needed more than wings alone to get back alive. Then it came to him. Bolted to the side of the crawler was a squat, black cylinder containing compressed nitrogen at 200 bar, compressed Titanian atmosphere in fact, used for cleaning gunk off the crawler’s treads. Alan struggled with the bolts, working carefully in the searing cold with tools as brittle as glass. When he had the cylinder off, propped up, and pointing at the sky, he put his wings on, and then took them off, repeating the task until he could do it without thinking about it. . . .\
 \
 (paragraph 5) He pulled the power cable out of his suit’s hip socket and, before he could change his mind, gave a sharp tug on a line that he had attached to the valve of the pressure cylinder. The cylinder hissed like a giant snake, as high-pressure nitrogen blasted out, and then shot into the sky. A length of climbing rope he had attached to it went taut and snatched him into the air, where he was buffeted and tossed by the jet of nitrogen pouring down on him. It was like being caught under a breaking wave, pounded again and again by the surf. He was directly under the cylinder, using his weight and drag to keep the nozzle pointed down as the cylinder lofted him into Titan’s sky. The ground beneath, blurred by the motion, made it impossible to gauge height or direction.\
 \
 (paragraph 6) Time slowed; his shuddering world narrowed to the readout of the Titan Positioning System (TPS)—the icy moon’s equivalent of GPS. Gradually, the pounding lessened as the rate of climb shown on the readout passed its peak and began falling. Alan waited. Just before it hit zero, he cut the rope. The cylinder, relieved of his drag, flew off, dwindling to a black dot and then disappearing into the empty sky above. Now he was coasting upward, propelled by the momentum imparted to him by the nitrogen rocket. He was high in the air, but already he was slowing under the drag of the thick atmosphere. He had to get the wings on before the downward fall began. Once he started to move with some speed, he would begin to spin and never get them on. The first wing stuck and he had to take his arm out of the loops and try again. . . .\
 \
 (paragraph 7) He was gathering speed on his way down before he got the second one on. He spread his wings and rolled into a comfortable position, soaring over the moon’s dimly lit surface. The TPS showed that he was heading away from the base. He banked in an easy curve and settled on a course for home. All he had to do was hold the wings rigid and enjoy the ride. He took an occasional flap, just for fun. . . .\
 \
 (paragraph 8) As Alan glided toward the base, he flapped more often, watching the height-abovesurface and distance-to-target displays. As they unwound, an unpleasant feeling, like a trace of the frigid atmosphere outside, crept into his stomach. His elevation was dropping dangerously, with over three kilometers left to go on distance-to-target. He could see details on the surface more clearly now, because he was flying so low. . . .\
 \
 (paragraph 9) Alan forced himself to stay calm. Panic would mean disaster. He started flapping his wings faster, faster, faster. . . . He could feel himself lifting with every beat of the massive appendages. Faster, faster, faster. . . . His descent rate began to slow, but the muscles in his arms burned with pain. . . .\
 \
 (paragraph 10) Time stretched out endlessly.\
 \
 (paragraph 11) The TPS buzzed loudly in his helmet. Target. the station’s beacon was directly below him. He could barely feel his arms, but something made them stop flapping. He gratefully fell out of the sky, wrapped in a ball of pain, with barely the strength to flare his wings one last time for a soft landing. . . .\
 \
 (paragraph 12) Then he saw someone running toward him with a power cable in hand. Voices boomed into his helmet. It sounded like the whole station was in the control room waiting to see if he had made it.\
 \
 (paragraph 13) “Alan! ALAN! Say something! Can you move? Are you receiving this?” He recognized the voice of the base leader. . . .\
 \
 (paragraph 14) As the crew lifted him carefully onto a stretcher, he looked up at Titan’s hazy sky. I flew for my life today, he thought. I survived. That’s the only record that matters.\
Which sentence would be most important to include in a summary of the story?\
(A) A cable connects space suits to a power source for spacewalks.\
 (B) The power from the nitrogen blast allows Alan to travel farther and faster.\
 (C) Alan soars away from his target during part of his flight.\

 Excerpt from Waste Not, Want Not\
 by Teresa Bateman\
 \
 (paragraph 1) My mother believed in using things up. We always squeezed the toothpaste tube until it was as sharp as a razor, and we cleaned our plates, even when it was liver-andonions\
 night. . . .\
 \
 (paragraph 2) Mom’s frugality was legendary. She could make one chicken come back in a dozen meals as variously disguised leftovers. Her favorite saying was “waste not, want not.” Josh and I weren’t sure what that meant, but it probably explained why Mom was into recycling long before it became popular. It also explained why the “Affair of the Hat,” as it later became known, was so strange.\
 \
 (paragraph 3) The Hat deserved capital letters. It was about three feet across, made of green straw and covered with big plastic daisies, two red peonies, and an orange bow. I might have said it was “dog ugly,” except that wouldn’t sit well with our dog, Mutt.\
 \
 (paragraph 4) Great-aunt Marjorie had given The Hat to Mother on one of her visits to our farm. It was supposed to keep the sun off Mother’s delicate complexion while enhancing her rural beauty (whatever that meant). . . .\
 \
 (paragraph 5) When Aunt Marjorie returned to the city, Josh and I held our breath to see what would happen to The Hat. We could see that Mom’s thrifty nature and fashion sense were in pitched battle. She couldn’t justify throwing The Hat away—it was nearly new and had a lot of use left in it—but neither could she stomach wearing it. She tried pulling off the daisies and peonies, but they were stuck on tight, as were the perky orange ribbons that held The Hat in place. She’d have to find some other solution.\
 \
 (paragraph 6) One day Josh and I came down to breakfast and noticed that The Hat was missing from the hook by the door. We looked at each other, then scouted the house. It wasn’t hard to spot. Mother had installed it in the parlor as a lampshade.\
 \
 (paragraph 7) Our parakeet, Pete, chirped inquiringly from his cage as Josh and I decided to see how The Hat looked in full lampshade glory. We pulled the chain.\
 \
 (paragraph 8 ) Pete tweeted once, then dropped like a stone from his perch. We ran to his cage, and Josh suggested mouth-to-beak resuscitation. Then we glanced over at the lamp. The light shining through the peonies made them look like two big red eyes glaring at you. No wonder Pete had fainted. We plucked The Hat from the lamp and went to tell Mom. Reluctantly she hung it back up on the hook by the door. . . .\
 \
 (paragraph 9) The next morning she headed out the door, The Hat filled to the brim with turkey feed. Josh and I watched as Mother approached the turkeys scavenging in the barnyard. The minute those turkeys sighted The Hat, they ran gobbling toward the barn door and dived in a panic into the haystack. Mom dumped the turkey feed in the barnyard and\
 walked back to the house, her shoulders drooping. . . .\
 \
 (paragraph 10) She threw The Hat to the floor, raised her foot, and screamed, “THIS HAT IS FOR THE BIRDS!” Josh and I stepped back, waiting for her foot to come crashing down.\
 \
 (paragraph 11) “It is not for the birds,” Josh blurted. \"They hate it!”\
 \
 (paragraph 12) It was as though time stood still. Then we heard a strange sound. Mother was laughing!\
 \
 (paragraph 13) We shook our heads. She’d finally gone over the edge—there she stood, one foot in the air, laughing like a hysterical flamingo.\
 \
 (paragraph 14) Then she put her foot down . . . on the floor. She picked up The Hat and headed upstairs where we heard boxes being shuffled around in the attic. . .\
 \
 (paragraph 15) When she came down, she was dragging a body. It was wearing Grandpa’s old overalls, Uncle Paul’s flannel shirt, and the shoes Josh had outgrown last year. Its head was a flour sack, stuffed full of straw from an old tick, and on that head perched The Hat.\
 \
 tick = mattress\
 \
 (paragraph 16) Mom hauled the stuffed body outside and set it up on a post in the middle of the cornfield. And that’s where it stayed.\
 \
 (paragraph 17) Our corn crop that year was particularly good. For some reason the birds steered clear of our fields and raided the neighbors’ instead. Maybe it had something to do with our scarecrow, I don’t know. All I do know is that from then on, we rarely saw crows on our property except during the month of June.\
 \
 (paragraph 16) That’s when Great-aunt Marjorie comes to visit.\
Read this sentence from paragraph 12.\

(A) Everyone was pleased.\
 (B) Nobody moved or spoke.\

In West Africa, the Harmattan is a dry, dust-filled wind.\
 Excerpt from A Scrap and a Robe\
 by Myrina D. McCullough\
 \
 (paragraph 1) The West African Harmattan whipped up a billow of dust. Suddenly Sali spied a scrap of glorious orange damask cloth turning in the hot wind like a flame. She followed as it danced down a street she didn’t know very well. She skipped over holes and skirted people on chairs.\
 damask = woven cloth\
 skirted = went around\
 (paragraph 2) All at once the wind died down, and the scrap settled gently on the scratchy, sandy road.\
 (paragraph 3) Sali picked up the cloth and gazed at it with admiring eyes. She turned it this way and that in the sun and imagined herself in a flowing dlokibani made of such cloth. This was a treasure, and she would take it home for her little wooden doll. It would surely make a lovely headpiece for that lucky one.\
 dlokibani or dloki = a long dress\
 (paragraph 4) Sali wandered back the way she had come, slowly now. At the corner of the street, she passed the table vendor, who was selling his dusty packets of tea and two-pill packs of aspirin. She passed Ami’s mother, roasting peanuts and selling them by the handful. She turned onto the larger street and passed a plastic-goods store that displayed rows and rows of brightly colored plastic plates, bowls, and teapots. She glanced into the next shop and then stopped short. It was a fabric shop! There on the high counter was an entire bolt of the same wondrous cloth she held in her hand!\
 (paragraph 5) The next day Sali went back to the cloth shop. She stood near the door and watched the storekeeper. He measured and cut, as one person after another bought pieces of cloth. Her prized orange damask was back on a high shelf to the rear of the store.\
 (paragraph 6) After a while the shopkeeper looked at Sali. “Why do you stand so long at the door?” he asked.\
 (paragraph 7) Sali took a deep breath and said, “I would like to help you in the store till I could earn enough of that orange cloth to make a dlokibani for myself.”\
 (paragraph 8) The orange fabric glowed in a shaft of light from the uncovered bulb at the back of the store.\
 (paragraph 9) “That is very special and expensive cloth, little one,” the shopkeeper told her.\
 (paragraph 10) So she swept the courtyard and threw away scraps. She pushed big rolls of cloth back and forth. She ran to buy cough drops and peanuts and kola nuts for the shopkeeper. For days and days she worked.\
 (paragraph 11) Finally, one day the store owner lifted down the lustrous roll of orange damask and measured out several yards. “You’ve worked well for this cloth, Sali,” he said. “I thank you.”\
 (paragraph 12) Sali rushed straight home with her treasure. Carefully she placed the cloth in her trunk.\
 (paragraph 13) But how was she to get the dloki made? Sali did not know how to sew. Her mother always had their clothes made by a tailor who sat in a tiny shop several blocks from their house.\
 (paragraph 14) Sali went and stood under a tree near the tailor’s shop. She watched the people come and go. The tailor would whip out his measuring tape and see how tall the people were, how fat they were, how long their arms, how short their necks. He measured every part of them.\
 (paragraph 15) After almost a whole day the tailor noticed Sali.\
 (paragraph 16) “What are you doing there, little girl?” he asked.\
 (paragraph 17) “I have some beautiful cloth,” she said, “and I want it sewn into a dlokibani. Could I work for you to pay for sewing it into a robe for me?”\
 (paragraph 18) The tailor agreed. Once again Sali worked for days and days. She swept and fanned the tea coals and held scissors and brought thread. At last, the tailor said, “Bring me the cloth, Sali.”\
 (paragraph 19) Sali rushed home and brought back the satiny, shining cloth. She also brought her doll, its small head still neatly wrapped in the swatch of orange. The tailor took his tape and measured Sali, shoulder to ankle, shoulder to elbow, left shoulder to right shoulder. Then he started cutting the billows of orange fabric.\
 (paragraph 20) The next day was an important holiday called Tabaski. Drums were beating in many neighborhoods. Relatives and friends came to visit Sali’s family. Sali slipped quietly away. Soon her mother missed her. “Now where has Sali gone?” she exclaimed.\
 (paragraph 21) Just then, Sali walked in, proudly wearing a beautiful orange dloki with a matching headdress. In her arms she carried her doll, dressed exactly as she was!\
What does paragraph 13 reveal about Sali’s point of view?\
(A) Sali is worried that all of her work will be wasted if she cannot complete her project.\
 (B) Sali is eager to learn new skills so that she can take care of herself like a grownup.\
 (C) Sali is delighted to keep her secret and surprise her family with her new dlokibani.\
 (D) Sali is unsure and does not have a detailed plan to have the dlokibani made.\

 Excerpt from Gregor and the Sheep\
 by Toby Rosenstrauch\
 \
 (paragraph 1) In a valley in the highlands of Scotland, there once lived a young tenant farmer, Gregor, and his widowed mother. Although they worked hard, they could never accumulate enough money to buy the flock of sheep they longed to have, for their small parcel of land produced only modest amounts of oats and barley. To make matters\
 worse, MacTavish, the owner of this and many other crofts, always found reasons not to pay the farmers all they had earned. . . .\
 \
 crofts = small farms\
 \
 (paragraph 2) When he opened the door each morning and looked out, he saw MacTavish’s house on top of a mountain, a magnificent stone mansion surrounded by red, pink, and violet rhododendrons. Gregor often climbed the slope and stood outside the iron gates, wondering what fine furnishings and delicious foods lay within. Neighbors claimed\
 that MacTavish owned many houses and even kept a chest of gems under his bed. As Gregor, his mother, and their neighbors grew gaunt and pale with hard work and not enough food, they railed against MacTavish, who had swindled all of them at one time or another.\
 \
 swindled = cheated or tricked\
 \
 (paragraph 3) One day, as Gregor listened to the bagpipe music that drifted from the open windows of MacTavish’s mansion, he had an idea. That night, when his mother was asleep, he emptied the jug that held their money and counted it. After putting back a few coins for food, he put the rest in his pocket. The next morning, he hurried to the market, where he went from farmer to farmer, asking the prices of sheep for sale.\
 Gregor found many handsome animals, but they were all too expensive. When he reached a stall with scrawny and sickly sheep, the owner beckoned to him. . . .\
 \
 (paragraph 4) Gregor shook his head and began to walk away. The man grabbed his sleeve and whispered in his ear, “This one will make her owner rich!” Gregor examined the old sheep with spindly legs and dirty, unkempt wool—the worst of the lot. “If she will make me rich,” said Gregor, “how is it that she has not done so for you?”\
 \
 (paragraph 5) The man paused, thinking. “I have not had her long enough!”\
 \
 (paragraph 6) “Nonsense,” said Gregor, but he gave the man his money and led the pitiful animal home.\
 \
 (paragraph 7) When his mother saw what he had bought with their money, she burst into tears. “My foolish son, what have you done? Now we will starve, and no one will help us!”\
 \
 (paragraph 8) “Do as I say, Mother, and we will be rich. I promise.”\
 \
 (paragraph 9) She wanted to believe him. Wiping her eyes with her ragged sleeve, she asked what he wanted her to do.\
 \
 (paragraph 10) “Go to market and tell everyone that your son has a sheep that will make whoever owns her rich,” said Gregor. . . .\
 \
 (paragraph 11) One morning, a carriage arrived. Two servants opened the door and a stout, welldressed gentleman emerged. His Tartan kilt was made of the finest wool, his ascot was pure silk, and his shoes had silver buckles. On his fat fingers were eight gold rings, and his pomaded hair glistened in the sun. It was MacTavish!\
 \
 Tartan kilt = traditional clothing worn by Scottish Highlanders\
 \
 ascot = a type of necktie\
 \
 (paragraph 12) Gregor bowed as if to royalty. MacTavish looked at him sternly. “I have come to rid you of the unfortunate sheep that everyone is talking about,” said MacTavish, opening his sporran. “I can pay your price and I will have her, even though she has done nothing for you, I see.” MacTavish sneered at Gregor.\
 \
 sporran = a small bag worn at the waist for holding personal items\
 \
 (paragraph 13) Gregor hugged Dear One. “I will not sell her to you!”\
 \
 (paragraph 14) ”At that, MacTavish, whose servants were helping him into his carriage, turned and marched back. “I will pay anything,” he said. “Name the price.”\
 \
 (paragraph 15) Gregor was ready. “That,” he said, pointing up to the mansion above them. “I will have the dwelling and everything in it—furniture, utensils, even the chest of gems under your bed.”\
 \
 (paragraph 16) “Done,” said MacTavish.\
 \
 (paragraph 17) The next day, Gregor and his mother moved into the mansion that had once belonged to MacTavish, and MacTavish brought Dear One to the market so that all might see he could indeed own anything he wanted. Then MacTavish and the sheep rode away in his carriage to another of his houses in a valley beyond the mountains.\
 \
 (paragraph 18) After months had passed and the sheep had done nothing to increase MacTavish’s riches, he realized he had been swindled. Furious beyond speech, he returned to the mansion, but Gregor would not open the gates.\
 \
 (paragraph 19) “I have been cheated!” shouted MacTavish.\
 \
 (paragraph 20) “You have not been cheated,” said Gregor. “I was the owner of the sheep, and she has made me rich, hasn’t she?”\
 \
 (paragraph 21) “Yes, but . . . ,” sputtered MacTavish.\
 \
 (paragraph 22) “Then you got what you paid for.” Gregor turned and walked away.\
 \
 (paragraph 21) Soon afterward, Gregor sold the chest of gems and bought the huge flock of sheep he and his mother had always wanted. He shared the rest of his fortune with the other poor families of the valley who had been cheated by MacTavish.\
How are Gregor and the man who sold the sheep to him similar?\
(A) They are both unskilled at selling things to people.\
 (B) They both try to trick someone in order to make money.\
 (C) They are both concerned with helping their family and neighbors.\
 (D) They both believe that animals can have special qualities.\

Base your answers to questions 36 through 38 on the passage and mineral table below and on your knowledge of Earth science. The table shows some properties of four minerals that display fluorescence.\
 \
 Fluorescent Minerals\
 All minerals have the ability to reflect visible light. Only about 15% of minerals have an interesting physical property known as fluorescence. These minerals have the ability to temporarily absorb a small amount of electromagnetic energy and, an instant later, release a small amount of energy of a different wavelength. This change in wavelength causes a temporary color change of the mineral in the eye of an observer. The color change of fluorescent minerals is most spectacular when the minerals are placed in darkness and exposed to electromagnetic energy shorter than visible light.\
 \
 A former zinc mine in New Jersey is one of the most famous sources of fluorescent minerals in the entire world. Zincite and willemite were two of the zinc ores mined there. It was later discovered that more than 91 minerals in this region displayed fluorescence under shortwave electromagnetic energy.\
 \
 Mineral | Hardness | Color Under Visible Light | “Fluorescent” Color | Composition\
 Calcite | 3 | clear-white-variable | bright orange | CaCO3\
 Celestine | 3 to 3.5 | colorless-variable | yellow and/or white/blue | SrSO4\
 Willemite | 5.5 | pink-tan | bright green | Zn2SiO4\
 Zincite | 4 | yellow-orange | yellow | ZnO\
The mineral zincite will scratch\
(1) calcite, but will not scratch celestine and willemite\
 (2) willemite, but will not scratch calcite and celestine\
 (3) calcite and celestine, but will not scratch willemite\
 (4) willemite and celestine, but will not scratch calcite\

 \
 The Rise of the Khmer Rouge\
 . . . Growing to an army of hundreds of thousands, the Khmer Rouge pushed across the countryside. They captured the capital, Phnom Penh, and took power in 1975. The soldiers, wearing black pajama-like uniforms, forced nearly 2 million Cambodians out of the cities and into the countryside. Their goal was to remove foreign influence in Cambodia and turn everyone into a simple worker or farmer.\
 During the evacuation, thousands died. Starvation and disease killed many while execution practically became a science. The Khmer Rouge death list included those in the opposing regime, intellectuals, doctors, and teachers. Even people wearing glasses were executed simply because they were considered part of the upper or business classes. Ethnic minorities such as Cham, Chinese, Vietnamese, Thai, and Lao were targeted. Not considered “pure,” many were accused of supporting American imperialism or of nothing more than living in what was called the “enemy zone.”. . .\

 A Dream of Mountaineering\
 The following poem was written by a revered 8th century Chinese poet (701–762 AD)\
 \
 At night, in my dream, I stoutly climbed a mountain, \
 Going out alone with my staff of holly-wood. (staff of holly-wood - a walking stick)\
 A thousand crags, a hundred hundred valleys— \
 In my dream-journey none were unexplored \
 (line 5) And all the while my feet never grew tired \
 And my step was as strong as in my young days. \
 Can it be that when the mind travels backward \
 The body also returns to its old state? \
 And can it be, as between body and soul,\
 (line 10) That the body may languish, while the soul is still strong? \
 Soul and body—both are vanities: (vanities -superficial things)\
 Dreaming and waking—both alike unreal. \
 In the day my feet are palsied (palsied - shaking) and tottering; \
 In the night my steps go striding over the hills.\
 (line 15) As day and night are divided in equal parts— \
 Between the two, I get as much as I lose. \

 “There is no fundamental contradiction between socialism and a market economy. The problem is how to develop the productive forces more effectively. We used to have a planned economy, but our experience over the years has proved that having a totally planned economy hampers the development of the productive forces to a certain extent. If we combine a planned economy with a market economy, we shall be in a better position to liberate the productive forces and speed up economic growth.”…\

Clash of the Condiments: Wasabi vs. the Chili Pepper\
 by Mary Beth Cox\
 \
 Most condiments are peaceable enough. The sauces, spreads, and pickles of the world\
 add flavor to our foods without kicking up much of a fuss. This is not true of the pungent\
 or “hot’’ condiments. They are more aggressive. They get our attention by purposely\
 causing us pain. These strong-armed seasonings are often the source of friendly\
 (line 5) competitions. Loyal fans will contend that their favorite pungent condiment is the one that\
 packs the most powerful punch. Ladies and gentlemen, you are cordially welcomed to just\
 such a contest. Here it is, the Match of the Moment: Wasabi vs. the Chili Pepper.\
 IN YOUR CORNERS\
 Introducing in the Green Corner, hailing from the island nation of Japan, sushi’s\
 inseparable sidekick: Wasabi! Wasabia japonica grows wild on the cool, damp banks of\
 (line 10) Japan’s many mountain streams. The chill of its habitat is quite ironic since wasabi is\
 famous for bringing the heat. The plant is a botanical relative of mustard and horseradish.\
 Pungency runs in the family. Traditionally, wasabi is prepared by grating its rootstock on\
 the abrasive skin of an angel shark. Authentic wasabi is relatively rare and difficult to\
 come by. The emerald condiment that is served outside of Japan is almost always\
 (line 15) horseradish pulp dyed with green food coloring. Whether the wasabi is real or whether it’s\
 the more common substitute, a whopping snootful will make you cry for your momma!\
 And in the red corner, originating from the Central and South Americas, now an\
 international culinary superstar: the Chili Pepper. Chili peppers are fruits of the plants of\
 the botanical genus Capsicum. They are related to the tomato and the eggplant. They’re\
 (line 20) the renegades in an otherwise mild-mannered botanical family. Chili peppers include but\
 are not limited to the poblano, the cayenne, the jalapeño, the tabasco, the habanero, and\
 the serrano. One of these culprits sometimes goes by the alias “chipotle.’’ A chipotle\
 (pronounced chee-POHT-lay) is none other than a dried smoked jalape ño. Chilies were\
 introduced to the non-American world by Christopher Columbus, who mistakenly\
 (line 25) identified them as variants of black pepper. Chilies have since taken the culinary world by\
 storm. They appear alongside dishes served around the globe, from the Basque provinces\
 to North Africa and the Middle East, to India and Southeast Asia. A potent chili pepper in\
 the kisser will make you rue the day you were born!\
 POWERFUL PUNCHES\
 Both wasabi and chilies are condiments of world-class pungency. But how do they\
 (line 30) match up head to head? Each has its own unique tactical move. Each has its own special\
 point of attack. The active ingredient of the wasabi plant is stored stealthily in its cells.\
 Under normal growing conditions, this ingredient is completely harmless. It’s not until the\
 plant’s cells are ruptured (as by the grating action of angel shark skin) that the trouble\
 begins. Enzymes convert the ingredient into molecules of allyl isothiocyanate. It’s the\
 (line 35) chemical characteristics of these irritating molecules that are the secret to wasabi’s\
 pungency. Allyl isothiocyanate molecules are lightweight. They are volatile. They are also\
 soluble in water. As a consequence, the consumption of wasabi launches an airborne\
 assault on the consumer’s sinuses. Allyl isothiocyanate molecules waft up the nose and\
 back of the throat. They dissolve in the watery fluids they find there. They intercept nerve\
 (line 40) endings in the nasal passages. Specifically, these molecules target pain receptors of the\
 type known as TRPA I . TRPA I receptors respond to the attack by sending emergency\
 signals to the brain: “Yikes . . . we’ve gotten hold of something painfully hot!’’\
 Chili peppers conduct operations of a different sort. Their active ingredient is a\
 substance called capsaicin. It’s found in the spongy inner tissue of peppers, but it can leak\
 (line 45) onto the seeds and inner wall of the fruit. Capsaicin molecules are heavier than the\
 molecules of wasabi’s allyl isothiocyanate. They are not volatile. They prefer to dissolve in\
 oils, so they aren’t as easily dissolved in water. Capsaicin molecules instigate an incendiary\
 assault upon contact with exposed vulnerable surfaces. They cling to the tender tissues of\
 the lips, mouth, and throat. They burn eyes that are rubbed with capsaicin-laced fingers.\
 (line 50) Capsaicin molecules interact with pain receptors of the type TRPV I. Again an alert is\
 expedited to the brain: “Mayday! Mayday! Let’s not eat any more of that, please!’’\
 WHERE’S THE REFEREE?\
 So which of these condiments causes the most pain? To settle any contest, a scoring\
 system is required. There is a way to compare the relative heat intensities of the various\
 chili peppers. It’s called the Scoville scale. Scoville ratings are determined by brave human\
 (line 55) test subjects who willingly sip extracts of chili pepper juice. Extracted juices are diluted\
 again and again until their heat can no longer be detected. A high rating on the Scoville\
 scale means that a lot of dilutions are necessary to eliminate the pain caused by a\
 particular pepper. Unfortunately, Scoville ratings are not applicable to wasabi. The method\
 is specifically designed to extract capsaicin from chili peppers. It doesn’t work for allyl\
 (line 60) isothiocyanate, or for anything else.\
 Pepper pungencies are also compared by using chromatography. Chromatography is an\
 analytical technique that separates the chemical components of a mixture. After\
 separation, the amounts of each component are quantified. Chromatography can\
 determine how much capsaicin is in a pepper. It can also determine how much allyl\
 (line 65) isothiocyanate is in wasabi. If two chili peppers have the same amount of capsaicin, it can\
 be assumed that those peppers are equally “hot.’’ But the same assumption cannot be made\
 when comparing chili peppers to wasabi. There’s no way to know if equal amounts of\
 capsaicin and allyl isothiocyanate cause equal degrees of pain. So chromatography cannot\
 definitively judge this contest.\
 (line 70) It isn’t even possible to directly measure and compare nerve responses, since\
 two different types of pain receptors are involved. Wasabi and chili peppers are like\
 pungent apples and oranges. There’s no objective way to declare one more potent than the\
 other. This friendly competition won’t be settled anytime soon. Everyone is free to chime\
 in with an opinion. You just have to try both of these pungent powerhouses, then root for\
 (line 75) your own favorite flavor of pain.\
Read lines 25 and 26 from the article.\
 Chilies have since taken the culinary world by storm.\
 Which detail best supports the author’s claim?\
(A) Chili peppers come in many varieties.\
 (B) Chili peppers are used in many different countries.\
 (C) Chili peppers are related to tomatoes and eggplants.\
 (D) Chili peppers were mistakenly thought to resemble black pepper.\

Reading Comprehension Passage A\
 \
 …It was so cold that his first breath turned to iron in his throat, the hairs in his nostrils\
 webbed into instant ice, his eyes stung and watered. In the faint starlight and the bluish\
 luminescence of the snow everything beyond a few yards away swam deceptive and without\
 depth, glimmering with things half seen or imagined. Beside the dead car he stood with his\
 (line 5) head bent, listening, and there was not a sound. Everything on the planet might have died\
 in the cold. …\
 \
 But here he stood in light overcoat and thin leather gloves, without overshoes, and his\
 car all but blocked the road, and the door could not be locked, and there was not a\
 possibility that he could carry the heavy cases with him to the next farm or village. He\
 (line 10) switched on the headlights again and studied the roadside they revealed, and saw a rail\
 fence, with cedars and spruces behind it. When more complex gadgets and more complex\
 cures failed, there was always the lucifer match (lucifer match — a match that ignites through friction).\
 \
 Ten minutes later he was sitting with the auto robe over his head and shoulders and his\
 back against the plowed snowbank, digging the half melted snow from inside his shoes and\
 (line 15) gloating over the growing light and warmth of the fire. He had a supply of fence rails good\
 for an hour. In that time, someone would come along and he could get a push or a tow. In\
 this country, in winter, no one ever passed up a stranded motorist. …\
 \
 Abruptly he did not want to wait in that lonely snow-banked ditch any longer. The\
 sample cases (sample cases — cases of medicine samples) could look after themselves, any motorist who passed could take his own\
 (line 20) chances. He would walk ahead to the nearest help, and if he found himself getting too cold\
 on the way, he could always build another fire. The thought of action cheered him; he\
 admitted to himself that he was all but terrified at the silence and the iron cold. …\
 \
 Turning with the road, he passed through the stretch of woods and came into the open\
 to see the moon-white, shadow-black buildings of a farm, and the weak bloom of light in a\
 (line 25) window. …\
 \
 “Hello?” he said, and knocked again. “Anybody home?” No sound answered him. He\
 saw the moon glint on the great icicles along the eaves. His numb hand ached with the pain\
 of knocking; he pounded with the soft edge of his fist.\
 \
 Answer finally came, not from the door before which he stood, but from the barn, down\
 (line 30) at the end of a staggered string of attached sheds. A door creaked open against a snowbank\
 and a figure with a lantern appeared, stood for a moment, and came running. The traveler\
 wondered at the way it came, lurching and stumbling in the uneven snow, until it arrived at\
 the porch and he saw that it was a boy of eleven or twelve. The boy set his lantern on the\
 porch; between the upturned collar of his mackinaw (mackinaw — type of warm coat) and the down-pulled stocking cap his\
 (line 35) face was a pinched whiteness, his eyes enormous. He stared at the traveler until the traveler\
 became aware of the blanket he still held over head and shoulders, and began to laugh.\
 \
 “My car stopped on me, a mile or so up the road,” he said. “I was just hunting a\
 telephone or some place where I could get help.”\
 \
 The boy swallowed, wiped the back of his mitt across his nose. “Grandpa’s sick!” he\
 (line 40) blurted, and opened the door. …\
 \
 “He must’ve had a shock,” the boy said. “I came in from chores and he was on the floor.”\
 He stared at the mummy under the quilt, and he swallowed. …\
 \
 “Why didn’t you go for help?”\
 \
 The boy looked down, ashamed. “It’s near two miles. I was afraid he’d.…”\
 \
 (line 45) “But you left him. You were out in the barn.”\
 \
 “I was hitching up to go,” the boy said. “I’d made up my mind.”\
 \
 The traveler backed away from the stove, his face smarting (smarting — stinging) with the heat, his fingers\
 and feet beginning to ache. He looked at the old man and knew that here, as at the car, he\
 was helpless. The boy’s thin anxious face told him how thoroughly his own emergency had\
 (line 50) been swallowed up in this other one. He had been altered from a man in need of help to\
 one who must give it. Salesman of wonder cures, he must now produce something to calm\
 this over-worried boy, restore a dying man. Rebelliously, victimized by circumstances, he\
 said, “Where were you going for help?”\
 \
 “The Hill place. They’ve got a phone.”\
 \
 (line 55) “How far are they from a town?”\
 \
 “About five miles.”\
 \
 “Doctor there?”\
 \
 “Yes.”\
 \
 “If I took your horse and—what is it, sleigh?—could someone at the Hills’ bring them\
 (line 60) back, do you think?”\
 \
 “Cutter (cutter — a small horse-drawn sled). One of the Hill boys could, I should say.”\
 \
 “Or would you rather go, while I look after your Grandpa?”\
 \
 “He don’t know you,” the boy said directly. “If he should wake up he might … wonder\
 … it might.…”\
 \
 (line 65) The traveler grudgingly gave up the prospect of staying in the warm kitchen while the\
 boy did the work. And he granted that it was extraordinarily sensitive of the boy to know\
 how it might disturb a man to wake from sickness in his own house and stare into the face\
 of an utter stranger. “Yes,” he said. “Well, I could call the doctor from the Hills’. Two miles,\
 did you say?” …\
 \
 (line 70) He climbed into the cutter and pulled over his lap the balding buffalo robe he found\
 there; the scallop (scallop — curve) of its felt edges was like a key that fitted a door. The horses breathed jets\
 of steam in the moonlight, restlessly moving, jingling their harness bells, as the moment\
 lengthened itself. The traveler saw how the boy, now that his anxiety was somewhat quieted,\
 now that he had been able to unload part of his burden, watched him with a thousand\
 (line 75) questions in his face, and he remembered how he himself, thirty years ago, had searched\
 the faces of passing strangers for something he could not name, how he had listened to their\
 steps and seen their shadows lengthen ahead of them down roads that led to unimaginable\
 places, and how he had ached with the desire to know them, who they were. But none of\
 them had looked back at him as he tried now to look at this boy. …\
 \
 (line 80) For half a breath he was utterly bewitched, frozen at the heart of some icy dream.\
 Abruptly he slapped the reins across the backs of the horses; the cutter jerked and then slid\
 smoothly out toward the road. The traveler looked back once, to fix forever the picture of\
 himself standing silently watching himself go. As he slid into the road the horses broke into\
 a trot. The icy flow of air locked his throat and made him let go the reins with one hand to\
 (line 85) pull the hairy, wool-smelling edge of the blanket all but shut across his face.\
 \
 Along a road he had never driven he went swiftly toward an unknown farm and an\
 unknown town, to distribute according to some wise law part of the burden of the boy’s\
 emergency and his own; but he bore (bore — carried) in his mind, bright as moonlight over snow, a vivid\
 wonder, almost an awe. For from that most chronic and incurable of ills, identity, he had\
 (line 90) looked outward and for one unmistakable instant recognized himself.\

Excerpt from Wheels of Change: How Women Rode the Bicycle to Freedom (With a Few Flat Tires Along the Way)\
 by Sue Macy\
 \
 (paragraph 1) Women’s rights crusader Elizabeth Cady Stanton was in her eighties during the\
 heyday of the bicycle, and no evidence exists to show that she actually ever rode one.\
 But there was no better or more eloquent advocate for women and the wheel. In 1895,\
 Stanton contributed an article to the American Wheelman celebrating this “wonderful\
 new style of locomotion.” In the article, titled “The Era of the Bicycle,” she pointed out\
 that cycling was increasing people’s mobility, eliminating the cost of feeding and\
 housing horses, and encouraging the building of good roads. However, she saved her\
 greatest praise for the bicycle’s effects on women. “The bicycle,” she wrote, “will inspire\
 women with more courage, self-respect and self-reliance and make the next generation\
 more vigorous of mind and of body; for feeble mothers do not produce great\
 statesmen, scientists and scholars.”\
 (paragraph 2) For all the practical benefits of the two-wheeler, the fact is that it brought about a\
 cosmic shift in women’s private and public lives. With the rise of industry and the\
 move from a rural to an urban economy in the 19th century, American women had\
 become increasingly confined to their homes. Young girls could play outside, but when\
 they matured, their freedom of movement was greatly restricted. “At sixteen years of\
 age, I was enwrapped in the long skirts that impeded every footstep,” remembered\
 Frances Willard, who in 1895 wrote a best-selling account of how she learned to ride a\
 bicycle at age 53. “I have detested walking and felt with a certain noble disdain that the\
 conventions of life had cut me off from what . . . had been one of life’s sweetest joys.”\
 (paragraph 3) While wealthier women were saddled with long skirts and restrictive corsets, those\
 who were less well off worked anonymously in mills and factories. All in all, the result\
 was the same. Except in a few instances, the public image of America was male.\
 Politicians, soldiers, business leaders, and even the leading athletes in the new sports of\
 baseball and football were all men. But the bicycle changed that. Suddenly, women\
 were leaving their homes to cycle and socialize on country roads and city streets.\
 Bicycle racers such as Louise Armaindo and Frankie Nelson had their exploits splashed\
 all over the papers. Bicycle manufacturers, intent on mining an untapped market,\
 showed female models in their advertisements. Thanks to the wheel, women were\
 starting to be seen and heard in public life.\
 (paragraph 4) It was not a stretch for some cyclists to see the possibility of a larger role for women\
 in the world. When she conquered the wheel, Frances Willard was a former university\
 president and the longtime president of the Woman’s Christian Temperance Union,\
 which fought to prohibit the use of alcoholic beverages and to win women the right to\
 vote. Willard saw parallels between learning to ride and learning to live. “I began to feel\
 that myself plus the bicycle equaled myself plus the world, upon whose spinning wheel\
 we must all learn to ride,” she wrote. “He who succeeds, or, to be more exact in handing\
 over my experience, she who succeeds in gaining the mastery of [a bicycle], will gain\
 the mastery of life.”\
 (paragraph 5) For decades, Willard, along with Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Susan B. Anthony, and\
 many others, had been working toward increased political and economic rights for\
 women. Now the bicycle brought a taste of independence to women on a very personal\
 level, and some of them took the opportunity to express their discontent with old\
 traditions and expectations. In August 1895, a cyclist named Ann Strong caused a stir\
 when she compared the value of a bicycle to that of a husband in the Minneapolis\
 Tribune. “I can’t see but that a wheel is just as good company as most husbands,” she\
 declared. “I would as lief (lief: happily) talk to one inanimate object as another; and I’d a great deal\
 rather talk to one that can’t answer than one that won’t.” Strong then contrasted the joy\
 of cycling with the challenges of raising a family. “You can make your wheel tidy over\
 night,” she said, “and it never kicks off its shoes the very last minute, and never smears\
 itself with molasses. When you are ready you can start. No little elbows are stuck in\
 your ribs; there is no wiggling; screams at the cars or at the candy stores. You glide\
 along, silently, smoothly, swiftly.”\
 (paragraph 6) Some stated the liberating effects of the bicycle with less sarcasm. “The bicycle has\
 brought to women a healthful, wholesome means of securing a degree of freedom and\
 independence that no amount of discussion regarding ‘women’s rights’ would ever\
 have produced,” wrote the L.A.W. Bulletin and Good Roads magazine in 1898.\
 Meanwhile, Munsey’s Magazine assessed the impact of the wheel on women in a\
 special bicycle-themed issue. “If she has ridden her bicycle into new fields, becoming in\
 the process a new creature, it has been gradually and unconsciously,” the editors wrote.\
 (paragraph 7) “She did not have to be born again in some mysterious fashion, becoming a strange\
 creature, a ‘new woman.’ She is more like the ‘eternal feminine,’ who has taken on\
 wings, and who is using them with an ever increasing delight in her new power.”\
 Indeed, many bicycle companies at home and abroad did put wings on the women in\
 their advertisements, emphasizing that they had taken flight.\
 (paragraph 8) Not all publications treated the emergence of the “new woman” with the same level\
 of approval. Some mocked her, while others just seemed baffled by her. Her new way of\
 dressing, in bloomers or divided skirts or skirts with shortened hems, certainly\
 disturbed the old social order, but so did her confidence and daring. These traits led\
 commentators to worry that the differences between the sexes were being blurred, a\
 fear that was reinforced as the four newest states—Wyoming, Colorado, Utah, and\
 Idaho—granted women the right to vote in the 1890s. Would the bicycle help bring\
 about a new kind of equality between men and women? Elizabeth Cady Stanton and\
 her colleagues certainly hoped so. At any rate, the image of a female cyclist quickly\
 became associated with efforts to win more rights for women.\

 “At sixteen years of age, I was enwrapped in the long skirts that impeded every footstep,” remembered Frances Willard, who in 1895 wrote a best-selling account of how she learned to ride a bicycle at age 53.\

Reading Comprehension Passage A\
 \
 The factory made the best centrifugal pumps in the world, and Merle Waggoner owned\
 it. He’d started it. He’d just been offered two million dollars for it by the General Forge and\
 Foundry Company. He didn’t have any stockholders and he didn’t owe a dime. He was\
 fifty-one, a widower, and he had one heir—a son. The boy’s name was Franklin. The boy\
 (line 5) was named after Benjamin Franklin.\
 \
 One Friday afternoon father and son came out of Merle’s office and into the factory.\
 They went down a factory aisle to Rudy Linberg’s lathe. (lathe — a machine on which a piece of material, such as wood or metal, is spun and shaped against a fixed\
 cutting tool)\
 \
 “Rudy,” said Merle, “the boy here’s home from college for three days, and I thought\
 maybe you and him and your boy and me might go out to the farm and shoot some clay\
 (line 10) pigeons tomorrow.”\
 \
 Rudy turned his sky-blue eyes to Merle and young Franklin. He was Merle’s age, and\
 he had the deep and narrow dignity of a man who had learned his limitations early—who\
 had never tried to go beyond them. His limitations were those of his tools, his flute and his\
 shotgun. …\
 \
 (line 15) “Let’s go ask my boy what he’s got on tomorrow,” said Rudy. It was a formality. Karl\
 always did what his father wanted him to do—did it with profound love. …\
 \
 Karl was a carbon copy of his father. He was such a good mimic of Rudy that his joints\
 seemed to ache a little with age. He seemed sobered by fifty-one years of life, though he’d\
 lived only twenty. He seemed instinctively wary of safety hazards that had been eliminated\
 (line 20) from the factory by the time he’d learned to walk. Karl stood at attention without humility,\
 just as his father had done.\
 \
 “Want to go shooting tomorrow?” said Rudy.\
 “Shoot what?” said Karl.\
 “Crows. Clay pigeons,” said Rudy. “Maybe a woodchuck.”\
 \
 (line 25)“Don’t mind,” said Karl. He nodded briefly to Merle and Franklin. “Glad to.” …\
 Rudy nodded. He examined the work in Karl’s lathe and tapped his own temple. The\
 tapping was a signal that Franklin had seen many times on hunts. It meant that Karl was\
 doing fine.\
 \
 Rudy touched Karl’s elbow lightly. It was the signal for Karl to get back to work. Rudy\
 (line 30) and Karl each held up a crooked finger and saluted with it. Franklin knew what that meant\
 too. It meant, “Good-by, I love you.” …\
 \
 Merle was sitting at his desk, his head down, when Franklin came in. He held a steel\
 plate about six inches square in his left hand. In the middle of the plate was a hole two inches\
 square. In his right hand he held a steel cube that fitted the hole exactly. …\
 \
 (line 35) Franklin sat down gingerly on a hard chair by the wall. The office hadn’t changed much\
 in the years he’d known it. It was one more factory room, with naked pipes overhead—the\
 cold ones sweaty, the hot ones dry. Wires snaked from steel box to steel box. The green walls\
 and cream trim were as rough as elephant hide in some places, with alternating coats of\
 paint and grime, paint and grime.\
 \
 (line 40) There had never been time to scrape away the layers, and barely enough time,\
 overnight, to slap on new paint. And there had never been time in which to finish the rough\
 shelves that lined the room. …\
 \
 Merle slipped the cube through the square hole once more. “Know what these are?” he\
 said.\
 \
 (line 45) “Yes, sir,” said Franklin. “They’re what Rudy Linberg had to make when he was an\
 apprentice in Sweden.”\
 The cube could be slipped through the hole in twenty-four different ways, without\
 letting the tiniest ray of light pass through with it.\
 \
 “Unbelievable skill,” said Franklin respectfully. “There aren’t craftsmen like that\
 (line 50) coming along any more.” He didn’t really feel much respect. He was simply saying what he\
 knew his father wanted to hear. The cube and the hole struck him as criminal wastes of time\
 and great bores. “Unbelievable,” he said again.\
 \
 “It’s utterly unbelievable, when you realize that Rudy didn’t make them,” said Merle\
 gravely, “when you realize what generation the man who made them belongs to.”\
 \
 (line 55) “Oh?” said Franklin. “Who did make them?”\
 \
 “Rudy’s boy, Karl,” said Merle. “A member of your generation.” He ground out his cigar\
 sadly. “He gave them to me on my last birthday. They were on my desk, boy, waiting for me\
 when I came in—right beside the ones Rudy gave me thirty-one years before.” …\
 \
 “I could have cried, boy, when I saw those two plates and those two cubes side by side,”\
 (line 60) said Merle. “Can you understand that?” he asked beseechingly. “Can you understand why\
 I’d feel like crying?” …\
 \
 “The cube of Karl’s fitted through the hole of Rudy’s!” said Merle. “They were\
 interchangeable!”\
 \
 “Gosh!” said Franklin. “I’ll be darned. Really?”\
 \
 (line 65) And now he felt like crying, because he didn’t care, couldn’t care—and would have\
 given his right arm to care. The factory whanged and banged and screeched in monstrous\
 irrelevance—Franklin’s, all Franklin’s, if he just said the word.\
 \
 “What’ll you do with it—buy a theater in New York?” said Merle abruptly.\
 \
 “Do with what, sir?” said Franklin.\
 \
 (line 70) “The money I’ll get for the factory when I sell it—the money I’ll leave to you when I’m\
 dead,” said Merle. He hit the word “dead” hard. “What’s Waggoner Pump going to be\
 converted into? Waggoner Theaters? Waggoner School of Acting? The Waggoner Home for\
 Broken-Down Actors?”\
 \
 “I—I hadn’t thought about it,” said Franklin. The idea of converting Waggoner Pump\
 (line 75) into something equally complicated hadn’t occurred to him, and appalled him now. He was\
 being asked to match his father’s passion for the factory with an equal passion for something\
 else. And Franklin had no such passion—for the theater or anything else. …\
 \
 “Don’t sell on my account,” said Franklin wretchedly.\
 \
 “On whose account would I keep it?” said Merle.\
 \
 (line 80) “Do you have to sell it today?” said Franklin, horrified.\
 \
 “Strike while the iron’s hot, I always say,” said Merle. “Today’s the day you decided to\
 be an actor, and, as luck would have it, we have an excellent offer for what I did with my\
 life.”\
 \
 “Couldn’t we wait?”\
 \
 (line 85) “For what?” said Merle. He was having a good time now.\
 \
 “Father!” cried Franklin. “For the love of heaven, father, please!” He hung his head and\
 shook it. “I don’t know what I’m doing,” he said brokenly. “I don’t know for sure what I want\
 to do yet. I’m just playing with ideas, trying to find myself. Please, father, don’t sell what\
 you’ve done with your life, don’t just throw it away because I’m not sure I want to do that\
 (line 90) with my life too! Please!” Franklin looked up. “I’m not Karl Linberg,” he said. “I can’t help\
 it. I’m sorry, but I’m not Karl Linberg.” …\

Reading Comprehension Passage A\
 \
 …It was so cold that his first breath turned to iron in his throat, the hairs in his nostrils\
 webbed into instant ice, his eyes stung and watered. In the faint starlight and the bluish\
 luminescence of the snow everything beyond a few yards away swam deceptive and without\
 depth, glimmering with things half seen or imagined. Beside the dead car he stood with his\
 (line 5) head bent, listening, and there was not a sound. Everything on the planet might have died\
 in the cold. …\
 \
 But here he stood in light overcoat and thin leather gloves, without overshoes, and his\
 car all but blocked the road, and the door could not be locked, and there was not a\
 possibility that he could carry the heavy cases with him to the next farm or village. He\
 (line 10) switched on the headlights again and studied the roadside they revealed, and saw a rail\
 fence, with cedars and spruces behind it. When more complex gadgets and more complex\
 cures failed, there was always the lucifer match (lucifer match — a match that ignites through friction).\
 \
 Ten minutes later he was sitting with the auto robe over his head and shoulders and his\
 back against the plowed snowbank, digging the half melted snow from inside his shoes and\
 (line 15) gloating over the growing light and warmth of the fire. He had a supply of fence rails good\
 for an hour. In that time, someone would come along and he could get a push or a tow. In\
 this country, in winter, no one ever passed up a stranded motorist. …\
 \
 Abruptly he did not want to wait in that lonely snow-banked ditch any longer. The\
 sample cases (sample cases — cases of medicine samples) could look after themselves, any motorist who passed could take his own\
 (line 20) chances. He would walk ahead to the nearest help, and if he found himself getting too cold\
 on the way, he could always build another fire. The thought of action cheered him; he\
 admitted to himself that he was all but terrified at the silence and the iron cold. …\
 \
 Turning with the road, he passed through the stretch of woods and came into the open\
 to see the moon-white, shadow-black buildings of a farm, and the weak bloom of light in a\
 (line 25) window. …\
 \
 “Hello?” he said, and knocked again. “Anybody home?” No sound answered him. He\
 saw the moon glint on the great icicles along the eaves. His numb hand ached with the pain\
 of knocking; he pounded with the soft edge of his fist.\
 \
 Answer finally came, not from the door before which he stood, but from the barn, down\
 (line 30) at the end of a staggered string of attached sheds. A door creaked open against a snowbank\
 and a figure with a lantern appeared, stood for a moment, and came running. The traveler\
 wondered at the way it came, lurching and stumbling in the uneven snow, until it arrived at\
 the porch and he saw that it was a boy of eleven or twelve. The boy set his lantern on the\
 porch; between the upturned collar of his mackinaw (mackinaw — type of warm coat) and the down-pulled stocking cap his\
 (line 35) face was a pinched whiteness, his eyes enormous. He stared at the traveler until the traveler\
 became aware of the blanket he still held over head and shoulders, and began to laugh.\
 \
 “My car stopped on me, a mile or so up the road,” he said. “I was just hunting a\
 telephone or some place where I could get help.”\
 \
 The boy swallowed, wiped the back of his mitt across his nose. “Grandpa’s sick!” he\
 (line 40) blurted, and opened the door. …\
 \
 “He must’ve had a shock,” the boy said. “I came in from chores and he was on the floor.”\
 He stared at the mummy under the quilt, and he swallowed. …\
 \
 “Why didn’t you go for help?”\
 \
 The boy looked down, ashamed. “It’s near two miles. I was afraid he’d.…”\
 \
 (line 45) “But you left him. You were out in the barn.”\
 \
 “I was hitching up to go,” the boy said. “I’d made up my mind.”\
 \
 The traveler backed away from the stove, his face smarting (smarting — stinging) with the heat, his fingers\
 and feet beginning to ache. He looked at the old man and knew that here, as at the car, he\
 was helpless. The boy’s thin anxious face told him how thoroughly his own emergency had\
 (line 50) been swallowed up in this other one. He had been altered from a man in need of help to\
 one who must give it. Salesman of wonder cures, he must now produce something to calm\
 this over-worried boy, restore a dying man. Rebelliously, victimized by circumstances, he\
 said, “Where were you going for help?”\
 \
 “The Hill place. They’ve got a phone.”\
 \
 (line 55) “How far are they from a town?”\
 \
 “About five miles.”\
 \
 “Doctor there?”\
 \
 “Yes.”\
 \
 “If I took your horse and—what is it, sleigh?—could someone at the Hills’ bring them\
 (line 60) back, do you think?”\
 \
 “Cutter (cutter — a small horse-drawn sled). One of the Hill boys could, I should say.”\
 \
 “Or would you rather go, while I look after your Grandpa?”\
 \
 “He don’t know you,” the boy said directly. “If he should wake up he might … wonder\
 … it might.…”\
 \
 (line 65) The traveler grudgingly gave up the prospect of staying in the warm kitchen while the\
 boy did the work. And he granted that it was extraordinarily sensitive of the boy to know\
 how it might disturb a man to wake from sickness in his own house and stare into the face\
 of an utter stranger. “Yes,” he said. “Well, I could call the doctor from the Hills’. Two miles,\
 did you say?” …\
 \
 (line 70) He climbed into the cutter and pulled over his lap the balding buffalo robe he found\
 there; the scallop (scallop — curve) of its felt edges was like a key that fitted a door. The horses breathed jets\
 of steam in the moonlight, restlessly moving, jingling their harness bells, as the moment\
 lengthened itself. The traveler saw how the boy, now that his anxiety was somewhat quieted,\
 now that he had been able to unload part of his burden, watched him with a thousand\
 (line 75) questions in his face, and he remembered how he himself, thirty years ago, had searched\
 the faces of passing strangers for something he could not name, how he had listened to their\
 steps and seen their shadows lengthen ahead of them down roads that led to unimaginable\
 places, and how he had ached with the desire to know them, who they were. But none of\
 them had looked back at him as he tried now to look at this boy. …\
 \
 (line 80) For half a breath he was utterly bewitched, frozen at the heart of some icy dream.\
 Abruptly he slapped the reins across the backs of the horses; the cutter jerked and then slid\
 smoothly out toward the road. The traveler looked back once, to fix forever the picture of\
 himself standing silently watching himself go. As he slid into the road the horses broke into\
 a trot. The icy flow of air locked his throat and made him let go the reins with one hand to\
 (line 85) pull the hairy, wool-smelling edge of the blanket all but shut across his face.\
 \
 Along a road he had never driven he went swiftly toward an unknown farm and an\
 unknown town, to distribute according to some wise law part of the burden of the boy’s\
 emergency and his own; but he bore (bore — carried) in his mind, bright as moonlight over snow, a vivid\
 wonder, almost an awe. For from that most chronic and incurable of ills, identity, he had\
 (line 90) looked outward and for one unmistakable instant recognized himself.\

 Copy Cat\
 In February 2002, Cc - the first-ever cloned cat - was introduced to the public by researchers at Texas A&M University. The kitten had been born December 22, 2001, but announcement of the successful cloning was delayed until the animal had completed its shot series and its immune system was fully developed. In the cloning process, DNA [the nucleus] was transplanted from the 2-year-old donor mother cat into an egg cell whose nucleus had been removed. This embryo then was implanted into the surrogate mother cat. …\

If a donor cat was black and the surrogate mother was white, then the cloned cat would likely be\
(1) white, due to the color of the surrogate mother cat\
 (2) white, due to mutations of the cloned cat\
 (3) black, due to having the same DNA as the donor cat\
 (4) black and white, due to mixing of the genes of the two cats during the cloning process\

 \
 Excerpt from The Midnight Fox\
 by Betsy Byars\
 (paragraph 1) I had just finished writing this letter and was waiting for a minute to see if I would think of anything to add when I looked up and saw the black fox.\
 (paragraph 2) I did not believe it for a minute. It was like my eyes were playing a trick or something, because I was just sort of staring across this field, thinking about my letter, and then in the distance, where the grass was very green, I saw a fox leaping over the crest of the field. The grass moved and the fox sprang toward the movement, and then, seeing that it was just the wind that had caused the grass to move, she ran straight for the grove of trees where I was sitting\
 (paragraph 3) It was so great that I wanted it to start over again, like you can turn movie film back and see yourself repeat some fine thing you have done, and I wanted to see the fox leaping over the grass again. In all my life I have never been so excited.\
 (paragraph 4) I did not move at all, but I could hear the paper in my hand shaking, and my heart seemed to have moved up in my body and got stuck in my throat.\
 (paragraph 5) The fox came straight toward the grove of trees. She wasn't afraid, and I knew she had not seen me against the tree. I stayed absolutely still even though I felt like jumping up and screaming, \"Aunt Millie! Uncle Fred! Come see this. It's a fox, a fox!\"\
 (paragraph 6) Her steps as she crossed the field were lighter and quicker than a cat's. As she came closer I could see that her black fur was tipped with white. It was as if it were midnight and the moon were shining on her fur, frosting it. The wind parted her fur as it changed directions. Suddenly she stopped. She was ten feet away now, and with the changing of the wind she had got my scent. She looked right at me.\
 (paragraph 7) I did not move for a moment and neither did she. Her head was cocked to one side, her tail curled up, her front left foot raised. In all my life I never saw anything like that fox standing there with her pale golden eyes on me and this great black fur being blown by the wind.\
 (paragraph 8) Suddenly her nose quivered. It was such a slight movement I almost didn't see it, and then her mouth opened and I could see the pink tip of her tongue. She turned. She still was not afraid, but with a bound that was lighter than the wind-it was as if she was being blown away over the field-she was gone.\
 (paragraph 9) Still I didn't move. I couldn't. I couldn't believe that I had really seen the fox.\
 (paragraph 10) I had seen foxes before in zoos, but I was always in such a great hurry to get on to the good stuff that I was saying stupid things like, \"I want to see the go-rilllllas\", and not once had I ever really looked at a fox. Still, I could never remember seeing a black fox, not even in a zoo.\
 (paragraph 11) Also, there was a great deal of difference between seeing an animal in the zoo in front of painted fake rocks and trees and seeing one natural and free in the woods. It was like seeing a kite on the floor and then, later, seeing one up in the sky where it was supposed to be, pulling at the wind.\
 (paragraph 12) I started to pick up my pencil and write as quickly as I could, \"P.S. Today I saw a black fox.\" But I didn't. This was the most exciting thing that had happened to me, and \"P.S. Today I saw a black fox\" made it nothing. \"So what else is happening?\" Petie Burkis would probably write back. I folded my letter, put it in an envelope, and sat there.\
 (paragraph 13) I thought about this old newspaper that my dad had had in his desk drawer for years. It was orange and the headline was just one word, very big, the letters about twelve inches high. WAR! And I mean it was awesome to see that word like that, because you knew it was a word that was going to change your whole life, the whole world even. And every time I would see that newspaper, even though I wasn't even born when it was printed, I couldn't say anything for a minute or two.\
 (paragraph 14) Well, this was the way I felt right then about the black fox. I thought about a newspaper with just one word for a headline, very big, very black letters, twelve inches high. FOX! And even that did not show how awesome it had really been to me.\
Based on paragraphs 13 and 14, how are the words \"WAR!\" and \"FOX!\" similar?\
(A) They inspire a powerful response in Tom.\
 (B) They provide Tom with a physical reminder.\
 (C) They help promote Tom's interest in writing.\
 (D) They create connections within Tom's family.\

Reading Comprehension Passage C\
 Many Animals Can Count, Some Better Than You\
 \
 Every night during breeding season, the male túngara frog of Central America will stake\
 out a performance patch in the local pond and spend unbroken hours broadcasting\
 his splendor to the world.\
 The mud-brown frog is barely the size of a shelled pecan, but his call is large and\
 (line 5) dynamic, a long downward sweep that sounds remarkably like a phaser weapon on\
 \"Star Trek,\" followed by a brief, twangy, harmonically dense chuck.(chuck - a clucking sound)\
 Unless, that is, a competing male starts calling nearby, in which case the first frog is\
 likely to add two chucks to the tail of his sweep. And should his rival respond likewise,\
 Male A will tack on three chucks.\
 (line 10) Back and forth they go, call and raise, until the frogs hit their respiratory limit at six\
 to seven rapid-fire chucks.\
 The acoustic one-upfrogship is energetically draining and risks attracting predators like\
 bats. Yet the male frogs have no choice but to keep count of the competition, for the simple\
 reason that female túngaras are doing the same: listening, counting and ultimately mating\
 (line 15) with the male of maximum chucks.\
 Behind the frog’s surprisingly sophisticated number sense, scientists have found, are\
 specialized cells in the amphibian midbrain that tally up sound signals and the intervals\
 between them.\
 \"The neurons are counting the number of appropriate pulses, and they’re highly\
 (line 20) selective,\" said Gary Rose, a biologist at the University of Utah. If the timing between\
 pulses is off by just a fraction of a second, the neurons don’t fire and the counting process\
 breaks down. …\
 Scientists have found that animals across the evolutionary spectrum have a keen sense\
 of quantity, able to distinguish not just bigger from smaller or more from less, but two from\
 (line 25) four, four from ten, forty from sixty.\
 Orb-weaving spiders, for example, keep a tally of how many silk-wrapped prey items are\
 stashed in the \"larder\" segment of their web. When scientists experimentally remove the\
 cache, the spiders will spend time searching for the stolen goods in proportion to how many\
 separate items had been taken, rather than how big the total prey mass might have been.\
 (line 30) Small fish benefit from living in schools, and the more numerous the group, the\
 statistically better a fish’s odds of escaping predation. As a result, many shoaling (shoaling - shallow water) fish are\
 excellent appraisers of relative head counts.\
 Guppies, for example, have a so-called contrast ratio of .8, which means they can\
 distinguish at a glance between four guppies and five, or eight guppies and ten, and if given\
 (line 35) the chance will swim toward the slightly fishier crowd.\
 Three-spined sticklebacks (sticklebacks - carnivorous fish) are more discriminating still: with a contrast ratio of .86,\
 they’re able to tell six fellow fish from seven, or 18 from 21 — a comparative power that\
 many birds, mammals and even humans might find hard to beat.\
 Despite the prevalence of math phobia, people too are born with a strong innate\
 (line 40) number sense, and numerosity is deeply embedded in many aspects of our minds and\
 culture.\
 Researchers have determined that number words for small quantities — less than five —\
 are strikingly similar across virtually every language studied, and the words are among the\
 most stable, unchanging utterances in any lexicon. (lexicon - language)\
 (line 45) They are more conserved through time and across cultures than words for other\
 presumably bedrock concepts like mother, father and most body parts, with a few puzzling\
 exceptions like the words for tongue and eye.\
 \"The sounds that you and I use to say ‘two’ or ‘three’ are the sounds that have been used\
 for tens of thousands of years,\" said Mark Pagel, a biologist who studies the evolution of\
 (line 50) language at the University of Reading.\
 \"It’s not out of the question that you could have been wandering around 15,000 years\
 ago and encountered a few of the last remaining Neanderthals, pointed to yourself and said,\
 ‘one,’ and pointed to them and said, ‘three,’ and those words, in an odd, coarse way, would\
 have been understood.\"\
 (line 55) That continuity, Dr. Pagel added, \"should astonish us.\" …\
 Attitudes about animal numerosity have changed dramatically since the mid-twentieth\
 century when many researchers believed only humans had enough gray matter to think\
 quantitatively. They cited as an object lesson the 1907 case of Clever Hans, the horse that\
 supposedly could solve arithmetic problems and would tap out his answers by hoof; as it\
 (line 60) turned out, he was responding to unconscious cues from the people around him.\
 Since then, researchers have approached the field with caution and rigor, seeking to\
 identify the specific evolutionary pressures that might spur the need for numeric judgments\
 in any given species.\
 Social carnivores like spotted hyenas, for example, live in fission-fusion societies, (fission-fusion societies - animals whose social group composition and size change as they move throughout their environment)\
 (line 65) collectively defending their territories against rivals but in ever-shifting groups of widely\
 roaming members. \"You can never predict who you’ll find in which group,\" said Sarah\
 Benson-Amram, an assistant professor of zoology and physiology at the University of\
 Wyoming. \"You might be alone or in a group of ten.\"\
 Because hyena jaws can pulverize zebra bones, encounters between [rival hyena]\
 (line 70) competitors can prove deadly; every spotted hyena must have a good sense from moment\
 to moment of how many there are of us versus how many of them. Dr. Benson-Amram and\
 her colleagues tested hyena numerosity skills in the field, playing back the recorded whoops\
 of spotted hyenas living in South Africa and Namibia to hyenas in Kenya.\
 The Kenyan carnivores reacted to the whoops of strangers as predicted, approaching\
 (line 75)\
 the hidden source of the sound when they had a home team advantage, retreating when\
 they heard a few too many distinctive voices in a row. Or sometimes, when the local hyenas\
 were outnumbered, they’d call for backup. …\
 Chimpanzees are social scorekeepers, episodic (episodic - periodic) warriors and number ninjas, too.\
 They can be taught to associate groups of objects with corresponding Arabic numerals up\
 (line 80) to the number 9 and sometimes beyond — three squares on a computer screen with the\
 number 3, five squares with 5, and so on. They can put those numerals in order.\
 The numeric working memory of young chimpanzees is astonishing: Flash a random\
 scattering of numerals on a screen for just 210 milliseconds — half an eye blink — and then\
 cover the numbers with white squares, and a numerically schooled young chimpanzee will\
 (line 85) touch the squares sequentially to indicate the ascending order of the numbers hidden\
 beneath.\
 Don’t bother trying to do this yourself, Tetsuro Matsuzawa, a primatologist at Kyoto\
 University, said at the scientific meeting in London on which the themed journal (the themed journal - a publication where animal numerosity studies were discussed) was based.\
 \"You can’t.\" …\
 (line 90) Stanislas Dehaene, a psychologist at the University of Paris, and his colleagues\
 presented evidence from brain scans of professional mathematicians that the neural\
 circuitry (neural circuitry - nerve cells) for advanced mathematical thinking is an elaboration on the archaic (archaic - primitive) number sense\
 we share with other animals. …\
 We hear that the price of something rose by 50 percent and then fell by 50 percent, and\
 (line 95) we reflexively, mistakenly conclude, \"Oh good, we’re back to where we started.\" Our natural\
 number sense adds and subtracts whole numbers, whole chucks, guppies and hyenas.\
 But it really abhors a fraction, and so has led us astray.\

This excerpt is from a book about the history of the Hudson River.\
 \
 Excerpt from River of Dreams\
 \
 by Hudson Talbott\
 \
 (paragraph 1) By the twentieth century, New York City had long since reached its destiny of becoming the most powerful city in America. In less than 300 years it had grown from a tiny Dutch outpost in the wilderness to the business capital of the world. It was a city built on dreams.\
 \
 (paragraph 2) But it was made out of bricks and cement that had come from the banks of the Hudson. The river which had fed all those dreams was now fading into the background. New York didn’t seem to need the river anymore, except as a sewer. And that’s what it became.\
 \
 (paragraph 3) Industry on the river had made some New Yorkers filthy rich. But it had just made the river filthy. Garbage, factory waste, plant chemicals and the raw sewage of the cities and towns along its banks were dumped directly into the river. The water turned greenish brown, except by the GM plant, where it turned red or yellow or whatever color they were painting the cars that day.\
 \
 (paragraph 4) The fishing industry collapsed. The few fish that survived were too poisonous to eat. Smog from the factory smoke and dust from the cement plants blanketed the valley. And it was all legal.\
 \
 (paragraph 5) Most people don’t start out with dreams of polluting a river. But it was often the result of people chasing their dreams of wealth with little care of how they reached it. The Hudson Valley had always drawn them.\
 \
 (paragraph 6) But now there were other dreamers in the valley, with their own dreams of wealth. They dreamed of the wealth of wildlife in a healthy forest, the abundance of fish in oxygen-rich water, and the great fortune of living in a beautiful river valley.\
 \
 (paragraph 7) So perhaps it was a matter of time before the two types of dreamers would meet each other—in court.\
 \
 (paragraph 8) In 1963, Con Edison, New York City’s power company, proposed a plan for constructing the largest hydroelectric pumping station ever built. The plan called for carving out a gigantic hole in the side of majestic Storm King Mountain on the Hudson River.\
 \
 (paragraph 9) But then they met Franny Reese. Franny was a longtime valley resident with a simple point to make: the mountain could not speak for itself. If she didn’t speak for it, who would?\
 \
 (paragraph 10) Franny and a group of like-minded people founded Scenic Hudson and took on the power company in a landmark court case. Con Ed challenged the right of private citizens to participate, but the court sided with the citizens, in the ruling now known as the Scenic Hudson Decision.\
 \
 (paragraph 11) After dragging out the case for seventeen years, Con Ed finally gave up and Storm King survived unblemished. It was the beginning of the environmental movement in this country, and once again, the Hudson Valley was the birthplace.\
 \
 (paragraph 12) More and more people joined the movement as they realized how much difference each of us can make.\
 \
 (paragraph 13) The love of their land was still alive in the hearts of Americans, and now that it was aroused again, things began to change.\
 \
 (paragraph 14) Many new laws and new citizens’ groups have been inspired by those early heroes of the environment, and their work has begun to bring the Hudson back to life.\
 \
 (paragraph 15) The Mahicans called it “The River That Flows Both Ways.” Slowly we are learning that taking care of the river is the only way that the river can take care of us.\
 \
 (paragraph 16) Fifty years have passed since I dreamed of going to New York to see the river that shares my name, and thirty-five years since that dream came true. I live in the Hudson Valley now, grateful to all those who came before me, following their dreams to this river, building this nation, sharing its beauty, securing its future.\
 \
 (paragraph 17) It’s now my turn to help in keeping the river of dreams flowing, for all those dreamers yet to come.\
Which sentence is most important to include in a summary of the article?\
(A) One company colored the river red and yellow with excess car paint.\
 (B) The Hudson River became polluted in the effort to gain wealth.\
 (C) The Mahicans have a saying about taking care of the river.\
 (D) The author has dreamed of returning to the Hudson River for fifty years.\

Reading Comprehension Passage A\
 \
 Screeno\
 In the following passage, Cornelius Schmidt seeks refuge from a gloomy, rainy night by going to a movie. \
 \
 …At the door [of the theater] the uniformed ticket taker gave him a card on which was \
 printed a kind of checkerboard, having in each box a number. It was obviously the old game \
 of Lotto, the object being to get five numbers which were successive either horizontally or\
 vertically or in a diagonal. In the center, amid numbered boxes, was a box entitled\
 (line 5) GRATIS; (GRATIS - free, a space that could count as any number called) the management gave this box to the audience. …\
    The theatre fell into a semi-darkness, not the movie darkness, but one in which discreet\
 lights shone on both sides of the theatre and both sides of the stage. A white and pink\
 clockface flashed on the screen. It was, in fact, like a roulette wheel, and had numbers\
 running from 1 to 100. In the center was a pointer, which suddenly began to whirl furiously \
 (line 10) about the clockface, and then slowed down, and then stopped.\
    \"Ninety-nine!\" said the businesslike yet airy young man in an authoritative voice.\
 An usher wrote down the number upon a blackboard to the right of the screen. The pointer \
 spun again, at a tremendous pace, so that it was almost a moving blur for a moment, and\
 then clarified into its arrow-like straightness. The actual wheel was, of course, in the\
 (line 15) projection room.\
    \"Fifty-four!\" said the young master of ceremonies, simulating a dramatic tone.\
    \"SCREENO!\" cried a voice from the balcony in a mocking voice, while everyone\
 laughed, for obviously no one could have SCREENO as yet.\
    \"I am sorry, ladies and gentlemen,\" said the young man in an affable (affable - friendly) voice,\" but we will \
 (line 20) have to ask you not to be humorous about this. After all, money is involved, and there has\
 been much confusion in the past because various people insisted upon trying to be\
 funny.\"…\
    The pointer was revolving again. \"Thirty-nine!\" announced the young man. The\
 audience was not yet warmed up, because too few numbers had been called for anyone to \
 (line 25) be on the verge of winning. Cornelius, however, also had this third number and was pleased \
 no little by the course of events.\
    \"Forty-nine!\" announced the young man. …\
    \"Fourteen!\" cried the young man into the microphone which made his voice even more\
 official than otherwise. Cornelius did not have the number. He assured himself that the\
 (line 30) game was a fraud, that the management was obviously not going to permit anyone to win so \
 much money and that the whole business would obviously be controlled in the projection \
 room or by arranging the numbers on the cards. There was only one more chance, a drop\
 in the ocean. He slouched back in his seat, chiding himself for his great excitement. …\
    \"Twenty-five!\" the master of ceremonies called out.\
 (line 35)    \"Twenty-five! Twenty-five!\" said Cornelius to himself, and then, finding the number on\
 his card as the fifth consecutive horizontal number, he rose in his seat and shouted:\
    \"SCREENO!\" in a too loud voice which broke, and began to issue (to issue - to exit) from his aisle,\
 tripping over the feet of the people seated near him, some of whom were solicitous (solicitous - helpful) of his\
 walk, and eager to provide good advice as he passed. The attractiveness of the winner shone\
 (line 40) in him. …\
    An usher took his card, and checked it with the numbers on the blackboard. The young\
 man came over to oversee the usher. It seemed as if something was wrong, someone\
 had miscalculated, to look at the young man. The checking was done several times.\
 Very bureaucratic, said Cornelius to himself. Recovering, as the checkup proved that\
 (line 45) Cornelius had indeed won, he shook Cornelius’s hand and the whole theatre lighted up.\
    \"Lucky fellow,\" cried the balcony voice, amusing the audience again, by the envious\
 tone in his voice. …\
    The usher arrived with the money just as the persistent balcony voice called out,\
 \"Let’s go on with the show,\" and the audience began to clap again, wishing to have its\
 (line 50) chance at the other prizes.\
    But then, as the money was delivered to the young assistant manager, and he began\
 officiously to count it out, shuffle it, and arrange it, before paying Cornelius, a hoarse and \
 disused voice cried from the balcony:\
    \"SCREENO! SCREENO!\" …\
 (line 55)   \"SCREENO!\" came the voice again, this time nearer, as the new winner approached\
 the stairs from the balcony to the orchestra. The young assistant manager and the ushers \
 looked at each other in dismay. Something had obviously gone wrong, for usually no one\
 won the jackpot; two winners was inconceivable and would lead to bankruptcy. Someone\
 was going to lose his job because of this. …\
 (line 60)   \"My name is Casper Weingarten,\" said the old man, unasked, intruding himself upon\
 the huddle of the assistant manager and the ushers. He was very nervous, very excited.\
 \"I am a musician,\" he said, but no one paid any attention to him, except Cornelius.\
    And then the young assistant manager came over to the old man and, holding the card\
 up, showed him that he had not won, that he had mistaken a 7 for a 1 because the print had\
 (line 65) been on the left-hand side. \"Perhaps you’ll win one of the other prizes,\" he said,\
 courteously, \"since you already have four numbers in a row.\" …\
    Cornelius came over to look into the matter for himself. He took the card in his hand\
 and looked at the number in question. The old man looked at him, and then turned to the\
 assistant manager, saying:\
 (line 70)   \"Give me my money! I have won!\" …\
    \"Look here,\" said Cornelius tactfully to the assistant manager, \"it seems to me that you\
 can only assume that this is a 1. The blur is too faint to make it a seven.\"\
    \"I know it is a 7,\" said the assistant manager angrily, and when he said that, Cornelius\
 recognized immediately that he was so sure because the cards had been prepared in\
 (line 75) advance to obviate the possibility of two winners of the jackpot, or even one. Seeing this,\
 Cornelius began to feel sick and angry, as he always did when confronted with fraud or\
 cheating.\
    \"All my life I’ve been cheated,\" said the old man, wringing his hands. \"Give me my\
 money.\" An usher took his arm, as if to lead him from the stage, but the assistant manager\
 (line 80) deterred him, unwilling as yet to resort to force. …\
    \"My good man,\" said the assistant manager, \"Your hard luck is not my fault, nor this\
 theatre’s responsibility. Please do not cause a disturbance. Now if both of you will leave the\
 stage, we can go on with the other prizes and with the show.\"\
    In answer, the old man sat down upon the stage, looking grotesque there, with his head\
 (line 85) turned up. \"I will sit here until I am paid,\" he said tearfully. …\
    But the audience was won over, for no one wished to lose his chance at the remaining\
 $50. There was a murmuring of voices and someone cried out:\
    \"Go home and give us a chance.\" …\
    \"Call a cop,\" said another. …\
 (line 90)   Cornelius meditated with himself for a moment and then said: \"Listen, I will give you\
 half of the jackpot. Come on before you’re arrested.\" …\
    \"No,\" said Weingarten, \"I don’t want your money. I want mine. Give me my money,\"\
 he said towards the assistant manager.\
    Cornelius considered matters with himself again and came to a decision. Easy come,\
 (line 95) easy go, he said to himself, and then he told the old musician that he could have the whole\
 jackpot. The manager protested immediately, but Cornelius took the bills from his pocket\
 and began to count them out and give them to the musician, who accepted them with\
 a guilty look and trembling hands.\
    The audience saw what was happening and applauded vigorously, not because it was\
 (line 100) genuinely moved, but because it felt that it ought to applaud. Such applause is heard at\
 public gatherings when an abstraction too vacuous (vacuous - insincere) is mentioned or tribute is paid to a man\
 long dead. The assistant manager, trying to move in on Cornelius’s credit, came over to\
 shake hands with Cornelius. Cornelius, tempted to reject the proffered hand, accepted it\
 because he wished to cause no further disturbance.\
 (line 105)   The old man had risen and come over to Cornelius.\
    \"Thank you very much for your kindness,\" he said in the estranged voice of those who\
 have been weeping or overexcited.\
    \"Not at all,\" said Cornelius formally. Both descended from the stage together. …\

What Do Flies Think About?\
 From Ideas & Discoveries Magazine\
 \
 It seems unbelievable, but an insect’s brain is more brilliant than any supercomputer.\
 That’s why researchers are studying flies and bees to understand their cognition. Food for\
 thought . . .\
 Though it may seem like a mundane question, there is serious science behind it: Why\
 (line 5) is a common housefly able to land on a ceiling? After all, the insect flies with its feet down\
 when it’s below the ceiling, yet, in the blink of an eye, the fly is suddenly perched with feet\
 upward. The explanation for the fly’s aerial feat is important because it can reveal a lot\
 about what the insect’s brain is capable of: Regardless of how the fly manages the landing,\
 its tiny brain (which consists of only 100,000 nerve cells) has to go into high gear to carry\
 (line 10) it out. For a long time, scientists believed the flies turn around in flight much like a fighter\
 pilot performs loops. This would require them to first “visualize” a mental rotation—in\
 other words, to plan the loop beforehand.\
 It was only recently that researchers discovered how a fly actually lands on a ceiling.\
 Using a high-speed camera, they discovered that flies don’t perform a loop after all.\
 (line 15) Instead, they stretch out their front legs over their head and toward the ceiling. As soon as\
 the legs make contact with the ceiling, the fly swings its body around 180 degrees like a\
 gymnast on a horizontal bar. Then it simply attaches itself to the ceiling with all its legs.\
 This precision landing requires perfect coordination of all its muscles. The fly’s swinging\
 motion also needs to be calculated, which means information shoots through its body in\
 (line 20) the space of milliseconds. Not even an autopilot system controlled by a high-tech\
 computer could carry out such a maneuver.\
 Bees are a favorite experimental creature for researchers because they are easy to breed\
 and are considered the “Einsteins” of the insect world. These striped geniuses perform\
 intellectual feats that cannot be taken for granted, even among mammals. Bees can count,\
 (line 25) distinguish between objects like humans and dogs, recognize complex shapes, learn things,\
 navigate across great distances and remember their routes, and return to their hives and\
 tell other bees exactly where the tastiest flowers are. Compare that with the difficulties\
 humans can have when finding their way around an unfamiliar city without a map—not\
 to mention having to describe to friends the route they took. “Brain size is not necessarily\
 (line 30) an indicator of intelligence,” says bee researcher Lars Chittka at Queen Mary, University of\
 London. “Larger brains usually utilize the same circuits over and over again. This might\
 make for more detailed thinking or remembering, but it doesn’t guarantee the thoughts or\
 memories will be better.”\
 Bees are also social insects that create complex colony systems and display a high\
 (line 35) degree of social behavior. The idea of life in a group is firmly rooted in their brains—\
 which is what makes bees so interesting to brain researchers. We, too, are social creatures,\
 after all, and scientists suspect that certain neuronal circuits have changed very little over\
 the course of evolution. In other words, bee brains could provide us with information on\
 nerve connections that will help us better understand our own human nature and how we\
 (line 40) think.\
 Researchers already know that insects living in groups need to have more computing\
 power in their head. This is illustrated by the fact that all social insects have a larger brain\
 than their loner counterparts. A key factor in this discovery was a study conducted by\
 biologists at a Smithsonian lab in Panama. The country is home to a bee species that\
 (line 45) contains some members that live alone and others that form groups. The biologists\
 discovered that the loner bees also had a smaller brain. So it appears that a larger brain is\
 a consequence of group living. The same phenomenon is even more pronounced among\
 several species of locusts that begin life alone and later join up to form giant swarms: As\
 soon as they get together, their brains begin to grow by one-third. It’s likely they need to\
 (line 50) possess greater thinking capacity in order to compete with rivals in the swarm. It’s also\
 likely that flying and communicating in a swarm is more difficult than doing those things\
 alone. The biologists still don’t know how locusts get their brains to grow. The\
 explanation, should it be found, might be of interest to medical researchers looking into\
 treatments for paralysis or strokes. In any case, the researchers have found substances in\
 (line 55) the locusts’ brain that are extremely effective at killing bacteria. These substances are not\
 related to any known antibiotics, so they could possibly pave the way for new medications\
 in the future.\
 Such discoveries are definitely pointing scientists in a new direction. However,\
 practically no insect brain researcher has gone as far as Atsushi Takashima at the Tokyo\
 (line 60) Institute of Technology in Japan. Takashima has inserted electrodes into the brains of male\
 moths that he then uses as control units for a robot. Whenever the moth-machine hybrid\
 catches the scent of a female moth, it begins to search for the source. “Chemical\
 substances do not spread out uniformly in air,” Takashima explains. “So even though their\
 concentrations increase as you get closer to their source, the effects of wind and air\
 (line 65) currents make an analysis extremely difficult. But thanks to evolution, insect brains have\
 developed techniques to get around this problem.” Takashima’s research has significant\
 applications: His goal is to create robots that can sniff out explosives or dangerous\
 chemicals in the air and locate their source. One day a processor will control such robots,\
 but for now, a moth’s brain is far superior to any supercomputer on the market.\

Excerpt from Humans With Amazing Senses\
 \
 When bats go out to hunt, they send out sonar signals at such high frequencies and in\
 such rapid bursts that they can hear the signals bounce off mosquitoes in midair. They\
 then zero in on the insects like laser-guided missiles. Dolphins use the same technique to\
 find their dinners. It’s called echolocation, a technique that uses sound to identify objects\
 (line 5) by the echoes they produce.\
 Fourteen-year-old Ben Underwood of Sacramento, Calif., is one of the few people\
 known to use echolocation as a primary means of navigating the world on land. There’s\
 not even a hint of light reaching his brain. His eyes are artificial, but his brain has adapted\
 to allow him to appraise his environment. He makes a “clicking” sound to communicate\
 (line 10) with objects and people around him.\
 Scientists have discovered that in the brains of the blind, the visual cortex has not\
 become useless, as they once believed. When blind people use another sense—touch or\
 hearing, for example—to substitute for sight, the brain’s visual cortex becomes active, even\
 though no images reach it from the optic nerve. Echolocation creates its own images.\
 (line 15) “I can hear that wall behind you over there. I can hear right there—the radio, and the\
 fan,” Ben says.\
 Ben says every object in his life talks to him in ways that no one else can hear\
 or understand.\
 Forty-year-old Daniel Kish of Long Beach, Calif., also uses echolocation, and has\
 (line 20) become an expert on it, founding the World Access for the Blind, an organization that\
 teaches others how to echolocate. Kish leads other blind people on mountain biking tours\
 and hikes in the wilderness, visualizing and describing the picturesque sights around him\
 through echolocating.\
 Clicking to Do Anything\
 If you listen closely to Ben or Kish, you can hear how they find their way. Ben says he\
 (line 25) can distinguish where the curbs are as he cruises his neighborhood streets.\
 He can find the pole and the backboard on a basketball goal, and tell which is which\
 by the distinctive echo each makes. Even though he can’t see the goal he’s aiming for, he\
 can sink a basket. Ben doesn’t remember how or when he began clicking, but he’s\
 developed his abilities to such an extent that aside from echolocation, he can rapidly\
 (line 30) discriminate the sounds in video games.\
 Ben lost his sight when he was 2. He was diagnosed with cancer in both eyes, and\
 when chemotherapy failed, his mother, Aquanetta Gordon, was left with one option: For\
 her son to live, both his eyes had to be surgically removed.\
 Gordon remembers her son after the operation.\
 (line 35) “He woke up and he said, ‘Mom, I can’t see anymore, I can’t see anymore.’ And I took\
 his hands and I put them on my face and I said, ‘Baby, yes, you can see.’ I said, ‘You can\
 see with your hands.’ And then I put my hand on his nose and I said, ‘You smell me? You\
 can see with your nose and your ears. . . . You can’t use your eyes anymore, but you have\
 your hands and your nose and your ears.’ ”\
 (line 40) In a house already filled with three other children, Ben’s mother decided not to treat\
 his blindness as a handicap. In school, Ben recognizes his classmates by their voices. With\
 the help of Braille books and a talking laptop computer, Ben attends the same classes as\
 sighted students.\
 Rich Mental Images, Without Visual Elements\
 Like Ben, Kish also lost his eyesight to cancer at age 1. He was raised to believe he\
 (line 45) could do pretty much anything, and he discovered clicking by accident as a child.\
 “I have mental images that are very rich, very complex. They simply do not possess\
 the visual element,” Kish says.\
 In retrieving those pictures, Kish varies the pace and volume of his clicks as he\
 walks along; and what he can tell you about an object’s qualities is sometimes\
 (line 50) astonishingly thorough.\
 If bats can distinguish prey as small as mosquitoes with echolocation, and some\
 dolphins can detect small targets a hundred yards away, what are the ultimate capabilities\
 of human beings like Ben and Kish?\
 Peter Scheifele, who studies hearing and sound production in animals and people at\
 (line 55) the University of Connecticut, analyzed samples of the clicks that Ben and Kish make.\
 “Ben clicks, looks to me like once every half second, whereas a dolphin is actually\
 making 900 clicks per second. And the bat is even faster than that,” Scheifele says.\
 The bottom line: Human beings send out sounds at much slower rates and lower\
 frequencies, so the objects people can picture with echolocation must be much larger than\
 (line 60) the ones bats and dolphins can find.\
Read this sentence from lines 17 and 18.\
 Ben says every object in his life talks to him in ways that no one else can hear or understand.\
 Which quotation best supports this claim?\
(A) “He can find the pole and the backboard on a basketball goal, and tell which is which by the distinctive echo each makes.” (lines 26 and 27)\
 (B) “Even though he can’t see the goal he’s aiming for, he can sink a basket.” (lines 27 and 28)\
 (C) “In school, Ben recognizes his classmates by their voices.” (line 41)\
 (D) “With the help of Braille books and a talking laptop computer, Ben attends the same classes as sighted students.” (lines 41 through 43)\

. . . Yet in recent months something has changed. Kim Jong Il, whose regime was responsible for the first test and who died in 2011, had only a rudimentary [basic] nuclear device, useful mainly for blackmail. Under his son, Kim Jong Un, the programme has rapidly gathered pace, with two nuclear tests this year alone. The North has also conducted 21 missile tests this year, including one from a submarine—a first. The ability to miniaturise a tactical nuclear weapon on a working missile could be just two or three years away, with an intercontinental ballistic missile capable of hitting California possible in five years’ time. Chun Yung-woo, a South Korean former national security adviser, talks of “growing outrage. . .after five tests, a change of mood, a sense of urgency.”\
 \
 Once, it was possible to hope that the North’s isolated regime would implode [fail] under its own contradictions before it gained a proper nuclear capability. But the spread of informal markets and, for some North Koreans, a measure of prosperity may have strengthened the regime’s chances of survival. A consensus in Seoul is forming that Mr Kim now aims to dictate events on the peninsula—including the ability to demand that the Americans leave. One senior foreign diplomat in Seoul says that for the first time he hears people wondering openly whether there will be a major conflict on the peninsula in their lifetime. . . .\

 Anabolic Steroids\
    Anabolic steroids are hormones that affect muscle growth. Many athletes take synthetic anabolic steroids, in hopes of developing larger muscles so they can perform better at their sport. These hormones can act like the hormone testosterone. When men take an excess of anabolic steroids, they can have an increase in feminine features. This is due to the fact that the excess of these chemicals signals the male body to stop producing testosterone.\
This signal in the male body to stop producing testosterone is an example of\
(1) an underproduction of estrogen\
 (2) a feedback mechanism\
 (3) an overproduction of testosterone\
 (4) a decrease in anabolic steroid use\

Base your answers to questions 36 through 38 on the passage and mineral table below and on your knowledge of Earth science. The table shows some properties of four minerals that display fluorescence.\
 \
 Fluorescent Minerals\
 All minerals have the ability to reflect visible light. Only about 15% of minerals have an interesting physical property known as fluorescence. These minerals have the ability to temporarily absorb a small amount of electromagnetic energy and, an instant later, release a small amount of energy of a different wavelength. This change in wavelength causes a temporary color change of the mineral in the eye of an observer. The color change of fluorescent minerals is most spectacular when the minerals are placed in darkness and exposed to electromagnetic energy shorter than visible light.\
 \
 A former zinc mine in New Jersey is one of the most famous sources of fluorescent minerals in the entire world. Zincite and willemite were two of the zinc ores mined there. It was later discovered that more than 91 minerals in this region displayed fluorescence under shortwave electromagnetic energy.\
 \
 Mineral | Hardness | Color Under Visible Light | “Fluorescent” Color | Composition\
 Calcite | 3 | clear-white-variable | bright orange | CaCO3\
 Celestine | 3 to 3.5 | colorless-variable | yellow and/or white/blue | SrSO4\
 Willemite | 5.5 | pink-tan | bright green | Zn2SiO4\
 Zincite | 4 | yellow-orange | yellow | ZnO\
Which two minerals can have the same fluorescent color?\
(1) calcite and celestine\
 (2) calcite and zincite\
 (3) celestine and willemite\
 (4) celestine and zincite\

What Do Flies Think About?\
 From Ideas & Discoveries Magazine\
 \
 It seems unbelievable, but an insect’s brain is more brilliant than any supercomputer.\
 That’s why researchers are studying flies and bees to understand their cognition. Food for\
 thought . . .\
 Though it may seem like a mundane question, there is serious science behind it: Why\
 (line 5) is a common housefly able to land on a ceiling? After all, the insect flies with its feet down\
 when it’s below the ceiling, yet, in the blink of an eye, the fly is suddenly perched with feet\
 upward. The explanation for the fly’s aerial feat is important because it can reveal a lot\
 about what the insect’s brain is capable of: Regardless of how the fly manages the landing,\
 its tiny brain (which consists of only 100,000 nerve cells) has to go into high gear to carry\
 (line 10) it out. For a long time, scientists believed the flies turn around in flight much like a fighter\
 pilot performs loops. This would require them to first “visualize” a mental rotation—in\
 other words, to plan the loop beforehand.\
 It was only recently that researchers discovered how a fly actually lands on a ceiling.\
 Using a high-speed camera, they discovered that flies don’t perform a loop after all.\
 (line 15) Instead, they stretch out their front legs over their head and toward the ceiling. As soon as\
 the legs make contact with the ceiling, the fly swings its body around 180 degrees like a\
 gymnast on a horizontal bar. Then it simply attaches itself to the ceiling with all its legs.\
 This precision landing requires perfect coordination of all its muscles. The fly’s swinging\
 motion also needs to be calculated, which means information shoots through its body in\
 (line 20) the space of milliseconds. Not even an autopilot system controlled by a high-tech\
 computer could carry out such a maneuver.\
 Bees are a favorite experimental creature for researchers because they are easy to breed\
 and are considered the “Einsteins” of the insect world. These striped geniuses perform\
 intellectual feats that cannot be taken for granted, even among mammals. Bees can count,\
 (line 25) distinguish between objects like humans and dogs, recognize complex shapes, learn things,\
 navigate across great distances and remember their routes, and return to their hives and\
 tell other bees exactly where the tastiest flowers are. Compare that with the difficulties\
 humans can have when finding their way around an unfamiliar city without a map—not\
 to mention having to describe to friends the route they took. “Brain size is not necessarily\
 (line 30) an indicator of intelligence,” says bee researcher Lars Chittka at Queen Mary, University of\
 London. “Larger brains usually utilize the same circuits over and over again. This might\
 make for more detailed thinking or remembering, but it doesn’t guarantee the thoughts or\
 memories will be better.”\
 Bees are also social insects that create complex colony systems and display a high\
 (line 35) degree of social behavior. The idea of life in a group is firmly rooted in their brains—\
 which is what makes bees so interesting to brain researchers. We, too, are social creatures,\
 after all, and scientists suspect that certain neuronal circuits have changed very little over\
 the course of evolution. In other words, bee brains could provide us with information on\
 nerve connections that will help us better understand our own human nature and how we\
 (line 40) think.\
 Researchers already know that insects living in groups need to have more computing\
 power in their head. This is illustrated by the fact that all social insects have a larger brain\
 than their loner counterparts. A key factor in this discovery was a study conducted by\
 biologists at a Smithsonian lab in Panama. The country is home to a bee species that\
 (line 45) contains some members that live alone and others that form groups. The biologists\
 discovered that the loner bees also had a smaller brain. So it appears that a larger brain is\
 a consequence of group living. The same phenomenon is even more pronounced among\
 several species of locusts that begin life alone and later join up to form giant swarms: As\
 soon as they get together, their brains begin to grow by one-third. It’s likely they need to\
 (line 50) possess greater thinking capacity in order to compete with rivals in the swarm. It’s also\
 likely that flying and communicating in a swarm is more difficult than doing those things\
 alone. The biologists still don’t know how locusts get their brains to grow. The\
 explanation, should it be found, might be of interest to medical researchers looking into\
 treatments for paralysis or strokes. In any case, the researchers have found substances in\
 (line 55) the locusts’ brain that are extremely effective at killing bacteria. These substances are not\
 related to any known antibiotics, so they could possibly pave the way for new medications\
 in the future.\
 Such discoveries are definitely pointing scientists in a new direction. However,\
 practically no insect brain researcher has gone as far as Atsushi Takashima at the Tokyo\
 (line 60) Institute of Technology in Japan. Takashima has inserted electrodes into the brains of male\
 moths that he then uses as control units for a robot. Whenever the moth-machine hybrid\
 catches the scent of a female moth, it begins to search for the source. “Chemical\
 substances do not spread out uniformly in air,” Takashima explains. “So even though their\
 concentrations increase as you get closer to their source, the effects of wind and air\
 (line 65) currents make an analysis extremely difficult. But thanks to evolution, insect brains have\
 developed techniques to get around this problem.” Takashima’s research has significant\
 applications: His goal is to create robots that can sniff out explosives or dangerous\
 chemicals in the air and locate their source. One day a processor will control such robots,\
 but for now, a moth’s brain is far superior to any supercomputer on the market.\
Which central idea of the article is most supported by lines 34 through 40?\
(A) Social insects develop larger brains.\
 (B) Brain structures have changed little over time.\
 (C) Bee colonies can help us understand social systems.\
 (D) Insect brains can help us understand the human brain.\

In West Africa, the Harmattan is a dry, dust-filled wind.\
 Excerpt from A Scrap and a Robe\
 by Myrina D. McCullough\
 \
 (paragraph 1) The West African Harmattan whipped up a billow of dust. Suddenly Sali spied a scrap of glorious orange damask cloth turning in the hot wind like a flame. She followed as it danced down a street she didn’t know very well. She skipped over holes and skirted people on chairs.\
 damask = woven cloth\
 skirted = went around\
 (paragraph 2) All at once the wind died down, and the scrap settled gently on the scratchy, sandy road.\
 (paragraph 3) Sali picked up the cloth and gazed at it with admiring eyes. She turned it this way and that in the sun and imagined herself in a flowing dlokibani made of such cloth. This was a treasure, and she would take it home for her little wooden doll. It would surely make a lovely headpiece for that lucky one.\
 dlokibani or dloki = a long dress\
 (paragraph 4) Sali wandered back the way she had come, slowly now. At the corner of the street, she passed the table vendor, who was selling his dusty packets of tea and two-pill packs of aspirin. She passed Ami’s mother, roasting peanuts and selling them by the handful. She turned onto the larger street and passed a plastic-goods store that displayed rows and rows of brightly colored plastic plates, bowls, and teapots. She glanced into the next shop and then stopped short. It was a fabric shop! There on the high counter was an entire bolt of the same wondrous cloth she held in her hand!\
 (paragraph 5) The next day Sali went back to the cloth shop. She stood near the door and watched the storekeeper. He measured and cut, as one person after another bought pieces of cloth. Her prized orange damask was back on a high shelf to the rear of the store.\
 (paragraph 6) After a while the shopkeeper looked at Sali. “Why do you stand so long at the door?” he asked.\
 (paragraph 7) Sali took a deep breath and said, “I would like to help you in the store till I could earn enough of that orange cloth to make a dlokibani for myself.”\
 (paragraph 8) The orange fabric glowed in a shaft of light from the uncovered bulb at the back of the store.\
 (paragraph 9) “That is very special and expensive cloth, little one,” the shopkeeper told her.\
 (paragraph 10) So she swept the courtyard and threw away scraps. She pushed big rolls of cloth back and forth. She ran to buy cough drops and peanuts and kola nuts for the shopkeeper. For days and days she worked.\
 (paragraph 11) Finally, one day the store owner lifted down the lustrous roll of orange damask and measured out several yards. “You’ve worked well for this cloth, Sali,” he said. “I thank you.”\
 (paragraph 12) Sali rushed straight home with her treasure. Carefully she placed the cloth in her trunk.\
 (paragraph 13) But how was she to get the dloki made? Sali did not know how to sew. Her mother always had their clothes made by a tailor who sat in a tiny shop several blocks from their house.\
 (paragraph 14) Sali went and stood under a tree near the tailor’s shop. She watched the people come and go. The tailor would whip out his measuring tape and see how tall the people were, how fat they were, how long their arms, how short their necks. He measured every part of them.\
 (paragraph 15) After almost a whole day the tailor noticed Sali.\
 (paragraph 16) “What are you doing there, little girl?” he asked.\
 (paragraph 17) “I have some beautiful cloth,” she said, “and I want it sewn into a dlokibani. Could I work for you to pay for sewing it into a robe for me?”\
 (paragraph 18) The tailor agreed. Once again Sali worked for days and days. She swept and fanned the tea coals and held scissors and brought thread. At last, the tailor said, “Bring me the cloth, Sali.”\
 (paragraph 19) Sali rushed home and brought back the satiny, shining cloth. She also brought her doll, its small head still neatly wrapped in the swatch of orange. The tailor took his tape and measured Sali, shoulder to ankle, shoulder to elbow, left shoulder to right shoulder. Then he started cutting the billows of orange fabric.\
 (paragraph 20) The next day was an important holiday called Tabaski. Drums were beating in many neighborhoods. Relatives and friends came to visit Sali’s family. Sali slipped quietly away. Soon her mother missed her. “Now where has Sali gone?” she exclaimed.\
 (paragraph 21) Just then, Sali walked in, proudly wearing a beautiful orange dloki with a matching headdress. In her arms she carried her doll, dressed exactly as she was!\
What do the details in paragraph 3 show about Sali?\
(A) She is thoughtful and creative.\
 (B) She is greedy and demanding.\
 (C) She is careful and ambitious.\
 (D) She is strange and secretive.\

Excerpt from One-Eyed Cat\
 by Paula Fox\
 \
 Ned loved snow, the whisper when he walked through it, a sound like candles being\
 blown out, the coming indoors out of it into the warmth, and standing on the register in\
 the big hall through which the dusty, metal-smelling heat blew up, and the going back out\
 again, shivering, cold, stooping and scooping up a handful to make a snowball, packing it\
 (line 5) hard with wet mittens, hefting it, tossing it as far as he could, and the runners of his sled\
 whispering across it as he sleighed down the slopes which were smooth and glittering and\
 hard, like great jewels.\
 On the first of December, there was a heavy snowfall. When Ned looked out of his\
 window the next morning, the river glowed like a snake made out of light as it wound\
 (line 10) among the snow-covered mountains.\
 He ate breakfast hastily, too preoccupied to read the story on the cereal box.\
 Mrs. Scallop (Mrs. Scallop: Ned’s family’s housekeeper) was broody this morning and left him a lone, her glance passing over him as\
 it passed over the kitchen chairs.\
 On the porch, he paused to take deep breaths of air which tasted, he imagined, like\
 (line 15) water from the center of the ocean, then he waded into the snow, passing the Packard (Packard: a brand of car that is no longer manufactured), its\
 windows white and hidden, the crabapple tree with its weighted branches, down the long\
 hill trying to guess if he was anywhere near the buried driveway. By the time he reached\
 Mr. Scully’s house, his galoshes were topped with snow and his feet were wet. Mr. Scully’s\
 shades were drawn; the house had a pinched look as though it felt the cold.\
 (line 20) Ned went around to the back until he could see the shed. There were boot tracks in\
 the snow leading to it and returning to the back door. He guessed the old man had taken\
 in the cat’s bowl; it was nowhere to be seen. You couldn’t leave anything out in this\
 weather, it would freeze. Mr. Scully had told him that finding water in the winter was a\
 big problem for animals. Licking the snow or ice could make them sick.\
 (line 25) Ned stared hard at the shed. Perhaps the cat was inside, squeezed in behind logs in a\
 tight space where its own breath would keep it warm. He was going to be late to school if\
 he didn’t get a move on, but he kept looking hard all over the yard as though he could\
 make the cat appear out of snow and gray sky. Twice, his glance passed over the icebox.\
 The third time, he saw that the motionless mound on top of it was not only the quilt but\
 (line 30) the cat, joined into one shape by a dusting of snow.\
 Ned held his breath for a moment, then put his own feet in Mr. Scully’s tracks and\
 went toward the shed. The tracks had frozen and they crunched under Ned’s weight, but\
 the cat didn’t raise its head. Ned halted a few feet away from it—but of course, he realized,\
 it wouldn’t hear him because of its deaf ear. He could have gone closer to it than he’d ever\
 (line 35) been but he had a sudden vision of the cat exploding into fear when it finally did\
 hear him.\
 When he got back to the front of the house, he saw fresh footsteps on the road. He\
 could tell it was the road because of the deep ditches which fell away to either side. He\
 guessed they were Billy’s tracks. It was odd to think that Billy, huffing and puffing, had\
 (line 40) gone past Mr. Scully’s place, thinking his own thoughts, while he, Ned, only a few yards\
 away, had been searching for the cat. He found Evelyn’s tracks, too, and later on, Janet’s,\
 the smallest of all. He felt ghostly as if he’d been left alone on a white, silent globe.\
 Somewhere in the evergreen woods, snow must have slid off a bough, for he heard the\
 loud plop, then the fainter sound of the bough springing up, relieved of the weight. He\
 (line 45) thought about the cat, visualizing how it had looked on the quilt. How still it had been!\
 Why hadn’t he gone right up to it, looked at it close, touched its fur? Why had it been so\
 motionless—still as death, still as a dead vole he’d seen last summer in the grass near the\
 well? He came to the snow-covered blacktop road upon which a few cars had left their\
 ridged tire tracks. He had a strong impulse to turn back, to play hooky for the first time in\
 (line 50) his life. Mr. Scully, with his poor eyesight, might not spot the cat on top of the icebox,\
 might not, then, set food out for it. Fretting and shivering, his feet numb, Ned went on\
 to school.\
 He tried very hard to concentrate on his lessons, to watch Miss Jefferson’s plump, even\
 handwriting on the blackboard as she wrote out the lines from a poem by Thomas Gray\
 (line 55) that the class was to memorize that week, but try as he might, the image of the unmoving\
 animal on the ragged old quilt persisted. Last week, on a rainy afternoon, the cat had\
 looked at Ned, had cocked its head as though to see him better. Its one eye, narrowed, had\
 reminded him of a grain of wheat.\
 “The curfew tolls the knell of parting day,\
 (line 60) The lowing herd wind slowly o’er the lea . . .”\
 Ned read the lines several times before copying them down in his copybook. The\
 words made no sense to him. It was this that had made his hours in school so hard ever\
 since he and Mr. Scully had seen the cat last autumn, this drawing away of his attention\
 from everything that was going on around him. He was either relieved because the cat was\
 (line 65) where he could see it or fearful because he didn’t know where it was.\
Lines 37 through 42 in the story reveal that Ned feels\
(A) isolated\
 (B) confused\
 (C) relieved\
 (D) confident\

Excerpt from A la Carte\
 \
 by Tanita S. Davis\
 \
 (paragraph 1) “Homework?” My mother mouths the word exaggeratedly, eyebrows raised, and I roll my eyes. Frowning, she points with her chin to the side door that leads to the stairs. I roll my eyes again, mouthing, Okay, okay, not needing her to pantomime further what she wants me to do. I hate the thought of leaving the clattering nerve center of the restaurant to wrestle with my trigonometry homework in my mother’s quiet office downstairs.\
 \
 (paragraph 2) “Order!”\
 \
 (paragraph 3) The bright lights and swirl of noise and motion are muffled as the kitchen door swings closed behind me.\
 \
 (paragraph 4) It’s hard to remember a time when the restaurant hasn’t been the center of our lives. Mom used to be a copy editor and wrote food features for our local paper, the Clarion, and she met Pia when she did a write-up on the culinary school Pia attended. Pia thinks it was fate that Mom wanted to invest in a restaurant at the same time Pia wanted to buy the old bank building.\
 \
 (paragraph 5) La Salle Rouge doesn’t serve much in the way of “kid” food, since the menu doesn’t cater to people my age on a cheap date, but I’ve loved everything about it from the first. I started experimenting with being a vegetarian when I turned fourteen, but Pia still found things to feed me and taught me to be creative with vegetables and tofu. I like to think I’m the best-fed vegetarian in the state of California.\
 \
 (paragraph 6) Pia’s been really good about teaching what she knows, and I decided early on that this is the work I want to do—get out of school and get into the kitchen for good. Mom and Pia have created a popular French-Asian-Californian fusion restaurant that has gotten great reviews from food critics. They took the best of each other’s tastes—Mom’s traditional Southern flavors and Pia’s French training combined with her vegetable- and spice-savvy Cambodian tastes—and pulled off what one food critic called “stylized food with unique flavor combinations in an intimate setting.”\
 \
 (paragraph 7) Whatever that means.\
 \
 (paragraph 8) Three years ago, when I started high school thirty pounds heavier than everyone in my class, Mom and I came up with a light menu for La Salle Rouge, and it’s been such a popular idea that Mom lets me come up with tasty, low-calorie desserts, which is one of my favorite things to do. It hardly seems fair that I have to walk away from all of that just to do trigonometry, but my mom says I have to finish school before I concentrate on cooking. She says it’s smarter to have a “backup plan,” and she’s made me apply to plenty of colleges and check out business majors just in case I ever want to do anything else with my life. I guess that makes sense if you’re anybody other than me. When I turn eighteen, I already know what I’m going to do.\
 \
 (paragraph 9) First, I’m going to buy a plane ticket to D.C. and go to Julia Child’s kitchen at the Smithsonian and leave roses. They don’t let you walk through it, but somewhere—I don’t know where—I’m going to leave a bouquet and a little note for her. Julia Child is my patron saint. (patron saint - an inspiring person admired for his or her work) She’s the queen of all reasons people can do anything they want in life. Saint Julia didn’t start cooking until she was practically forty, and she went on to do TV shows and make cookbooks and be this huge part of culinary history. She never got too fancy, she never freaked out, and she was never afraid to try new things. I want to be just like her—except maybe get famous faster.\
 \
 (paragraph 10) The second thing I’m going to do is buy myself a set of knives. Pia swears by this set of German steel knives she got when she graduated, but I’ve seen the TV chef Kylie Kwong use a phenomenal-looking ceramic knife on her show on the Discovery Channel. Either way, knives are what the best chefs have of their very own.\
 \
 (paragraph 11) The third thing I’m going to do, after I get back from Washington and get my knives, is . . . get discovered. Somehow. I know I’m going to have to pay my dues, but I’m so ready for my real life to start. It’s not something I admit to a lot, but my real dream is to be a celebrity chef. Do you know how many African American female chefs there aren’t? And how many vegetarian chefs have their own shows? The field is wide open for stardom. Every time I watch old episodes of Saint Julia, I imagine that I have my own cooking show. The way celebrity chefs do it now, I could also have a line of cooking gear, cookbooks, aprons, the works. People would know my name, ask for my autograph, and try my recipes. All I have to do is finish my trig homework and get back into the kitchen.\

In this excerpt, the author talks about introducing her chickens to her yard.\
 \
 Excerpt from Birdology\
 by Sy Montgomery\
 \
 At first I was afraid they’d run away or become lost. We had a cozy, secure home for\
 them prepared in the bottom storey of our barn, with wood shavings scattered over the\
 dirt floor, a dispenser for fresh water, a trough for chick feed, some low perches made\
 from dowels, and a hay-lined nest box made from an old rabbit hutch left over from one\
 (line 5) of the barn’s previous denizens, in which they could lay future eggs. Chickens need to be\
 closed in safe at night to protect them from predators, but by day we didn’t want to\
 confine them; we wanted to give them free run of the yard. But how could they possibly\
 understand that they lived here now? Once we let them out, would they even recognize\
 their space in the barn and go back in it? When I was in seventh grade, my family had\
 (line 10) moved, once again, to a new house; my first afternoon there I literally got lost in my own\
 backyard. Could these six-week-old chicks be expected to know better?\
 Gretchen assured me there would be no problem. “Leave them in the pen for\
 twenty-four hours,” she told me. “Then you can let them out and they’ll stick around.\
 They’ll go back in again when it starts to get dark.”\
 (line 15) “But how do they know?” I asked.\
 “They just do,” she said. “Chickens just know these things.”\
 When before dusk, I found them all perched calmly back in their coop, I saw that\
 Gretchen was right.\
 In fact, chickens know many things, some from the moment they are born. Like all\
 (line 20) members of the order in which they are classified, the Galliformes, or game birds,\
 just-hatched baby chickens are astonishingly mature and mobile, able to walk, peck, and\
 run only hours after leaving the egg.\
 This developmental strategy is called precocial. Like its opposite, the altricial strategy\
 (employed by creatures such as humans and songbirds, who are born naked and helpless),\
 (line 25) the precocial strategy was sculpted by eons of adaptation to food and predators. If your\
 nest is on the ground, as most game birds’ are, it’s a good idea to get your babies out of\
 there as quickly as possible before someone comes to eat them. So newborn game birds\
 hatch covered in down, eyes open, and leave the nest within twenty-four hours. (An\
 Australian game bird known as the malleefowl begins its life by digging its way out of\
 (line 30) its nest of decaying vegetation and walks off into the bush without ever even meeting\
 either parent.)\
 That chickens hatch from the egg knowing how to walk, run, peck, and scratch has an\
 odd consequence: many people take this as further evidence they are stupid. But instinct is\
 not stupidity. (After all, Einstein was born knowing how to suckle.) Nor does instinct\
 (line 35) preclude learning. Unlike my disoriented seventh-grade self (and I have not improved\
 much since), young chickens have a great capacity for spatial learning. In scientific\
 experiments, researchers have trained days-old chicks to find hidden food using both\
 distant and nearby landmarks as cues. Italian researchers demonstrated that at the tender\
 age of fifteen days, after just a week’s training to find hidden food in the middle of their\
 (line 40) cage, chicks can correctly calculate the center of a given environment—even in the\
 absence of distinctive landmarks. Even more astonishing, they can do it in spaces they\
 have never seen before, whether the area be circular, square, or triangular. How? The\
 chicks “probably relied on a visual estimate of these distances from their actual positions,”\
 wrote University of Padova researcher L. Tommasi and co-authors in the Journal of\
 (line 45) Comparative Physiology, ”. . . [but] it remains to be determined how the chicks actually\
 measure distances in the task.”\
 We never determined how our first chickens knew their new home was theirs, either.\
 We never knew how they managed to discern the boundaries of our property. But they\
 did. At first, they liked to stay near the coop. But as they grew, they took to following me\
 (line 50) everywhere, first cheeping like the tinkling of little bells, later clucking in animated adult\
 discussion. If I was hanging out the laundry, they would check what was in the laundry\
 basket. If I was weeding a flower bed, they would join me, raking the soil with their\
 strong, scaly feet, then stepping backward to see what was revealed. (Whenever I worked\
 with soil, I suspect they assumed I was digging for worms.) When my husband, Howard,\
 (line 55) and I would eat at the picnic table under the big silver maple, the Ladies would\
 accompany us. When my father-in-law came to help my husband build a pen for\
 Christopher Hogwood, then still a piglet, the Ladies milled underfoot to supervise every\
 move. The hens were clearly interested in the project, pecking at the shiny nails, standing\
 tall to better observe the use of tools, clucking a running commentary all the while. Before\
 (line 60) this experience, Howard’s dad would have been the first to say that he didn’t think\
 chickens were that smart. But they changed his mind. After a few hours I noticed he\
 began to address them. Picking up a hammer they were examining, he might say, directly\
 and respectfully, “Pardon me, Ladies”—as if he were speaking to my mother-in-law and\
 me when we got in the way.\
 (line 65) But when their human friends are inside, and this is much of the time, the Ladies\
 explore on their own. A chicken can move as fast as nine miles an hour, which can take\
 you pretty far, and ours are free to go anywhere they like. But ours have intuited our\
 property lines and confine their travels to its boundaries. They have never crossed the\
 street. And for years, they never hopped across the low stone wall separating our land\
 (line 70) from that of our closest neighbor. That came later—and it was not the result of any\
 physical change in the landscape, but the outcome of a change in social relationships\
 among their human friends.\
How does the author’s attitude toward the chickens change from the beginning of the passage to the end?\
(A) It varies from fear for their safety to gratitude for winning over the author’s father-in-law.\
 (B) It shifts from being uncertain about their abilities to being amazed at their complex ways.\
 (C) As she observes the behavior of the chickens, she realizes their learning keeps pace with the risks they take.\
 (D) As she gains confidence in her ability to raise her chickens, she comes to appreciate their self-sufficiency.\

Reading Comprehension Passage A\
 \
 Screeno\
 In the following passage, Cornelius Schmidt seeks refuge from a gloomy, rainy night by going to a movie. \
 \
 …At the door [of the theater] the uniformed ticket taker gave him a card on which was \
 printed a kind of checkerboard, having in each box a number. It was obviously the old game \
 of Lotto, the object being to get five numbers which were successive either horizontally or\
 vertically or in a diagonal. In the center, amid numbered boxes, was a box entitled\
 (line 5) GRATIS; (GRATIS - free, a space that could count as any number called) the management gave this box to the audience. …\
    The theatre fell into a semi-darkness, not the movie darkness, but one in which discreet\
 lights shone on both sides of the theatre and both sides of the stage. A white and pink\
 clockface flashed on the screen. It was, in fact, like a roulette wheel, and had numbers\
 running from 1 to 100. In the center was a pointer, which suddenly began to whirl furiously \
 (line 10) about the clockface, and then slowed down, and then stopped.\
    \"Ninety-nine!\" said the businesslike yet airy young man in an authoritative voice.\
 An usher wrote down the number upon a blackboard to the right of the screen. The pointer \
 spun again, at a tremendous pace, so that it was almost a moving blur for a moment, and\
 then clarified into its arrow-like straightness. The actual wheel was, of course, in the\
 (line 15) projection room.\
    \"Fifty-four!\" said the young master of ceremonies, simulating a dramatic tone.\
    \"SCREENO!\" cried a voice from the balcony in a mocking voice, while everyone\
 laughed, for obviously no one could have SCREENO as yet.\
    \"I am sorry, ladies and gentlemen,\" said the young man in an affable (affable - friendly) voice,\" but we will \
 (line 20) have to ask you not to be humorous about this. After all, money is involved, and there has\
 been much confusion in the past because various people insisted upon trying to be\
 funny.\"…\
    The pointer was revolving again. \"Thirty-nine!\" announced the young man. The\
 audience was not yet warmed up, because too few numbers had been called for anyone to \
 (line 25) be on the verge of winning. Cornelius, however, also had this third number and was pleased \
 no little by the course of events.\
    \"Forty-nine!\" announced the young man. …\
    \"Fourteen!\" cried the young man into the microphone which made his voice even more\
 official than otherwise. Cornelius did not have the number. He assured himself that the\
 (line 30) game was a fraud, that the management was obviously not going to permit anyone to win so \
 much money and that the whole business would obviously be controlled in the projection \
 room or by arranging the numbers on the cards. There was only one more chance, a drop\
 in the ocean. He slouched back in his seat, chiding himself for his great excitement. …\
    \"Twenty-five!\" the master of ceremonies called out.\
 (line 35)    \"Twenty-five! Twenty-five!\" said Cornelius to himself, and then, finding the number on\
 his card as the fifth consecutive horizontal number, he rose in his seat and shouted:\
    \"SCREENO!\" in a too loud voice which broke, and began to issue (to issue - to exit) from his aisle,\
 tripping over the feet of the people seated near him, some of whom were solicitous (solicitous - helpful) of his\
 walk, and eager to provide good advice as he passed. The attractiveness of the winner shone\
 (line 40) in him. …\
    An usher took his card, and checked it with the numbers on the blackboard. The young\
 man came over to oversee the usher. It seemed as if something was wrong, someone\
 had miscalculated, to look at the young man. The checking was done several times.\
 Very bureaucratic, said Cornelius to himself. Recovering, as the checkup proved that\
 (line 45) Cornelius had indeed won, he shook Cornelius’s hand and the whole theatre lighted up.\
    \"Lucky fellow,\" cried the balcony voice, amusing the audience again, by the envious\
 tone in his voice. …\
    The usher arrived with the money just as the persistent balcony voice called out,\
 \"Let’s go on with the show,\" and the audience began to clap again, wishing to have its\
 (line 50) chance at the other prizes.\
    But then, as the money was delivered to the young assistant manager, and he began\
 officiously to count it out, shuffle it, and arrange it, before paying Cornelius, a hoarse and \
 disused voice cried from the balcony:\
    \"SCREENO! SCREENO!\" …\
 (line 55)   \"SCREENO!\" came the voice again, this time nearer, as the new winner approached\
 the stairs from the balcony to the orchestra. The young assistant manager and the ushers \
 looked at each other in dismay. Something had obviously gone wrong, for usually no one\
 won the jackpot; two winners was inconceivable and would lead to bankruptcy. Someone\
 was going to lose his job because of this. …\
 (line 60)   \"My name is Casper Weingarten,\" said the old man, unasked, intruding himself upon\
 the huddle of the assistant manager and the ushers. He was very nervous, very excited.\
 \"I am a musician,\" he said, but no one paid any attention to him, except Cornelius.\
    And then the young assistant manager came over to the old man and, holding the card\
 up, showed him that he had not won, that he had mistaken a 7 for a 1 because the print had\
 (line 65) been on the left-hand side. \"Perhaps you’ll win one of the other prizes,\" he said,\
 courteously, \"since you already have four numbers in a row.\" …\
    Cornelius came over to look into the matter for himself. He took the card in his hand\
 and looked at the number in question. The old man looked at him, and then turned to the\
 assistant manager, saying:\
 (line 70)   \"Give me my money! I have won!\" …\
    \"Look here,\" said Cornelius tactfully to the assistant manager, \"it seems to me that you\
 can only assume that this is a 1. The blur is too faint to make it a seven.\"\
    \"I know it is a 7,\" said the assistant manager angrily, and when he said that, Cornelius\
 recognized immediately that he was so sure because the cards had been prepared in\
 (line 75) advance to obviate the possibility of two winners of the jackpot, or even one. Seeing this,\
 Cornelius began to feel sick and angry, as he always did when confronted with fraud or\
 cheating.\
    \"All my life I’ve been cheated,\" said the old man, wringing his hands. \"Give me my\
 money.\" An usher took his arm, as if to lead him from the stage, but the assistant manager\
 (line 80) deterred him, unwilling as yet to resort to force. …\
    \"My good man,\" said the assistant manager, \"Your hard luck is not my fault, nor this\
 theatre’s responsibility. Please do not cause a disturbance. Now if both of you will leave the\
 stage, we can go on with the other prizes and with the show.\"\
    In answer, the old man sat down upon the stage, looking grotesque there, with his head\
 (line 85) turned up. \"I will sit here until I am paid,\" he said tearfully. …\
    But the audience was won over, for no one wished to lose his chance at the remaining\
 $50. There was a murmuring of voices and someone cried out:\
    \"Go home and give us a chance.\" …\
    \"Call a cop,\" said another. …\
 (line 90)   Cornelius meditated with himself for a moment and then said: \"Listen, I will give you\
 half of the jackpot. Come on before you’re arrested.\" …\
    \"No,\" said Weingarten, \"I don’t want your money. I want mine. Give me my money,\"\
 he said towards the assistant manager.\
    Cornelius considered matters with himself again and came to a decision. Easy come,\
 (line 95) easy go, he said to himself, and then he told the old musician that he could have the whole\
 jackpot. The manager protested immediately, but Cornelius took the bills from his pocket\
 and began to count them out and give them to the musician, who accepted them with\
 a guilty look and trembling hands.\
    The audience saw what was happening and applauded vigorously, not because it was\
 (line 100) genuinely moved, but because it felt that it ought to applaud. Such applause is heard at\
 public gatherings when an abstraction too vacuous (vacuous - insincere) is mentioned or tribute is paid to a man\
 long dead. The assistant manager, trying to move in on Cornelius’s credit, came over to\
 shake hands with Cornelius. Cornelius, tempted to reject the proffered hand, accepted it\
 because he wished to cause no further disturbance.\
 (line 105)   The old man had risen and come over to Cornelius.\
    \"Thank you very much for your kindness,\" he said in the estranged voice of those who\
 have been weeping or overexcited.\
    \"Not at all,\" said Cornelius formally. Both descended from the stage together. …\

The Diving Horse\
 by John B. Abbott, Jr.\
 \
 Fall of 1959. That was the year Fidel Castro seized power in Cuba; Alaska and Hawaii\
 joined the Union as our 49th and 50th states, respectively; and Gunsmoke reigned as the\
 top TV series. Charlton Heston collected an Academy Award for Ben-Hur, and Leon Uris’s\
 Exodus topped the reading lists. In Garwood, New Jersey, a child picked up his favorite\
 (line 5) Golden Books (Golden Books were known as Little Golden Books, a popular series of children’s books that had gold-foil bindings.) and stood outside of his parents’ apartment building, waiting for the\
 school bus. What a sight: a chubby boy in black high-top Keds, jeans, and a flannel shirt,\
 patiently waiting and watching for the bus that, when it finally did rumble down Willow\
 Avenue, passed him by. The driver didn’t think to stop, which made perfect sense since\
 her route schedule didn’t include three-year-olds—not even three-year-old me.\
 (line 10) “The bus didn’t stop for me,” I complained to my mother that day.\
 “Oh, really?” she calmly replied. Later she would say that the only surprise was\
 the age at which I wanted to start going to school. But it shouldn’t have surprised her\
 really, because as the son of a pair of avid readers, I grew up in a house abundant with\
 opportunities to read and write. Newspapers, magazines, television, and radio were\
 (line 15) always available.\
 When I finally reached school age and the bus did stop, high drama and adventure\
 made up most of my extracurricular reading. I would read and reread Classics Illustrated\
 comics, and authors like Daniel Defoe, Mark Twain, Arthur Conan Doyle, Washington\
 Irving, Edgar Rice Burroughs, and Frank W. Dixon. I also enjoyed Superman and Batman\
 (line 20) comic books and even went through a MAD magazine phase. Sometimes Mom had to\
 chase me out of the house after school to play, because I would have rather just stayed in\
 my room and read.\
 I wasn’t much on writing until I was enrolled in a Catholic school, St. Bernard’s.\
 There, the nuns were stereotypically tough but thorough educators. In third grade, I\
 (line 25) labored long and hard with Sister Mary, and while it was her thoroughness that led to my\
 discovering that I loved to write, it was a horse—the Diving Horse of Atlantic City—that\
 sparked a lifetime passion for writing.\
 At the beginning of that school year, Sister Mary had assigned to us the ubiquitous\
 essay about summer vacation. That summer, my family had taken a day trip to the\
 (line 30) original Steel Pier in Atlantic City to see the famous Diving Horse. How my parents\
 learned of the horse, I don’t know, but as a family that took all its vacations by automobile,\
 no doubt they were alert for local-yet-unusual attractions. Atlantic City must have been\
 appealing; in the 1960s, there were no casinos or nightlife per se—unless you count Frank\
 Sinatra, Jr.—but the town was mostly known for its family-oriented amusements and the\
 (line 35) tradition of Bert Parks crooning his welcome to Miss America. But for us, Bert paled in\
 comparison to the Diving Horse. So off we went in the white ’64 Pontiac to climb aboard\
 carnival rides and eat hamburgers.\
 Thinking back on that day, I remember the windburn I got on my forearms from the\
 cool salty breeze off the Atlantic—a first for me. And to this day, I can’t go to the Jersey\
 (line 40) Shore without bringing home a box of fresh saltwater taffy.\
 But above all, I remember anxiously getting bleacher seats to see the Diving Horse. As\
 we took our seats, the horse, with a fellow named Arnette Webster (The author’s recollection of the diver appears to be inaccurate. Arnette French, a woman who performed in horse diving shows, stopped performing in 1935.) (clad in a rubber wet\
 suit) on its back, was about to jump from a platform roughly 30 feet high into a pool. I\
 recall staring at the odd sight of a horse standing as calmly as you please on a platform\
 (line 45) above a pool just like the kind I swam in at my Aunt Anne and Uncle Leo’s house. To a\
 recorded drumroll and cymbal crash, Webster urged the horse forward, and the two fell\
 through space to make the biggest splash I’d ever seen—even bigger than the cannonballs\
 my uncle could make in his own pool! Wow! And then both horse and rider surfaced,\
 though for the life of me, I can’t recall how they got out of the pool.\
 (line 50) So two months later, when Sister Mary gave us the essay assignment, it was easy . . . as\
 easy as falling into a pool.\
 Looking at the Diving Horse essay some 40 years later, it’s apparent how much I must\
 have enjoyed writing about the experience. I put a lot of energy into trying to describe the\
 windburn, the taffy, and the horse, which, to my eight-year-old eyes, must have been\
 (line 55) suitable for a Valkyrie to ride. But in that essay, I did something that I imagine no other\
 child in the class did: I ended my piece with a rhetorical question. I wrote, “How would\
 you like to go to Atlantic City?”\
 Small as that detail was, Sister Mary must have noticed it. And she must have\
 encouraged me to keep writing, because with that essay, I learned something about myself.\
 (line 60) I learned that I loved to write.\
 It was at that age, as my father has confirmed, that I started to write stories, not just\
 read them. I soon took to writing as I had taken to reading. I wrote about monsters,\
 superheroes, and what could pass for a fourth-grader’s version of a mystery. Superman\
 never had it so easy foiling the best-laid plans of Lex Luthor, and my detectives—not as\
 (line 65) articulate as Sherlock Holmes, but as savvy—somehow always managed to catch the bad\
 guys and still remember to say “Thank you.”\
 Even now, when many of my workdays at Rutgers University are done, Rex Stout,\
 Mark Twain, Arthur Conan Doyle, and Superman are still often at the center of my\
 recreational reading. And when I write a mystery, whatever thread each of my various\
 (line 70) detectives picks up and untangles, something inside reminds me of the chubby kid with\
 the glasses urging the horse to “Jump! Jump!”\
 In terms of distance, it was about 30 feet. In terms of writing, it was a leap of\
 a lifetime.\

Talking with Artists:\
 David Wiesner\
 compiled and edited by Pat Cummings\
 MY STORY\
 (paragraph 1) I think that I always knew I wanted to become an artist. I can't remember a time when I wasn't drawing and painting pictures. My oldest sister and my brother were artistic, and watching them draw fascinated me. They had many different art supplies around the house. There was, and still is, something very appealing about art materials: Boxes of pastels, with incredibly colored, thin, square sticks, fitting snugly into the slots in their trays. Little ink bottles with rubber stoppers and pens with interchangeable metal tips. The look, smell, and feel of rich black ink going onto bright white paper in broad, flat strokes or thin, sharp lines. I found this captivating.\
 (paragraph 2) In our town, the housepaint and wallpaper store also sold art supplies. I loved looking at all the exotic things they had for sale. Sandpaper blocks to sharpen pencils. Rows of numbered pencils, and erasers that could be pulled ike taffy. Thin drawers full of tubes of paint that seemed so much more grown up than the kind we used at school. Complicated easels and wooden boxes to hold everything.\
 (paragraph 3) My parents and friends soon saw that I had more than a passing interest in art. It came to define much of my image. Relatives gave me art-related birthday gifts. At school I became \"the kid who could draw\", a unique distinction, like \"brainiest\" or \"best athlete\"-but somehow different. A little weird, actually. I like that.\
 (paragraph 4) In my kindergarten class, we had an \"art corner\". There was an easel with a large pad of paper and poster paints. One day I was painting a picture of a red house. I can vividly recall my intense frustration because this picture just didn't look like I wanted it to.\
 (paragraph 5) As I got a little older, I began copying pictures: cartoons, comic books, and magazine illustrations. But mostly dinosaurs. I loved them. The World Book Encyclopedia published a book about the history of the earth, full of very realistic dinosaur pictures that I drew over and over again. They were in black and white and had a hazy quality to them (bad printing, I think). For a long time, even after I should have known better, I thought they were photographs of dinosaurs.\
 (paragraph 6) I found out a few years ago that these particular paintings are murals in the Chicago Field Museum. I've since seen them in person. They were painted by Charles Knight, the first and most famous painter of dinosaurs. They are still impressive, and they are in color!\
 (paragraph 7) My third-grade class wrote essays on what we wanted to be when we grew up. To me it was obvious. We read them aloud, and I told about the types of paintings I would some day try. I'd have turtles with paintbrushes tied to their backs walking around on a big sheet of paper (I got chuckles from the class and the teacher). Or I'd fill squirt guns with different colored paints and shoot at the canvas. I actually tried this with friends! Well, it sounded like a good idea.\
 (paragraph 8) One of the only discouraging childhood experiences about my artwork happened in the fourth grade. During study time I was drawing a picture. My teacher took it away and wrote an angry note home to my mother. \"David would rather be drawing pictures than doing his work!!!\" I couldn't believe it, three exclamation points. We didn't get along well for the rest of the year. School \"art classes\" were pretty uninspiring. I did my best work on textbook covers I made. Art never seemed to be taken as seriously as other subjects.\
 (paragraph 9) In the eighth grade, a big career day was held. Months before, we wrote suggestions for careers we wanted to hear about. On the big day, guest speakers from many fields came to talk. We each chose two sessions to attend, but there wasn't one that came close to an art-related field. I saw some guy talk about oceanography.\
 (paragraph 10) In high school it actually sank in that I was going to be an artist. My friends read catalogs and saw guidance counselors to pick what they'd study in college. I felt something was wrong. I already knew. I'd always known. I half expected to hear, \"No, put away those paints and choose a real career.\" My parents were excited about my choice, too. As I looked into art schools, I felt like doors were being thrown wide open. Until then my art was a private thing, but at art school I found a place where everyone was \"the kid who could draw.\"\
Read this sentence from paragraph 10.\
 As I looked into art schools, I felt like doors were being thrown wide open.\
 What does the phrase \"doors were being thrown wide open\" suggest?\
(A) Wiesner had always known that he would go to art school.\
 (B) Wiesner's parents decided to allow him to attend art school.\
 (C) Wiesner found that art school offered many possibilities.\
 (D) Wiesner was invited by a large number of art schools.\

Excerpt from Wheels of Change: How Women Rode the Bicycle to Freedom (With a Few Flat Tires Along the Way)\
 by Sue Macy\
 \
 (paragraph 1) Women’s rights crusader Elizabeth Cady Stanton was in her eighties during the\
 heyday of the bicycle, and no evidence exists to show that she actually ever rode one.\
 But there was no better or more eloquent advocate for women and the wheel. In 1895,\
 Stanton contributed an article to the American Wheelman celebrating this “wonderful\
 new style of locomotion.” In the article, titled “The Era of the Bicycle,” she pointed out\
 that cycling was increasing people’s mobility, eliminating the cost of feeding and\
 housing horses, and encouraging the building of good roads. However, she saved her\
 greatest praise for the bicycle’s effects on women. “The bicycle,” she wrote, “will inspire\
 women with more courage, self-respect and self-reliance and make the next generation\
 more vigorous of mind and of body; for feeble mothers do not produce great\
 statesmen, scientists and scholars.”\
 (paragraph 2) For all the practical benefits of the two-wheeler, the fact is that it brought about a\
 cosmic shift in women’s private and public lives. With the rise of industry and the\
 move from a rural to an urban economy in the 19th century, American women had\
 become increasingly confined to their homes. Young girls could play outside, but when\
 they matured, their freedom of movement was greatly restricted. “At sixteen years of\
 age, I was enwrapped in the long skirts that impeded every footstep,” remembered\
 Frances Willard, who in 1895 wrote a best-selling account of how she learned to ride a\
 bicycle at age 53. “I have detested walking and felt with a certain noble disdain that the\
 conventions of life had cut me off from what . . . had been one of life’s sweetest joys.”\
 (paragraph 3) While wealthier women were saddled with long skirts and restrictive corsets, those\
 who were less well off worked anonymously in mills and factories. All in all, the result\
 was the same. Except in a few instances, the public image of America was male.\
 Politicians, soldiers, business leaders, and even the leading athletes in the new sports of\
 baseball and football were all men. But the bicycle changed that. Suddenly, women\
 were leaving their homes to cycle and socialize on country roads and city streets.\
 Bicycle racers such as Louise Armaindo and Frankie Nelson had their exploits splashed\
 all over the papers. Bicycle manufacturers, intent on mining an untapped market,\
 showed female models in their advertisements. Thanks to the wheel, women were\
 starting to be seen and heard in public life.\
 (paragraph 4) It was not a stretch for some cyclists to see the possibility of a larger role for women\
 in the world. When she conquered the wheel, Frances Willard was a former university\
 president and the longtime president of the Woman’s Christian Temperance Union,\
 which fought to prohibit the use of alcoholic beverages and to win women the right to\
 vote. Willard saw parallels between learning to ride and learning to live. “I began to feel\
 that myself plus the bicycle equaled myself plus the world, upon whose spinning wheel\
 we must all learn to ride,” she wrote. “He who succeeds, or, to be more exact in handing\
 over my experience, she who succeeds in gaining the mastery of [a bicycle], will gain\
 the mastery of life.”\
 (paragraph 5) For decades, Willard, along with Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Susan B. Anthony, and\
 many others, had been working toward increased political and economic rights for\
 women. Now the bicycle brought a taste of independence to women on a very personal\
 level, and some of them took the opportunity to express their discontent with old\
 traditions and expectations. In August 1895, a cyclist named Ann Strong caused a stir\
 when she compared the value of a bicycle to that of a husband in the Minneapolis\
 Tribune. “I can’t see but that a wheel is just as good company as most husbands,” she\
 declared. “I would as lief (lief: happily) talk to one inanimate object as another; and I’d a great deal\
 rather talk to one that can’t answer than one that won’t.” Strong then contrasted the joy\
 of cycling with the challenges of raising a family. “You can make your wheel tidy over\
 night,” she said, “and it never kicks off its shoes the very last minute, and never smears\
 itself with molasses. When you are ready you can start. No little elbows are stuck in\
 your ribs; there is no wiggling; screams at the cars or at the candy stores. You glide\
 along, silently, smoothly, swiftly.”\
 (paragraph 6) Some stated the liberating effects of the bicycle with less sarcasm. “The bicycle has\
 brought to women a healthful, wholesome means of securing a degree of freedom and\
 independence that no amount of discussion regarding ‘women’s rights’ would ever\
 have produced,” wrote the L.A.W. Bulletin and Good Roads magazine in 1898.\
 Meanwhile, Munsey’s Magazine assessed the impact of the wheel on women in a\
 special bicycle-themed issue. “If she has ridden her bicycle into new fields, becoming in\
 the process a new creature, it has been gradually and unconsciously,” the editors wrote.\
 (paragraph 7) “She did not have to be born again in some mysterious fashion, becoming a strange\
 creature, a ‘new woman.’ She is more like the ‘eternal feminine,’ who has taken on\
 wings, and who is using them with an ever increasing delight in her new power.”\
 Indeed, many bicycle companies at home and abroad did put wings on the women in\
 their advertisements, emphasizing that they had taken flight.\
 (paragraph 8) Not all publications treated the emergence of the “new woman” with the same level\
 of approval. Some mocked her, while others just seemed baffled by her. Her new way of\
 dressing, in bloomers or divided skirts or skirts with shortened hems, certainly\
 disturbed the old social order, but so did her confidence and daring. These traits led\
 commentators to worry that the differences between the sexes were being blurred, a\
 fear that was reinforced as the four newest states—Wyoming, Colorado, Utah, and\
 Idaho—granted women the right to vote in the 1890s. Would the bicycle help bring\
 about a new kind of equality between men and women? Elizabeth Cady Stanton and\
 her colleagues certainly hoped so. At any rate, the image of a female cyclist quickly\
 became associated with efforts to win more rights for women.\
Which quotation best expresses the central idea of the article?\

 (B) “Suddenly, women were leaving their homes to cycle and socialize on country roads and city streets.” (paragraph 3)\

 Reading Comprehension Passage A\
 \
 Caramelo\
 \
    One would think now that she was living in Chicago, in the same city as her [favorite son] \
 Inocencio, the Grandmother would find happiness. But no, that wasn’t the case. The \
 Grandmother was meaner than ever. She was unhappy. And didn’t know she was unhappy, \
 the worst kind of unhappiness of all. As a result, everyone was in a hurry to find her a house\
 (line 5) of some sort. A bungalow, a duplex, a brownstone, an apartment. Something, anything, \
 because the Grandmother’s gloominess was the contagious kind, infecting every member of \
 the household as fiercely as the bubonic plague. \
    Because Baby [Inocencio’s brother] and Ninfa’s apartment had room to accommodate \
 a guest, it was understood the Grandmother would stay with them until she could find a \
 (line 10) house of her own. This had seemed all well and fine when the plans were made long-\
 distance with Uncle Baby shouting into the receiver that he insisted, that he and Ninfa \
 wouldn’t think of her staying anywhere else, that the girls were thrilled she was coming. But \
 now that she was actually sleeping in [granddaughter] Amor’s narrow bed with radios and \
 televisions chattering throughout the apartment, and doors and cupboards banging, and the \
 (line 15) stink of cigarettes soaking into everything, even her skin, and trucks rumbling past and \
 shaking the building like an earthquake, and sirens and car horns at all hours, well, it just \
 about drove her crazy; even the rowdy Chicago wind, a rough, moody brute who took one \
 look at you and laughed. …\
    All day and all night the expressway traffic whooshed past, keeping the Grandmother\
 (line 20) awake. She napped when she could, even when the apartment and its inhabitants jabbered \
 the loudest. She was tired all the time, and yet she had trouble sleeping, often waking once \
 or twice in the early morning, and in her sleeplessness, padding in her house slippers to the \
 living room, where the front windows looked out onto the lanes of traffic, the expressway \
 billboards, and the frighteningly grimy factories beyond. The trucks and cars, furious to get\
 (line 25) from here to there, never paused for a moment, the sound of the expressway almost not a \
 sound at all, but a roar like the voice of the sea trapped inside a shell. \
    She pressed her forehead against the cold glass and sighed. If the Grandmother had \
 consulted her feelings, she would’ve understood why it was taking her so long to buy a new \
 house and settle in Chicago, but she was not a woman given to reflection. She missed her\
 (line 30) old house too much and was too proud to admit she’d made a mistake. She couldn’t go \
 backward, could she? She was stuck, in the middle of nowhere it seemed, halfway between \
 here and where? \
    The Grandmother missed the routine of her mornings, her three-minute eggs and \
 bolillo (bolillo - crunchy roll) breakfasts. She missed rubbing her big toe along the octagon tiles of her bathroom \
 (line 35) floor. But most of all, she missed her own bed with its mattress sagging in the center, the \
 familiar scent and weight of her blankets, the way morning entered gradually from the left\
 as the sun climbed over the east courtyard wall, the one topped with a cockscomb (cockscomb -rooster’s crown with jagged edges) of glass \
 shards to keep out the thieves. Why do we get so used to waking up in a certain room? And \
 when we aren’t in our own bed and wake up in another, a terrible fear for a moment, like\
 (line 40) death.\
    There is nothing worse than being a houseguest for too long, especially when your host\
 is a relative. The Grandmother felt like a prisoner. She hated climbing up the three flights\
 of stairs, and always arrived clutching her heart, convinced she was having an attack, like\
 the one that killed Narciso [her husband]. Really, once she was upstairs, she couldn’t even\
 (line 45) bear the thought of coming back down. What a barbarity! …\
    To visit Chicago is one thing, to live there another. This was not the Chicago of her\
 vacations, where one is always escorted to the lake shore, to the gold coast, driven along the\
 winding lanes of traffic of Lake Shore Drive in the shadow of beautiful apartment buildings,\
 along State Street and Michigan Avenue to window-shop at least. And perhaps taken on an\
 (line 50) excursion on the lake. How is it she hadn’t noticed the expression of the citizens, not the\
 ones fluttering in and out of taxis, but the ones at bus stops, hopping like sparrows, shivering\
 and peering anxiously for the next bus, and those descending wearily into the filthy bowels\
 of the subway like the souls condemned to purgatory.(purgatory - place of suffering)\
    At first the Grandmother was thrilled by the restaurants and the big discount chains—\
 (line 55) but then the routine got to be too familiar. Saturdays in search of houses that were not to\
 her liking. Dark brick houses with small, squinty windows, gloomy apartments, or damp\
 little bungalows, everything somber and sad and not letting in enough light, and no\
 courtyards, a dank, (dank - damp) mean gangway, a small patch of thin grass called a garden, and maybe a\
 bald tree in front. This wasn’t what she had in mind.\
 (line 60)   And as the weeks and months passed, and she was still without a house, the rainy, cold\
 autumn weather began and only made her feel worse. There was the Chicago winter\
 coming that everyone had warned her about, and she was already so cold and miserable she\
 didn’t feel much like leaving her room, let alone the building. She blamed Ninfa, who kept\
 lowering the heat in order to save money. The Grandmother confined herself to bed,\
 (line 65) satisfied only when she was under several layers of blankets. …\
    But nothing, nothing in the Grandmother’s imagination prepared her for the horrors of\
 a Chicago winter. It was not the picturesque (picturesque - charming) season of Christmas, but the endless tundra\
 of January, February, and March. Daylight dimmed to a dull pewter. (pewter - gray) The sun a thick piece\
 of ice behind a dirty woolen sky. It was a cold like you can’t imagine, a barbarous thing, a\
 (line 70) knife in the bone, a cold so cold it burned the lungs if one could even believe such a cold.\
 And the mountains of filthy snow shoveled in huge heaps, the chunks of ice on the sidewalk\
 that could kill an aged citizen. —Oh, this is nothing, you should’ve been here for the Big\
 Snow, the grandchildren bragged, speaking of the recent storm of ’68.\
    Big snow or little snow, it was all the same after the novelty of snow had worn off. A\
 (line 75) nuisance, a deadly thing, an exaggerated, long, drawn-out ordeal that made one feel like\
 dying, that killed one slowly, a torture. Let me die in February, let me die rather than have\
 to step out the door again, please, the Grandmother thought to herself, dreading having to\
 dress like a monster to go outside. —Ay, ya no puedo. I can’t anymore, I can’t. And just\
 when she could no longer, when she could no longer find the strength, the drive, the will to\
 (line 80) keep on living, when she was ready to fold into herself and let her spirit die, just then, and\
 only then, did April arrive with sky the color of hope and branches filled with possibilities.\

What Do Flies Think About?\
 From Ideas & Discoveries Magazine\
 \
 It seems unbelievable, but an insect’s brain is more brilliant than any supercomputer.\
 That’s why researchers are studying flies and bees to understand their cognition. Food for\
 thought . . .\
 Though it may seem like a mundane question, there is serious science behind it: Why\
 (line 5) is a common housefly able to land on a ceiling? After all, the insect flies with its feet down\
 when it’s below the ceiling, yet, in the blink of an eye, the fly is suddenly perched with feet\
 upward. The explanation for the fly’s aerial feat is important because it can reveal a lot\
 about what the insect’s brain is capable of: Regardless of how the fly manages the landing,\
 its tiny brain (which consists of only 100,000 nerve cells) has to go into high gear to carry\
 (line 10) it out. For a long time, scientists believed the flies turn around in flight much like a fighter\
 pilot performs loops. This would require them to first “visualize” a mental rotation—in\
 other words, to plan the loop beforehand.\
 It was only recently that researchers discovered how a fly actually lands on a ceiling.\
 Using a high-speed camera, they discovered that flies don’t perform a loop after all.\
 (line 15) Instead, they stretch out their front legs over their head and toward the ceiling. As soon as\
 the legs make contact with the ceiling, the fly swings its body around 180 degrees like a\
 gymnast on a horizontal bar. Then it simply attaches itself to the ceiling with all its legs.\
 This precision landing requires perfect coordination of all its muscles. The fly’s swinging\
 motion also needs to be calculated, which means information shoots through its body in\
 (line 20) the space of milliseconds. Not even an autopilot system controlled by a high-tech\
 computer could carry out such a maneuver.\
 Bees are a favorite experimental creature for researchers because they are easy to breed\
 and are considered the “Einsteins” of the insect world. These striped geniuses perform\
 intellectual feats that cannot be taken for granted, even among mammals. Bees can count,\
 (line 25) distinguish between objects like humans and dogs, recognize complex shapes, learn things,\
 navigate across great distances and remember their routes, and return to their hives and\
 tell other bees exactly where the tastiest flowers are. Compare that with the difficulties\
 humans can have when finding their way around an unfamiliar city without a map—not\
 to mention having to describe to friends the route they took. “Brain size is not necessarily\
 (line 30) an indicator of intelligence,” says bee researcher Lars Chittka at Queen Mary, University of\
 London. “Larger brains usually utilize the same circuits over and over again. This might\
 make for more detailed thinking or remembering, but it doesn’t guarantee the thoughts or\
 memories will be better.”\
 Bees are also social insects that create complex colony systems and display a high\
 (line 35) degree of social behavior. The idea of life in a group is firmly rooted in their brains—\
 which is what makes bees so interesting to brain researchers. We, too, are social creatures,\
 after all, and scientists suspect that certain neuronal circuits have changed very little over\
 the course of evolution. In other words, bee brains could provide us with information on\
 nerve connections that will help us better understand our own human nature and how we\
 (line 40) think.\
 Researchers already know that insects living in groups need to have more computing\
 power in their head. This is illustrated by the fact that all social insects have a larger brain\
 than their loner counterparts. A key factor in this discovery was a study conducted by\
 biologists at a Smithsonian lab in Panama. The country is home to a bee species that\
 (line 45) contains some members that live alone and others that form groups. The biologists\
 discovered that the loner bees also had a smaller brain. So it appears that a larger brain is\
 a consequence of group living. The same phenomenon is even more pronounced among\
 several species of locusts that begin life alone and later join up to form giant swarms: As\
 soon as they get together, their brains begin to grow by one-third. It’s likely they need to\
 (line 50) possess greater thinking capacity in order to compete with rivals in the swarm. It’s also\
 likely that flying and communicating in a swarm is more difficult than doing those things\
 alone. The biologists still don’t know how locusts get their brains to grow. The\
 explanation, should it be found, might be of interest to medical researchers looking into\
 treatments for paralysis or strokes. In any case, the researchers have found substances in\
 (line 55) the locusts’ brain that are extremely effective at killing bacteria. These substances are not\
 related to any known antibiotics, so they could possibly pave the way for new medications\
 in the future.\
 Such discoveries are definitely pointing scientists in a new direction. However,\
 practically no insect brain researcher has gone as far as Atsushi Takashima at the Tokyo\
 (line 60) Institute of Technology in Japan. Takashima has inserted electrodes into the brains of male\
 moths that he then uses as control units for a robot. Whenever the moth-machine hybrid\
 catches the scent of a female moth, it begins to search for the source. “Chemical\
 substances do not spread out uniformly in air,” Takashima explains. “So even though their\
 concentrations increase as you get closer to their source, the effects of wind and air\
 (line 65) currents make an analysis extremely difficult. But thanks to evolution, insect brains have\
 developed techniques to get around this problem.” Takashima’s research has significant\
 applications: His goal is to create robots that can sniff out explosives or dangerous\
 chemicals in the air and locate their source. One day a processor will control such robots,\
 but for now, a moth’s brain is far superior to any supercomputer on the market.\
Which evidence from the article best supports the claim in lines 41 and 42?\
(A) “Larger brains usually utilize the same circuits over and over again.” (line 31)\
 (B) “The idea of life in a group is firmly rooted in their brains—which is what makes bees so interesting to brain researchers.” (lines 35 and 36)\
 (C) “We, too, are social creatures, after all, and scientists suspect that certain neuronal circuits have changed very little over the course of evolution.” (lines 36 through 38)\

In the very heart of Tokyo sits the imperial palace, site of the former Edo Castle. Inside a colossal moat with ramparts that dwarf anything seen in Europe, vast open spaces enclose the last fragments of one of the world’s most imposing seventeenth-century monuments. Across the globe in France, Louis XIV’s palace and gardens of Versailles form a similar impression of artificial mastery of nature and society. Miles of formal gardens punctuated [decorated] with fountains and statuary surround a palace known for its cold magnificence, with the entire ensemble of town, palace, and park orienting itself around a single, central focal point: the Sun King’s bedroom. Each complex symbolizes a system of power. Edo evokes [brings to mind] the Tokugawa rule by status, which decreed that the daimyo lords, who were themselves forced to spend alternate years in Edo away from their regional domains, lived administratively and spatially segregated from the various other categories of subjects, all ranged in a pattern of residential sectors spiraling around the castle. Versailles, in similar fashion, bespeaks [indicates] the domestication of the French aristocracy in a “gilded cage,” where they scrambled for favors while the Sun King undermined their authority and deprived them of their independence. . . .\

Reading Comprehension Passage C\
 \
 “The Russell-Einstein Manifesto,” signed by a group of eleven intellectuals and scientists including Bertrand Russell and Albert Einstein, was written at the height of the Cold War.\
 \
 In the tragic situation which confronts humanity, we feel that scientists should\
 assemble in conference to appraise the perils that have arisen as a result of the development\
 of weapons of mass destruction, and to discuss a resolution in the spirit of the appended\
 draft.\
 \
 (line 5) We are speaking on this occasion, not as members of this or that nation, continent, or\
 creed, but as human beings, members of the species Man, whose continued existence is in\
 doubt. The world is full of conflicts; and, overshadowing all minor conflicts, the titanic\
 struggle between Communism and anti-Communism. …\
 \
 We have to learn to think in a new way. We have to learn to ask ourselves, not what steps\
 (line 10) can be taken to give military victory to whatever group we prefer, for there no longer are\
 such steps; the question we have to ask ourselves is: what steps can be taken to prevent a\
 military contest of which the issue must be disastrous to all parties? …\
 \
 No doubt in an H-bomb (H-bomb — hydrogen bomb) war great cities would be obliterated. But this is one of the\
 minor disasters that would have to be faced. If everybody in London, New York, and\
 (line 15) Moscow were exterminated, the world might, in the course of a few centuries, recover from\
 the blow. But we now know, especially since the Bikini test, (Bikini test — reference to an American test of a hydrogen bomb conducted at the Bikini Atoll in the Pacific Ocean on March 1st, 1954. The bomb sent radioactive debris across the globe) that nuclear bombs can\
 gradually spread destruction over a very much wider area than had been supposed. …\
 \
 Many warnings have been uttered by eminent men of science and by authorities in\
 military strategy. None of them will say that the worst results are certain. What they do say\
 (line 20) is that these results are possible, and no one can be sure that they will not be realized. We\
 have not yet found that the views of experts on this question depend in any degree upon\
 their politics or prejudices. They depend only, so far as our researches have revealed, upon\
 the extent of the particular expert’s knowledge. We have found that the men who know most\
 are the most gloomy.\
 \
 (line 25) Here, then, is the problem which we present to you, stark and dreadful and inescapable:\
 Shall we put an end to the human race; or shall mankind renounce war? People will not face\
 this alternative because it is so difficult to abolish war.\
 \
 The abolition of war will demand distasteful limitations of national sovereignty. But\
 what perhaps impedes understanding of the situation more than anything else is that the\
 (line 30) term “mankind” feels vague and abstract. People scarcely realize in imagination that the\
 danger is to themselves and their children and their grandchildren, and not only to a dimly\
 apprehended humanity. They can scarcely bring themselves to grasp that they, individually,\
 and those whom they love are in imminent (imminent — about to take place) danger of perishing agonizingly. And so they\
 hope that perhaps war may be allowed to continue provided modern weapons are\
 (line 35) prohibited.\
 \
 This hope is illusory. Whatever agreements not to use H-bombs had been reached in\
 time of peace, they would no longer be considered binding in time of war, and both sides\
 would set to work to manufacture H-bombs as soon as war broke out, for, if one side\
 manufactured the bombs and the other did not, the side that manufactured them would\
 (line 40) inevitably be victorious.\
 \
 Although an agreement to renounce nuclear weapons as part of a general reduction of\
 armaments would not afford an ultimate solution, it would serve certain important purposes.\
 First: any agreement between East and West is to the good in so far as it tends to diminish\
 tension. Second: the abolition of thermo-nuclear weapons, if each side believed that the\
 (line 45) other had carried it out sincerely, would lessen the fear of a sudden attack in the style of\
 Pearl Harbour, which at present keeps both sides in a state of nervous apprehension. We\
 should, therefore, welcome such an agreement, though only as a first step.\
 \
 Most of us are not neutral in feeling, but, as human beings, we have to remember that,\
 if the issues between East and West are to be decided in any manner that can give any\
 (line 50) possible satisfaction to anybody, whether Communist or anti-Communist, whether Asian or\
 European or American, whether White or Black, then these issues must not be decided by\
 war. We should wish this to be understood, both in the East and in the West.\
 \
 There lies before us, if we choose, continual progress in happiness, knowledge, and\
 wisdom. Shall we, instead, choose death, because we cannot forget our quarrels? We\
 (line 55) appeal, as human beings, to human beings: Remember your humanity, and forget the rest.\

 Resolution\
 \
 We invite this Congress, (Congress — the group of scientists who signed the Manifesto) and through it the scientists of the world and the general\
 public, to subscribe to the following resolution:\
 \
 (line 60) “In view of the fact that in any future world war nuclear weapons will certainly be\
 employed, and that such weapons threaten the continued existence of mankind, we urge\
 the Governments of the world to realize, and to acknowledge publicly, that their\
 purpose cannot be furthered by a world war, and we urge them, consequently, to find\
 peaceful means for the settlement of all matters of dispute between them.”\
 \
 —Bertrand Russell\
 excerpted from “The Russell–Einstein Manifesto”\
 July 9, 1955\
The “Resolution” stated in lines 58 through 64 serves to\
(1) advise the Congress to debate the proposal\
 (2) stress the importance of non-military solutions to conflicts\
 (3) demand the elimination of weapons of mass destruction\
 (4) condemn the Governments that violate the Manifesto\

Excerpt from Snowflake Bentley\
 by Jacqueline Briggs Martin\
 \
 (paragraph 1) In the days when farmers worked with ox and sled and cut the dark with lantern light, there lived a boy who loved snow more than anything in the world. Willie Bentley’s happiest days were snowstorm days. He watched snowflakes on his mittens, on the dried grass of Vermont farm fields, on the dark metal handle of the barn door. He said snow was as beautiful as butterflies, or apple blossoms.\
 \
 (paragraph 2) He could net butterflies and show them to his older brother, Charlie. He could pick apple blossoms and take them to his mother. But he could not share snowflakes because he could not save them.\
 \
 (paragraph 3) When his mother gave him an old microscope, he used it to look at flowers, raindrops, and blades of grass. Best of all, he used it to look at snow. While other children built forts and pelted snowballs at roosting crows, Willie was catching snowflakes. Day after stormy day he studied the icy crystals.\
 \
 (paragraph 4) Their intricate patterns were even more beautiful than he had imagined. He expected to find whole flakes that were the same, that were copies of each other. But he never did. Willie decided he must find a way to save snowflakes so others could see their wonderful designs. For three winters he tried drawing snow crystals. They always melted before he could finish.\
 \
 (paragraph 5) When he was sixteen, Willie read of a camera with its own microscope. “If I had that camera I could photograph snowflakes,” he told his mother. Willie’s mother knew that he would not be happy until he could share what he had seen.\
 \
 (paragraph6) “Fussing with snow is just foolishness,” his father said. Still, he loved his son. When Willie was seventeen his parents spent their savings and bought the camera. It was taller than a newborn calf, and cost as much as his father’s herd of ten cows. Willie was sure it was the best of all cameras.\
 \
 (paragraph 7) Even so his first pictures were failures—no better than shadows. Yet he would not quit. Mistake by mistake, snowflake by snowflake, Willie worked through every storm. Winter ended, the snow melted, and he had no good pictures. He waited for another season of snow. One day, in the second winter, he tried a new experiment. And it\
 worked! Willie had figured out how to photograph snowflakes! “Now everyone can see the great beauty in a tiny crystal,” he said.\
 \
 (paragraph 8) But in those days, no one cared. Neighbors laughed at the idea of photographing snow. “Snow in Vermont is as common as dirt,” they said. “We don’t need pictures.” Willie said the photographs would be his gift to the world. While other farmers sat by the fire or rode to town with horse and sleigh, Willie studied snowstorms. He stood at the shed door and held out a black tray to catch the flakes.\
 \
 (paragraph 9) When he found only jumbled, broken crystals, he brushed the tray clean with a turkey feather and held it out again. He waited hours for just the right crystal and didn’t notice the cold. If the shed were warm the snow would melt. If he breathed on the black tray the snow would melt. If he twitched a muscle as he held the snow crystal on the long wood pick the snowflake would break. He had to work fast or the snowflake would evaporate before he could slide it into place and take its picture. Some winters he was able to make only a few dozen good pictures. Some winters he made hundreds. . . .\
 \
 (paragraph 10) But his snow crystal pictures were always his favorites. He gave copies away or sold them for a few cents. He made special pictures as gifts for birthdays. He held evening slide shows on the lawns of his friends. Children and adults sat on the grass and watched while Willie projected his slides onto a sheet hung over a clothesline.\
 \
 (paragraph 11) He wrote about snow and published his pictures in magazines. He gave speeches about snow to faraway scholars and neighborhood skywatchers. “You are doing great work,” said a professor from Wisconsin. The little farmer came to be known as the world’s expert on snow, “the Snowflake Man.” But he never grew rich. He spent every\
 penny on his pictures. Willie said there were treasures in snow. “I can’t afford to miss a single snowstorm,” he told a friend. “I never know when I will find some wonderful prize.”\
What does the information in paragraph 9 suggest about the author’s point of view?\

 (B) The author respects Bentley’s many different interests.\

Clash of the Condiments: Wasabi vs. the Chili Pepper\
 by Mary Beth Cox\
 \
 Most condiments are peaceable enough. The sauces, spreads, and pickles of the world\
 add flavor to our foods without kicking up much of a fuss. This is not true of the pungent\
 or “hot’’ condiments. They are more aggressive. They get our attention by purposely\
 causing us pain. These strong-armed seasonings are often the source of friendly\
 (line 5) competitions. Loyal fans will contend that their favorite pungent condiment is the one that\
 packs the most powerful punch. Ladies and gentlemen, you are cordially welcomed to just\
 such a contest. Here it is, the Match of the Moment: Wasabi vs. the Chili Pepper.\
 IN YOUR CORNERS\
 Introducing in the Green Corner, hailing from the island nation of Japan, sushi’s\
 inseparable sidekick: Wasabi! Wasabia japonica grows wild on the cool, damp banks of\
 (line 10) Japan’s many mountain streams. The chill of its habitat is quite ironic since wasabi is\
 famous for bringing the heat. The plant is a botanical relative of mustard and horseradish.\
 Pungency runs in the family. Traditionally, wasabi is prepared by grating its rootstock on\
 the abrasive skin of an angel shark. Authentic wasabi is relatively rare and difficult to\
 come by. The emerald condiment that is served outside of Japan is almost always\
 (line 15) horseradish pulp dyed with green food coloring. Whether the wasabi is real or whether it’s\
 the more common substitute, a whopping snootful will make you cry for your momma!\
 And in the red corner, originating from the Central and South Americas, now an\
 international culinary superstar: the Chili Pepper. Chili peppers are fruits of the plants of\
 the botanical genus Capsicum. They are related to the tomato and the eggplant. They’re\
 (line 20) the renegades in an otherwise mild-mannered botanical family. Chili peppers include but\
 are not limited to the poblano, the cayenne, the jalapeño, the tabasco, the habanero, and\
 the serrano. One of these culprits sometimes goes by the alias “chipotle.’’ A chipotle\
 (pronounced chee-POHT-lay) is none other than a dried smoked jalape ño. Chilies were\
 introduced to the non-American world by Christopher Columbus, who mistakenly\
 (line 25) identified them as variants of black pepper. Chilies have since taken the culinary world by\
 storm. They appear alongside dishes served around the globe, from the Basque provinces\
 to North Africa and the Middle East, to India and Southeast Asia. A potent chili pepper in\
 the kisser will make you rue the day you were born!\
 POWERFUL PUNCHES\
 Both wasabi and chilies are condiments of world-class pungency. But how do they\
 (line 30) match up head to head? Each has its own unique tactical move. Each has its own special\
 point of attack. The active ingredient of the wasabi plant is stored stealthily in its cells.\
 Under normal growing conditions, this ingredient is completely harmless. It’s not until the\
 plant’s cells are ruptured (as by the grating action of angel shark skin) that the trouble\
 begins. Enzymes convert the ingredient into molecules of allyl isothiocyanate. It’s the\
 (line 35) chemical characteristics of these irritating molecules that are the secret to wasabi’s\
 pungency. Allyl isothiocyanate molecules are lightweight. They are volatile. They are also\
 soluble in water. As a consequence, the consumption of wasabi launches an airborne\
 assault on the consumer’s sinuses. Allyl isothiocyanate molecules waft up the nose and\
 back of the throat. They dissolve in the watery fluids they find there. They intercept nerve\
 (line 40) endings in the nasal passages. Specifically, these molecules target pain receptors of the\
 type known as TRPA I . TRPA I receptors respond to the attack by sending emergency\
 signals to the brain: “Yikes . . . we’ve gotten hold of something painfully hot!’’\
 Chili peppers conduct operations of a different sort. Their active ingredient is a\
 substance called capsaicin. It’s found in the spongy inner tissue of peppers, but it can leak\
 (line 45) onto the seeds and inner wall of the fruit. Capsaicin molecules are heavier than the\
 molecules of wasabi’s allyl isothiocyanate. They are not volatile. They prefer to dissolve in\
 oils, so they aren’t as easily dissolved in water. Capsaicin molecules instigate an incendiary\
 assault upon contact with exposed vulnerable surfaces. They cling to the tender tissues of\
 the lips, mouth, and throat. They burn eyes that are rubbed with capsaicin-laced fingers.\
 (line 50) Capsaicin molecules interact with pain receptors of the type TRPV I. Again an alert is\
 expedited to the brain: “Mayday! Mayday! Let’s not eat any more of that, please!’’\
 WHERE’S THE REFEREE?\
 So which of these condiments causes the most pain? To settle any contest, a scoring\
 system is required. There is a way to compare the relative heat intensities of the various\
 chili peppers. It’s called the Scoville scale. Scoville ratings are determined by brave human\
 (line 55) test subjects who willingly sip extracts of chili pepper juice. Extracted juices are diluted\
 again and again until their heat can no longer be detected. A high rating on the Scoville\
 scale means that a lot of dilutions are necessary to eliminate the pain caused by a\
 particular pepper. Unfortunately, Scoville ratings are not applicable to wasabi. The method\
 is specifically designed to extract capsaicin from chili peppers. It doesn’t work for allyl\
 (line 60) isothiocyanate, or for anything else.\
 Pepper pungencies are also compared by using chromatography. Chromatography is an\
 analytical technique that separates the chemical components of a mixture. After\
 separation, the amounts of each component are quantified. Chromatography can\
 determine how much capsaicin is in a pepper. It can also determine how much allyl\
 (line 65) isothiocyanate is in wasabi. If two chili peppers have the same amount of capsaicin, it can\
 be assumed that those peppers are equally “hot.’’ But the same assumption cannot be made\
 when comparing chili peppers to wasabi. There’s no way to know if equal amounts of\
 capsaicin and allyl isothiocyanate cause equal degrees of pain. So chromatography cannot\
 definitively judge this contest.\
 (line 70) It isn’t even possible to directly measure and compare nerve responses, since\
 two different types of pain receptors are involved. Wasabi and chili peppers are like\
 pungent apples and oranges. There’s no objective way to declare one more potent than the\
 other. This friendly competition won’t be settled anytime soon. Everyone is free to chime\
 in with an opinion. You just have to try both of these pungent powerhouses, then root for\
 (line 75) your own favorite flavor of pain.\
The Scoville scale determines the strength of the heat in chili peppers by\
(A) counting the number of sips of chili pepper juice a human subject can consume\
 (B) recording the amount of capsaicin present in specific amounts of chili pepper juice\
 (C) measuring how much chili pepper juice must be weakened for it to no longer cause pain\
 (D) comparing descriptions of the heat a human subject feels while drinking chili pepper juice\

Reading Comprehension Passage A\
 \
 …It was so cold that his first breath turned to iron in his throat, the hairs in his nostrils\
 webbed into instant ice, his eyes stung and watered. In the faint starlight and the bluish\
 luminescence of the snow everything beyond a few yards away swam deceptive and without\
 depth, glimmering with things half seen or imagined. Beside the dead car he stood with his\
 (line 5) head bent, listening, and there was not a sound. Everything on the planet might have died\
 in the cold. …\
 \
 But here he stood in light overcoat and thin leather gloves, without overshoes, and his\
 car all but blocked the road, and the door could not be locked, and there was not a\
 possibility that he could carry the heavy cases with him to the next farm or village. He\
 (line 10) switched on the headlights again and studied the roadside they revealed, and saw a rail\
 fence, with cedars and spruces behind it. When more complex gadgets and more complex\
 cures failed, there was always the lucifer match (lucifer match — a match that ignites through friction).\
 \
 Ten minutes later he was sitting with the auto robe over his head and shoulders and his\
 back against the plowed snowbank, digging the half melted snow from inside his shoes and\
 (line 15) gloating over the growing light and warmth of the fire. He had a supply of fence rails good\
 for an hour. In that time, someone would come along and he could get a push or a tow. In\
 this country, in winter, no one ever passed up a stranded motorist. …\
 \
 Abruptly he did not want to wait in that lonely snow-banked ditch any longer. The\
 sample cases (sample cases — cases of medicine samples) could look after themselves, any motorist who passed could take his own\
 (line 20) chances. He would walk ahead to the nearest help, and if he found himself getting too cold\
 on the way, he could always build another fire. The thought of action cheered him; he\
 admitted to himself that he was all but terrified at the silence and the iron cold. …\
 \
 Turning with the road, he passed through the stretch of woods and came into the open\
 to see the moon-white, shadow-black buildings of a farm, and the weak bloom of light in a\
 (line 25) window. …\
 \
 “Hello?” he said, and knocked again. “Anybody home?” No sound answered him. He\
 saw the moon glint on the great icicles along the eaves. His numb hand ached with the pain\
 of knocking; he pounded with the soft edge of his fist.\
 \
 Answer finally came, not from the door before which he stood, but from the barn, down\
 (line 30) at the end of a staggered string of attached sheds. A door creaked open against a snowbank\
 and a figure with a lantern appeared, stood for a moment, and came running. The traveler\
 wondered at the way it came, lurching and stumbling in the uneven snow, until it arrived at\
 the porch and he saw that it was a boy of eleven or twelve. The boy set his lantern on the\
 porch; between the upturned collar of his mackinaw (mackinaw — type of warm coat) and the down-pulled stocking cap his\
 (line 35) face was a pinched whiteness, his eyes enormous. He stared at the traveler until the traveler\
 became aware of the blanket he still held over head and shoulders, and began to laugh.\
 \
 “My car stopped on me, a mile or so up the road,” he said. “I was just hunting a\
 telephone or some place where I could get help.”\
 \
 The boy swallowed, wiped the back of his mitt across his nose. “Grandpa’s sick!” he\
 (line 40) blurted, and opened the door. …\
 \
 “He must’ve had a shock,” the boy said. “I came in from chores and he was on the floor.”\
 He stared at the mummy under the quilt, and he swallowed. …\
 \
 “Why didn’t you go for help?”\
 \
 The boy looked down, ashamed. “It’s near two miles. I was afraid he’d.…”\
 \
 (line 45) “But you left him. You were out in the barn.”\
 \
 “I was hitching up to go,” the boy said. “I’d made up my mind.”\
 \
 The traveler backed away from the stove, his face smarting (smarting — stinging) with the heat, his fingers\
 and feet beginning to ache. He looked at the old man and knew that here, as at the car, he\
 was helpless. The boy’s thin anxious face told him how thoroughly his own emergency had\
 (line 50) been swallowed up in this other one. He had been altered from a man in need of help to\
 one who must give it. Salesman of wonder cures, he must now produce something to calm\
 this over-worried boy, restore a dying man. Rebelliously, victimized by circumstances, he\
 said, “Where were you going for help?”\
 \
 “The Hill place. They’ve got a phone.”\
 \
 (line 55) “How far are they from a town?”\
 \
 “About five miles.”\
 \
 “Doctor there?”\
 \
 “Yes.”\
 \
 “If I took your horse and—what is it, sleigh?—could someone at the Hills’ bring them\
 (line 60) back, do you think?”\
 \
 “Cutter (cutter — a small horse-drawn sled). One of the Hill boys could, I should say.”\
 \
 “Or would you rather go, while I look after your Grandpa?”\
 \
 “He don’t know you,” the boy said directly. “If he should wake up he might … wonder\
 … it might.…”\
 \
 (line 65) The traveler grudgingly gave up the prospect of staying in the warm kitchen while the\
 boy did the work. And he granted that it was extraordinarily sensitive of the boy to know\
 how it might disturb a man to wake from sickness in his own house and stare into the face\
 of an utter stranger. “Yes,” he said. “Well, I could call the doctor from the Hills’. Two miles,\
 did you say?” …\
 \
 (line 70) He climbed into the cutter and pulled over his lap the balding buffalo robe he found\
 there; the scallop (scallop — curve) of its felt edges was like a key that fitted a door. The horses breathed jets\
 of steam in the moonlight, restlessly moving, jingling their harness bells, as the moment\
 lengthened itself. The traveler saw how the boy, now that his anxiety was somewhat quieted,\
 now that he had been able to unload part of his burden, watched him with a thousand\
 (line 75) questions in his face, and he remembered how he himself, thirty years ago, had searched\
 the faces of passing strangers for something he could not name, how he had listened to their\
 steps and seen their shadows lengthen ahead of them down roads that led to unimaginable\
 places, and how he had ached with the desire to know them, who they were. But none of\
 them had looked back at him as he tried now to look at this boy. …\
 \
 (line 80) For half a breath he was utterly bewitched, frozen at the heart of some icy dream.\
 Abruptly he slapped the reins across the backs of the horses; the cutter jerked and then slid\
 smoothly out toward the road. The traveler looked back once, to fix forever the picture of\
 himself standing silently watching himself go. As he slid into the road the horses broke into\
 a trot. The icy flow of air locked his throat and made him let go the reins with one hand to\
 (line 85) pull the hairy, wool-smelling edge of the blanket all but shut across his face.\
 \
 Along a road he had never driven he went swiftly toward an unknown farm and an\
 unknown town, to distribute according to some wise law part of the burden of the boy’s\
 emergency and his own; but he bore (bore — carried) in his mind, bright as moonlight over snow, a vivid\
 wonder, almost an awe. For from that most chronic and incurable of ills, identity, he had\
 (line 90) looked outward and for one unmistakable instant recognized himself.\
 \
 —Wallace Stegner\

The final paragraph contributes to a central idea by suggesting that the traveler\
(1) realizes he must forget the past to move forward\
 (2) regrets the way he treated strangers in the past\
 (3) discovers he can help himself by assisting a stranger\
 (4) accepts that he must struggle for success\

This is the true story of a Kenyan woman named Wangari Maathai.\
 \
 Excerpt from Seeds of Change:\
 Planting a Path to Peace\
 \
 by Jen Cullerton Johnson\
 \
 (paragraph 1) “Come,” Wangari’s mother called. She beckoned her young daughter over to a tall tree with a wide, smooth trunk and a crown of green, oval leaves.\
 \
 (paragraph 2) “Feel,” her mother whispered.\
 \
 (paragraph 3) Wangari spread her small hands over the tree’s trunk. She smoothed her fingers over the rough bark.\
 \
 (paragraph 4) “This is the mugumo,” her mother said. “It is home to many. It feeds many too.”\
 \
 (paragraph 5) She snapped off a wild fig from a low branch, and gave it to her daughter. Wangari ate the delicious fruit, just as geckos and elephants did. High in the tree, birds chirped in their nests. The branches bounced with jumping monkeys.\
 \
 (paragraph 6) “Our people, the Kikuyu of Kenya, believe that our ancestors rest in the tree’s shade,” her mother explained.\
 \
 (paragraph 7) Wangari wrapped her arms around the trunk as if hugging her great-grandmother’s spirit. She promised never to cut down the tree. . . .\
 \
 ((paragraph 8) When Wangari finished elementary school, she was eleven years old. Her mind was like a seed rooted in rich soil, ready to grow. Wangari wanted to continue her education, but to do so she would have to leave her village and move to the capital city of Nairobi. Wangari had never been farther than her valley’s ridge. She was scared.\
 \
 (paragraph 9) “Go,” her mother said. She picked up a handful of earth and placed it gently into her daughter’s hand. “Where you go, we go.” . . .\
 \
 (paragraph 10) As graduation neared, Wangari told her friends she wanted to become a biologist.\
 \
 (paragraph 11) “Not many native women become biologists,” they told her.\
 \
 (paragraph 12) “I will,” she said.\
 \
 (paragraph 13) Wangari watched sadly as her government sold more and more land to big companies that cut down forests for timber and to clear land for coffee plantations. Native trees such as cedar and acacia vanished. Without trees, birds had no place to nest. Monkeys lost their swings. Tired mothers walked miles for firewood. . . .\
 \
 (paragraph 14) When Wangari visited her village she saw that the Kikuyu custom of not chopping down the mugumo trees had been lost. No longer held in place by tree roots, the soil streamed into the rivers. The water that had been used to grow maize, bananas, and sweet potatoes turned to mud and dried up. Many families went hungry.\
 \
 (paragraph 15) Wangari could not bear to think of the land being destroyed. Now married and the mother of three children, she worried about what would happen to the mothers and children who depended on the land.\
 \
 (paragraph 16) “We must do something,” Wangari said.\
 \
 (paragraph 17) Wangari had an idea as small as a seed but as tall as a tree that reaches for the sky. “Harabee! Let’s work together!” she said to her countrywomen—mothers like her. Wangari dug deep into the soil, a seedling by her side. “We must plant trees.” . . .\
 \
 (paragraph 18) Wangari traveled to villages, towns, and cities with saplings and seeds, shovels and hoes. At each place she went, women planted rows of trees that looked like green belts across the land. Because of this they started calling themselves the Green Belt Movement.\
 \
 (paragraph 19) “We might not change the big world but we can change the landscape of the forest,” she said.\
 \
 (paragraph 20) One tree turned to ten, ten to one hundred, one hundred to one million, all the way up to thirty million planted trees. Kenya grew green again. Birds nested in new trees. Monkeys swung on branches. Rivers filled with clean water. Wild figs grew heavy in mugumo branches.\
 \
 (paragraph 21) Mothers fed their children maize, bananas, and sweet potatoes until they could eat no more.\
Which sentence most likely expresses Wangari’s point of view?\
(A) People can make the changes they want by working together with determination.\
 (B) People change their traditions and customs with each generation.\
 (C) People cannot rely on the government to help them in a time of need.\
 (D) People in other countries do not need to work as hard on the same\
 problem.\

What Do Flies Think About?\
 From Ideas & Discoveries Magazine\
 \
 It seems unbelievable, but an insect’s brain is more brilliant than any supercomputer.\
 That’s why researchers are studying flies and bees to understand their cognition. Food for\
 thought . . .\
 Though it may seem like a mundane question, there is serious science behind it: Why\
 (line 5) is a common housefly able to land on a ceiling? After all, the insect flies with its feet down\
 when it’s below the ceiling, yet, in the blink of an eye, the fly is suddenly perched with feet\
 upward. The explanation for the fly’s aerial feat is important because it can reveal a lot\
 about what the insect’s brain is capable of: Regardless of how the fly manages the landing,\
 its tiny brain (which consists of only 100,000 nerve cells) has to go into high gear to carry\
 (line 10) it out. For a long time, scientists believed the flies turn around in flight much like a fighter\
 pilot performs loops. This would require them to first “visualize” a mental rotation—in\
 other words, to plan the loop beforehand.\
 It was only recently that researchers discovered how a fly actually lands on a ceiling.\
 Using a high-speed camera, they discovered that flies don’t perform a loop after all.\
 (line 15) Instead, they stretch out their front legs over their head and toward the ceiling. As soon as\
 the legs make contact with the ceiling, the fly swings its body around 180 degrees like a\
 gymnast on a horizontal bar. Then it simply attaches itself to the ceiling with all its legs.\
 This precision landing requires perfect coordination of all its muscles. The fly’s swinging\
 motion also needs to be calculated, which means information shoots through its body in\
 (line 20) the space of milliseconds. Not even an autopilot system controlled by a high-tech\
 computer could carry out such a maneuver.\
 Bees are a favorite experimental creature for researchers because they are easy to breed\
 and are considered the “Einsteins” of the insect world. These striped geniuses perform\
 intellectual feats that cannot be taken for granted, even among mammals. Bees can count,\
 (line 25) distinguish between objects like humans and dogs, recognize complex shapes, learn things,\
 navigate across great distances and remember their routes, and return to their hives and\
 tell other bees exactly where the tastiest flowers are. Compare that with the difficulties\
 humans can have when finding their way around an unfamiliar city without a map—not\
 to mention having to describe to friends the route they took. “Brain size is not necessarily\
 (line 30) an indicator of intelligence,” says bee researcher Lars Chittka at Queen Mary, University of\
 London. “Larger brains usually utilize the same circuits over and over again. This might\
 make for more detailed thinking or remembering, but it doesn’t guarantee the thoughts or\
 memories will be better.”\
 Bees are also social insects that create complex colony systems and display a high\
 (line 35) degree of social behavior. The idea of life in a group is firmly rooted in their brains—\
 which is what makes bees so interesting to brain researchers. We, too, are social creatures,\
 after all, and scientists suspect that certain neuronal circuits have changed very little over\
 the course of evolution. In other words, bee brains could provide us with information on\
 nerve connections that will help us better understand our own human nature and how we\
 (line 40) think.\
 Researchers already know that insects living in groups need to have more computing\
 power in their head. This is illustrated by the fact that all social insects have a larger brain\
 than their loner counterparts. A key factor in this discovery was a study conducted by\
 biologists at a Smithsonian lab in Panama. The country is home to a bee species that\
 (line 45) contains some members that live alone and others that form groups. The biologists\
 discovered that the loner bees also had a smaller brain. So it appears that a larger brain is\
 a consequence of group living. The same phenomenon is even more pronounced among\
 several species of locusts that begin life alone and later join up to form giant swarms: As\
 soon as they get together, their brains begin to grow by one-third. It’s likely they need to\
 (line 50) possess greater thinking capacity in order to compete with rivals in the swarm. It’s also\
 likely that flying and communicating in a swarm is more difficult than doing those things\
 alone. The biologists still don’t know how locusts get their brains to grow. The\
 explanation, should it be found, might be of interest to medical researchers looking into\
 treatments for paralysis or strokes. In any case, the researchers have found substances in\
 (line 55) the locusts’ brain that are extremely effective at killing bacteria. These substances are not\
 related to any known antibiotics, so they could possibly pave the way for new medications\
 in the future.\
 Such discoveries are definitely pointing scientists in a new direction. However,\
 practically no insect brain researcher has gone as far as Atsushi Takashima at the Tokyo\
 (line 60) Institute of Technology in Japan. Takashima has inserted electrodes into the brains of male\
 moths that he then uses as control units for a robot. Whenever the moth-machine hybrid\
 catches the scent of a female moth, it begins to search for the source. “Chemical\
 substances do not spread out uniformly in air,” Takashima explains. “So even though their\
 concentrations increase as you get closer to their source, the effects of wind and air\
 (line 65) currents make an analysis extremely difficult. But thanks to evolution, insect brains have\
 developed techniques to get around this problem.” Takashima’s research has significant\
 applications: His goal is to create robots that can sniff out explosives or dangerous\
 chemicals in the air and locate their source. One day a processor will control such robots,\
 but for now, a moth’s brain is far superior to any supercomputer on the market.\
What information best develops the view that bees are “the ‘Einsteins’ of the insect world” (line 23)?\
(A) the discussion about the larger brain sizes of bees\
 (B) the list of intellectual feats that bees can accomplish\
 (C) the reasons that researchers are interested in studying bees\
 (D) the information about the complex colonies that bees live in\

Base your answers to questions 1 and 2 on the passage below and on your knowledge of social studies.\
 \
 The Edo period followed many years of political and social upheaval. The previous division of Japanese history known as the Sengoku period (warring states period) was dominated by wars fought between various political and religious factions for the control of the country. These wars came to an end with the unification of Japan by the great generals Oda Nobunaga and Toyotomi Hideyoshi and eventually Tokugawa Ieyasu who formed Japan’s final Shogunate.\
 Ieyasu consolidated his power through a series of social changes including the introduction of a strict class system and the tight control of the ruling daimyo families from the capital city Edo. Individuals had no legal rights and the family became very important at all social levels.…\

Reading Comprehension Passage B\
 \
 Ithaka (Ithaka - In the epic, The Odyssey, it took Odysseus 10 years to return to his Greek island home of Ithaka after\
 winning the Trojan war)\
 \
 As you set out for Ithaka\
 hope the voyage is a long one,\
 full of adventure, full of discovery.\
 Laistrygonians and Cyclops, (Laistrygonians and Cyclops - monsters that Odysseus encountered on his journey home)\
 (line 5) angry Poseidon (Poseidon - the Greek god of the sea who sought to punish Odysseus for harming his son, a Cyclops)—don’t be afraid of them:\
 you’ll never find things like that on your way\
 as long as you keep your thoughts raised high,\
 as long as a rare excitement\
 stirs your spirit and your body.\
 (line 10) Laistrygonians and Cyclops,\
 wild Poseidon—you won’t encounter them\
 unless you bring them along inside your soul,\
 unless your soul sets them up in front of you.\
 \
 Hope the voyage is a long one.\
 (line 15) May there be many a summer morning when,\
 with what pleasure, what joy,\
 you come into harbors seen for the first time;\
 may you stop at Phoenician trading stations\
 to buy fine things,\
 (line 20) mother of pearl and coral, amber and ebony,\
 sensual perfume of every kind—\
 as many sensual perfumes as you can;\
 and may you visit many Egyptian cities\
 to gather stores of knowledge from their scholars.\
 \
 (line 25) Keep Ithaka always in your mind.\
 Arriving there is what you are destined for.\
 But do not hurry the journey at all.\
 Better if it lasts for years,\
 so you are old by the time you reach the island,\
 (line 30) wealthy with all you have gained on the way,\
 not expecting Ithaka to make you rich.\
 \
 Ithaka gave you the marvelous journey.\
 Without her you would not have set out.\
 She has nothing left to give you now.\
 (line 35) And if you find her poor, Ithaka won’t have fooled you.\
 Wise as you will have become, so full of experience,\
 you will have understood by then what these Ithakas mean.\

Base your answers to questions 44 through 47 on the reading passage below and on your knowledge of Earth science.\
 \
 Roche Moutonée\
 A roche moutonée is a glacial landscape feature produced as an advancing glacier slides over a hill of surface bedrock. As the glacier advances up the side of the hill, the surface bedrock is abraded and smoothed by rock fragments carried within the base of the glacial ice, creating a more gentle hillslope. As the glacier advances down the opposite side of the hill, chunks of bedrock are broken off and removed by the ice, a process called glacial quarrying (plucking), making this side of the hill steeper. The resulting hill resembles a drumlin, except it is often smaller and is composed of solid bedrock.\
The formation of a roche moutonée by glaciers is best described as an example of\
(1) chemical weathering\
 (2) physical weathering\
 (3) sediment deposition\
 (4) mass movement\

Excerpt from Humans With Amazing Senses\
 \
 When bats go out to hunt, they send out sonar signals at such high frequencies and in\
 such rapid bursts that they can hear the signals bounce off mosquitoes in midair. They\
 then zero in on the insects like laser-guided missiles. Dolphins use the same technique to\
 find their dinners. It’s called echolocation, a technique that uses sound to identify objects\
 (line 5) by the echoes they produce.\
 Fourteen-year-old Ben Underwood of Sacramento, Calif., is one of the few people\
 known to use echolocation as a primary means of navigating the world on land. There’s\
 not even a hint of light reaching his brain. His eyes are artificial, but his brain has adapted\
 to allow him to appraise his environment. He makes a “clicking” sound to communicate\
 (line 10) with objects and people around him.\
 Scientists have discovered that in the brains of the blind, the visual cortex has not\
 become useless, as they once believed. When blind people use another sense—touch or\
 hearing, for example—to substitute for sight, the brain’s visual cortex becomes active, even\
 though no images reach it from the optic nerve. Echolocation creates its own images.\
 (line 15) “I can hear that wall behind you over there. I can hear right there—the radio, and the\
 fan,” Ben says.\
 Ben says every object in his life talks to him in ways that no one else can hear\
 or understand.\
 Forty-year-old Daniel Kish of Long Beach, Calif., also uses echolocation, and has\
 (line 20) become an expert on it, founding the World Access for the Blind, an organization that\
 teaches others how to echolocate. Kish leads other blind people on mountain biking tours\
 and hikes in the wilderness, visualizing and describing the picturesque sights around him\
 through echolocating.\
 Clicking to Do Anything\
 If you listen closely to Ben or Kish, you can hear how they find their way. Ben says he\
 (line 25) can distinguish where the curbs are as he cruises his neighborhood streets.\
 He can find the pole and the backboard on a basketball goal, and tell which is which\
 by the distinctive echo each makes. Even though he can’t see the goal he’s aiming for, he\
 can sink a basket. Ben doesn’t remember how or when he began clicking, but he’s\
 developed his abilities to such an extent that aside from echolocation, he can rapidly\
 (line 30) discriminate the sounds in video games.\
 Ben lost his sight when he was 2. He was diagnosed with cancer in both eyes, and\
 when chemotherapy failed, his mother, Aquanetta Gordon, was left with one option: For\
 her son to live, both his eyes had to be surgically removed.\
 Gordon remembers her son after the operation.\
 (line 35) “He woke up and he said, ‘Mom, I can’t see anymore, I can’t see anymore.’ And I took\
 his hands and I put them on my face and I said, ‘Baby, yes, you can see.’ I said, ‘You can\
 see with your hands.’ And then I put my hand on his nose and I said, ‘You smell me? You\
 can see with your nose and your ears. . . . You can’t use your eyes anymore, but you have\
 your hands and your nose and your ears.’ ”\
 (line 40) In a house already filled with three other children, Ben’s mother decided not to treat\
 his blindness as a handicap. In school, Ben recognizes his classmates by their voices. With\
 the help of Braille books and a talking laptop computer, Ben attends the same classes as\
 sighted students.\
 Rich Mental Images, Without Visual Elements\
 Like Ben, Kish also lost his eyesight to cancer at age 1. He was raised to believe he\
 (line 45) could do pretty much anything, and he discovered clicking by accident as a child.\
 “I have mental images that are very rich, very complex. They simply do not possess\
 the visual element,” Kish says.\
 In retrieving those pictures, Kish varies the pace and volume of his clicks as he\
 walks along; and what he can tell you about an object’s qualities is sometimes\
 (line 50) astonishingly thorough.\
 If bats can distinguish prey as small as mosquitoes with echolocation, and some\
 dolphins can detect small targets a hundred yards away, what are the ultimate capabilities\
 of human beings like Ben and Kish?\
 Peter Scheifele, who studies hearing and sound production in animals and people at\
 (line 55) the University of Connecticut, analyzed samples of the clicks that Ben and Kish make.\
 “Ben clicks, looks to me like once every half second, whereas a dolphin is actually\
 making 900 clicks per second. And the bat is even faster than that,” Scheifele says.\
 The bottom line: Human beings send out sounds at much slower rates and lower\
 frequencies, so the objects people can picture with echolocation must be much larger than\
 (line 60) the ones bats and dolphins can find.\
Which statement expresses a central idea of the article?\
(A) Very few people use echolocation in their daily lives.\
 (B) Echolocation is a technique that can be utilized by humans.\
 (C) Echolocation has been studied by scientists for many years.\
 (D) Some animals are known for using echolocation to find food.\

Reading Comprehension Passage C\
 Many Animals Can Count, Some Better Than You\
 \
 Every night during breeding season, the male túngara frog of Central America will stake\
 out a performance patch in the local pond and spend unbroken hours broadcasting\
 his splendor to the world.\
 The mud-brown frog is barely the size of a shelled pecan, but his call is large and\
 (line 5) dynamic, a long downward sweep that sounds remarkably like a phaser weapon on\
 \"Star Trek,\" followed by a brief, twangy, harmonically dense chuck.(chuck - a clucking sound)\
 Unless, that is, a competing male starts calling nearby, in which case the first frog is\
 likely to add two chucks to the tail of his sweep. And should his rival respond likewise,\
 Male A will tack on three chucks.\
 (line 10) Back and forth they go, call and raise, until the frogs hit their respiratory limit at six\
 to seven rapid-fire chucks.\
 The acoustic one-upfrogship is energetically draining and risks attracting predators like\
 bats. Yet the male frogs have no choice but to keep count of the competition, for the simple\
 reason that female túngaras are doing the same: listening, counting and ultimately mating\
 (line 15) with the male of maximum chucks.\
 Behind the frog’s surprisingly sophisticated number sense, scientists have found, are\
 specialized cells in the amphibian midbrain that tally up sound signals and the intervals\
 between them.\
 \"The neurons are counting the number of appropriate pulses, and they’re highly\
 (line 20) selective,\" said Gary Rose, a biologist at the University of Utah. If the timing between\
 pulses is off by just a fraction of a second, the neurons don’t fire and the counting process\
 breaks down. …\
 Scientists have found that animals across the evolutionary spectrum have a keen sense\
 of quantity, able to distinguish not just bigger from smaller or more from less, but two from\
 (line 25) four, four from ten, forty from sixty.\
 Orb-weaving spiders, for example, keep a tally of how many silk-wrapped prey items are\
 stashed in the \"larder\" segment of their web. When scientists experimentally remove the\
 cache, the spiders will spend time searching for the stolen goods in proportion to how many\

 Three-spined sticklebacks (sticklebacks - carnivorous fish) are more discriminating still: with a contrast ratio of .86,\

 ‘one,’ and pointed to them and said, ‘three,’ and those words, in an odd, coarse way, would\
 have been understood.\"\
 (line 55) That continuity, Dr. Pagel added, \"should astonish us.\" …\
 Attitudes about animal numerosity have changed dramatically since the mid-twentieth\
 century when many researchers believed only humans had enough gray matter to think\
 quantitatively. They cited as an object lesson the 1907 case of Clever Hans, the horse that\
 supposedly could solve arithmetic problems and would tap out his answers by hoof; as it\
 (line 60) turned out, he was responding to unconscious cues from the people around him.\
 Since then, researchers have approached the field with caution and rigor, seeking to\
 identify the specific evolutionary pressures that might spur the need for numeric judgments\
 in any given species.\
 Social carnivores like spotted hyenas, for example, live in fission-fusion societies, (fission-fusion societies - animals whose social group composition and size change as they move throughout their environment)\
 (line 65) collectively defending their territories against rivals but in ever-shifting groups of widely\
 roaming members. \"You can never predict who you’ll find in which group,\" said Sarah\
 Benson-Amram, an assistant professor of zoology and physiology at the University of\
 Wyoming. \"You might be alone or in a group of ten.\"\
 Because hyena jaws can pulverize zebra bones, encounters between [rival hyena]\
 (line 70) competitors can prove deadly; every spotted hyena must have a good sense from moment\
 to moment of how many there are of us versus how many of them. Dr. Benson-Amram and\
 her colleagues tested hyena numerosity skills in the field, playing back the recorded whoops\
 of spotted hyenas living in South Africa and Namibia to hyenas in Kenya.\
 The Kenyan carnivores reacted to the whoops of strangers as predicted, approaching\
 (line 75)\
 the hidden source of the sound when they had a home team advantage, retreating when\
 they heard a few too many distinctive voices in a row. Or sometimes, when the local hyenas\
 were outnumbered, they’d call for backup. …\
 Chimpanzees are social scorekeepers, episodic (episodic - periodic) warriors and number ninjas, too.\
 They can be taught to associate groups of objects with corresponding Arabic numerals up\
 (line 80) to the number 9 and sometimes beyond — three squares on a computer screen with the\
 number 3, five squares with 5, and so on. They can put those numerals in order.\
 The numeric working memory of young chimpanzees is astonishing: Flash a random\
 scattering of numerals on a screen for just 210 milliseconds — half an eye blink — and then\
 cover the numbers with white squares, and a numerically schooled young chimpanzee will\
 (line 85) touch the squares sequentially to indicate the ascending order of the numbers hidden\
 beneath.\
 Don’t bother trying to do this yourself, Tetsuro Matsuzawa, a primatologist at Kyoto\
 University, said at the scientific meeting in London on which the themed journal (the themed journal - a publication where animal numerosity studies were discussed) was based.\
 \"You can’t.\" …\
 (line 90) Stanislas Dehaene, a psychologist at the University of Paris, and his colleagues\
 presented evidence from brain scans of professional mathematicians that the neural\
 circuitry (neural circuitry - nerve cells) for advanced mathematical thinking is an elaboration on the archaic (archaic - primitive) number sense\
 we share with other animals. …\
 We hear that the price of something rose by 50 percent and then fell by 50 percent, and\
 (line 95) we reflexively, mistakenly conclude, \"Oh good, we’re back to where we started.\" Our natural\
 number sense adds and subtracts whole numbers, whole chucks, guppies and hyenas.\
 But it really abhors a fraction, and so has led us astray.\

Reading Comprehension Passage C\
 Many Animals Can Count, Some Better Than You\
 \
 Every night during breeding season, the male túngara frog of Central America will stake\
 out a performance patch in the local pond and spend unbroken hours broadcasting\
 his splendor to the world.\
 The mud-brown frog is barely the size of a shelled pecan, but his call is large and\
 (line 5) dynamic, a long downward sweep that sounds remarkably like a phaser weapon on\
 \"Star Trek,\" followed by a brief, twangy, harmonically dense chuck.(chuck - a clucking sound)\
 Unless, that is, a competing male starts calling nearby, in which case the first frog is\
 likely to add two chucks to the tail of his sweep. And should his rival respond likewise,\
 Male A will tack on three chucks.\
 (line 10) Back and forth they go, call and raise, until the frogs hit their respiratory limit at six\
 to seven rapid-fire chucks.\
 The acoustic one-upfrogship is energetically draining and risks attracting predators like\
 bats. Yet the male frogs have no choice but to keep count of the competition, for the simple\
 reason that female túngaras are doing the same: listening, counting and ultimately mating\
 (line 15) with the male of maximum chucks.\
 Behind the frog’s surprisingly sophisticated number sense, scientists have found, are\
 specialized cells in the amphibian midbrain that tally up sound signals and the intervals\
 between them.\
 \"The neurons are counting the number of appropriate pulses, and they’re highly\
 (line 20) selective,\" said Gary Rose, a biologist at the University of Utah. If the timing between\
 pulses is off by just a fraction of a second, the neurons don’t fire and the counting process\
 breaks down. …\
 Scientists have found that animals across the evolutionary spectrum have a keen sense\
 of quantity, able to distinguish not just bigger from smaller or more from less, but two from\
 (line 25) four, four from ten, forty from sixty.\
 Orb-weaving spiders, for example, keep a tally of how many silk-wrapped prey items are\
 stashed in the \"larder\" segment of their web. When scientists experimentally remove the\
 cache, the spiders will spend time searching for the stolen goods in proportion to how many\
 separate items had been taken, rather than how big the total prey mass might have been.\
 (line 30) Small fish benefit from living in schools, and the more numerous the group, the\
 statistically better a fish’s odds of escaping predation. As a result, many shoaling (shoaling - shallow water) fish are\
 excellent appraisers of relative head counts.\

 distinguish at a glance between four guppies and five, or eight guppies and ten, and if given\

 they’re able to tell six fellow fish from seven, or 18 from 21 — a comparative power that\
 many birds, mammals and even humans might find hard to beat.\

Excerpt from Snowflake Bentley\
 by Jacqueline Briggs Martin\
 \
 (paragraph 1) In the days when farmers worked with ox and sled and cut the dark with lantern light, there lived a boy who loved snow more than anything in the world. Willie Bentley’s happiest days were snowstorm days. He watched snowflakes on his mittens, on the dried grass of Vermont farm fields, on the dark metal handle of the barn door. He said snow was as beautiful as butterflies, or apple blossoms.\
 \
 (paragraph 2) He could net butterflies and show them to his older brother, Charlie. He could pick apple blossoms and take them to his mother. But he could not share snowflakes because he could not save them.\
 \
 (paragraph 3) When his mother gave him an old microscope, he used it to look at flowers, raindrops, and blades of grass. Best of all, he used it to look at snow. While other children built forts and pelted snowballs at roosting crows, Willie was catching snowflakes. Day after stormy day he studied the icy crystals.\
 \
 (paragraph 4) Their intricate patterns were even more beautiful than he had imagined. He expected to find whole flakes that were the same, that were copies of each other. But he never did. Willie decided he must find a way to save snowflakes so others could see their wonderful designs. For three winters he tried drawing snow crystals. They always melted before he could finish.\
 \
 (paragraph 5) When he was sixteen, Willie read of a camera with its own microscope. “If I had that camera I could photograph snowflakes,” he told his mother. Willie’s mother knew that he would not be happy until he could share what he had seen.\
 \
 (paragraph6) “Fussing with snow is just foolishness,” his father said. Still, he loved his son. When Willie was seventeen his parents spent their savings and bought the camera. It was taller than a newborn calf, and cost as much as his father’s herd of ten cows. Willie was sure it was the best of all cameras.\
 \
 (paragraph 7) Even so his first pictures were failures—no better than shadows. Yet he would not quit. Mistake by mistake, snowflake by snowflake, Willie worked through every storm. Winter ended, the snow melted, and he had no good pictures. He waited for another season of snow. One day, in the second winter, he tried a new experiment. And it\
 worked! Willie had figured out how to photograph snowflakes! “Now everyone can see the great beauty in a tiny crystal,” he said.\
 \
 (paragraph 8) But in those days, no one cared. Neighbors laughed at the idea of photographing snow. “Snow in Vermont is as common as dirt,” they said. “We don’t need pictures.” Willie said the photographs would be his gift to the world. While other farmers sat by the fire or rode to town with horse and sleigh, Willie studied snowstorms. He stood at the shed door and held out a black tray to catch the flakes.\
 \
 (paragraph 9) When he found only jumbled, broken crystals, he brushed the tray clean with a turkey feather and held it out again. He waited hours for just the right crystal and didn’t notice the cold. If the shed were warm the snow would melt. If he breathed on the black tray the snow would melt. If he twitched a muscle as he held the snow crystal on the long wood pick the snowflake would break. He had to work fast or the snowflake would evaporate before he could slide it into place and take its picture. Some winters he was able to make only a few dozen good pictures. Some winters he made hundreds. . . .\
 \
 (paragraph 10) But his snow crystal pictures were always his favorites. He gave copies away or sold them for a few cents. He made special pictures as gifts for birthdays. He held evening slide shows on the lawns of his friends. Children and adults sat on the grass and watched while Willie projected his slides onto a sheet hung over a clothesline.\
 \
 (paragraph 11) He wrote about snow and published his pictures in magazines. He gave speeches about snow to faraway scholars and neighborhood skywatchers. “You are doing great work,” said a professor from Wisconsin. The little farmer came to be known as the world’s expert on snow, “the Snowflake Man.” But he never grew rich. He spent every\
 penny on his pictures. Willie said there were treasures in snow. “I can’t afford to miss a single snowstorm,” he told a friend. “I never know when I will find some wonderful prize.”\

 View with a Grain of Sand\
 \
 We call it a grain of sand\
 but it calls itself neither grain nor sand.\
 It does just fine without a name,\
 whether general, particular,\
 (line 5) permanent, passing,\
 incorrect or apt.\
 \
 Our glance, our touch mean nothing to it.\
 It doesn’t feel itself seen and touched.\
 And that it fell on the windowsill\
 (line 10) is only our experience, not its.\
 For it it’s no different than falling on anything else\
 with no assurance that it’s finished falling\
 or that it’s falling still.\
 \
 The window has a wonderful view of a lake\
 (line 15) but the view doesn’t view itself.\
 It exists in this world\
 colorless, shapeless,\
 soundless, odorless, and painless.\
 \
 The lake’s floor exists floorlessly\
 (line 20) and its shore exists shorelessly.\
 Its water feels itself neither wet nor dry\
 and its waves to themselves are neither singular nor plural.\
 They splash deaf to their own noise\
 on pebbles neither large nor small.\
 \
 (line 25) And all this beneath a sky by nature skyless\
 in which the sun sets without setting at all\
 and hides without hiding behind an unminding cloud.\
 The wind ruffles it, its only reason being\
 that it blows.\
 \
 (line 30) A second passes.\
 A second second.\
 A third.\
 But they’re three seconds only for us.\
 \
 Time has passed like a courier with urgent news.\
 (line 35) But that’s just our simile.\
 The character’s invented, his haste is make-believe,\
 his news inhuman.\

Reading Comprehension Passage C\
 \
 …Nowhere is light pollution more apparent, almost achingly so, than in satellite images\
 of the Earth from space. The continental United States seems to split in half: the eastern\
 side is brighter than the west, except for the klieg lights of Las Vegas. Highways innervate (innervate - energize)\
 America, connecting luminous dots of small towns and big cities. Across the Atlantic,\
 (line 5) Europe shimmers. Moscow is a radiant nine-pointed star. The Nile Delta glows like a\
 dandelion sprouting from mostly indigo Africa. Farther east, Hong Kong and Shanghai are\
 ablaze, and the demilitarised zone separates dark North Korea from South Korea more\
 cleanly than if the peninsula had been cleft in two. Developed society, it’s clear, is where the\
 light is.\
 \
 (line 10) Human-controlled light has pierced the night for thousands of years, long before\
 [Thomas] Edison. Campfires warmed our ancestors’ feet and cooked their meals; the\
 Harvard anthropologist Richard Wrangham argues in his book Catching Fire (2009) that\
 gathering around a flame to eat and to commune with others is, in fact, what made us\
 human. Not just fellowship but safety has long been the primary rationale for pushing back\
 (line 15) the night. ‘Evil spirits love not the smell of lamps,’ as Plato put it. Comforting, lambent (lambent — glowing or flickering with a soft radiance) \
 lamplight led us safely home by tattling on the people and potholes and animals that would\
 otherwise do us harm. By the early 17th century, residents of cities such as Paris and London\
 were admonished (admonished — warned) to keep lights burning in the windows of all houses that faced the streets,\
 as the historian A. Roger Ekirch notes in his book At Day’s Close: Night in Times Past\
 (line 20) (2005). Taxpayers funded oil lamps and candlelit lanterns for the avenues, while only\
 genteel households could afford fine beeswax or spermaceti candles; most people relied on\
 tallow, made from animal fat. …\
 \
 And even so — what price safety! A young but rapidly growing field of research suggests\
 that night-time light itself is far more dangerous than the dark. In a 2012 report, an\
 (line 25) American Medical Association committee called electric lighting a ‘man-made self-\
 experiment’ creating potentially harmful health effects. Humans, and everything else that\
 lives on this planet with us, evolved during billions of years along a reliable cycle of day and\
 night, with clear boundaries between them. Staunching the flood of artificial light can help\
 restore this divide. Our well-being, and that of our fellow creatures, might depend on us\
 (line 30) doing so — or at the very least trying. The loss of night-time darkness neglects our shared\
 past, but it might very well cut short our futures too. …\
 \
 A growing body of evidence shows that light pollution exacerbates (exacerbates — makes a situation worse),  and might directly\
 cause, cancer, obesity, and depression, the troublesome triumvirate (triumvirate — a group of three holding power) of industrialised\
 society. One of the first people to notice this correlation, at least as it applies to cancer, is\
 (line 35) Richard Stevens, a professor at the University of Connecticut, respected cancer\
 epidemiologist (epidemiologist — health professional who investigates patterns and causes of diseases), and mild insomniac. In the early 1980s, Stevens and other researchers\
 were beginning to realise there was little or no connection between diet and rising rates \
 breast cancer, contrary to what had been suspected. As Stevens puts it, it was like a light\
 bulb going on when he realised that, in fact, a light bulb going on might be a culprit. …\
 \
 (line 40) ‘Rather than falling, night, to the watchful eye, rises,’ writes Ekirch in At Day’s Close.\
 Shadows creep up lows and valleys first, then consume hillsides and houses and the tallest\
 buildings. Muted greys and deeper blues chase off the sun until finally the sky leaks no\
 colour. When we sleep according to a solar cycle, melatonin (melantonin - hormone that regulates sleep and wakefulness) production follows this\
 pattern, rising with the night. But artificial light tamps it down. This is frustratingly\
 (line 45) apparent for a special class of humans who experience sunsets every 90 minutes: astronauts.\
 \
 One of the most frequent complaints of orbital crew members is insomnia; they pop\
 sleeping pills on a regular basis, and still get only about six hours of shuteye, though they’re\
 allotted eight. Steven W. Lockley, a Harvard neuroscientist, recommends altering the light\
 to improve matters. In 2012, he advised NASA [National Aeronautics and Space\
 (line 50) Administration] engineers to change the light bulbs on the International Space Station to a\
 type of LED that can display blue-shifted light during the ‘day’, when the crew is working,\
 and red-shifted light when they need to rest. Why the difference? That crucial ganglion (ganglion — mass of nerve tissues in the brain),\
 the circadian (circadian — 24-hour biological cycle) photoreceptor, is particularly sensitive to light toward the bluish end of the\
 red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo and violet visible-light spectrum. …\
 \
 (line 55) Insomnia is hardly the worst side effect of light pollution. Shift workers, who rise with\
 the night and work awash in blue light, experience not only disrupted circadian rhythms and\
 sleep deprivation, but an increased risk of breast and prostate cancer. These cancers, which\
 require hormones to grow, are suppressed in the presence of melatonin, Stevens has shown.\
 In 2010, Stevens published a review of breast cancer sensitivity in 164 countries, and found\
 (line 60) a 30 to 50 per cent increased risk of cancer in nations with the worst light pollution, but no\
 increased prevalence of non-hormonally dependent cancers in the same populations.\
 \
 ‘Our use of electric light in the modern world is disrupting our circadian sleep and our\
 biology. There is no question about that. Does that have physiological consequences? There\
 is more and more evidence that it does,’ Stevens told me. ‘The epidemiological studies are\
 (line 65) the crudest, but the most important.’ …\
 \
 When we, in the industrialised world, do manage to turn off the lights, there are\
 measurable, beneficial effects on our circadian rhythms. In a widely reported paper last\
 summer, Kenneth Wright at the University of Colorado at Boulder took eight students\
 camping in the Rocky Mountains for two weeks. They weren’t allowed to use any artificial\
 (line 70) light after the sun went down — only the sanguine (sanguine — red) glow of campfire. After a week,\
 melatonin started to rise at sunset, peak in the middle of the night, and taper just at sunrise,\
 which Wright called a ‘remarkable’ result. ‘Internal biological time under natural light-dark\
 conditions tightly synchronises to environmental time, and in this regard, humans are\
 comparable to other animals,’ he wrote. …\
 \
 (line 75) For those of us addicted to our glowing phones and tablets, an app called F.lux can help.\
 It ‘warms’ your device’s display screen so that it shifts red in the evening, more closely\
 matching incandescent bulbs and the hue of the setting sun. Just a brief glimpse at your\
 mobile phone at bedtime is enough to expose your retinas to artificial light, so fighting such\
 a comprehensive intrusion might be an exercise in futility. But even if we can’t completely\
 (line 80) quench our thirst for light, we can all make one small gesture, which could prompt us to\
 unplug a little more. …\

Excerpt from A la Carte\
 by Tanita S. Davis\
 \
 (paragraph 1) “Homework?” My mother mouths the word exaggeratedly, eyebrows raised, and I\
 roll my eyes. Frowning, she points with her chin to the side door that leads to the stairs.\
 I roll my eyes again, mouthing, Okay, okay, not needing her to pantomime further what\
 she wants me to do. I hate the thought of leaving the clattering nerve center of the\
 restaurant to wrestle with my trigonometry homework in my mother’s quiet office\
 downstairs.\
 (paragraph 2) \"Order!\"\
 (paragraph 3) The bright lights and swirl of noise and motion are muffled as the kitchen door\
 swings closed behind me.\
 (paragraph 4) It’s hard to remember a time when the restaurant hasn’t been the center of our lives.\
 Mom used to be a copy editor and wrote food features for our local paper, the Clarion,\
 and she met Pia when she did a write-up on the culinary school Pia attended. Pia\
 thinks it was fate that Mom wanted to invest in a restaurant at the same time Pia\
 wanted to buy the old bank building.\
 (paragraph 5) La Salle Rouge doesn’t serve much in the way of “kid” food, since the menu doesn’t\
 cater to people my age on a cheap date, but I’ve loved everything about it from the first.\
 I started experimenting with being a vegetarian when I turned fourteen, but Pia still\
 found things to feed me and taught me to be creative with vegetables and tofu. I like to\
 think I’m the best-fed vegetarian in the state of California.\
 (paragraph 6) Pia’s been really good about teaching what she knows, and I decided early on that\
 this is the work I want to do—get out of school and get into the kitchen for good. Mom\
 and Pia have created a popular French-Asian-Californian fusion restaurant that has\
 gotten great reviews from food critics. They took the best of each other’s tastes—\
 Mom’s traditional Southern flavors and Pia’s French training combined with her\
 vegetable- and spice-savvy Cambodian tastes—and pulled off what one food critic\
 called “stylized food with unique flavor combinations in an intimate setting.”\
 (paragraph 7) Whatever that means.\
 (paragraph 8) Three years ago, when I started high school thirty pounds heavier than everyone in\
 my class, Mom and I came up with a light menu for La Salle Rouge, and it’s been such a\
 popular idea that Mom lets me come up with tasty, low-calorie desserts, which is one of\
 my favorite things to do. It hardly seems fair that I have to walk away from all of that\
 just to do trigonometry, but my mom says I have to finish school before I concentrate\
 on cooking. She says it’s smarter to have a “backup plan,” and she’s made me apply to\
 plenty of colleges and check out business majors just in case I ever want to do anything\
 else with my life. I guess that makes sense if you’re anybody other than me. When I\
 turn eighteen, I already know what I’m going to do.\
 (paragraph 9) First, I’m going to buy a plane ticket to D.C. and go to Julia Child’s kitchen at the\
 Smithsonian and leave roses. They don’t let you walk through it, but somewhere—I\
 don’t know where—I’m going to leave a bouquet and a little note for her. Julia Child is\
 my patron saint (patron saint: an inspiring person admired for his or her work). She’s the queen of all reasons people can do anything they want in\
 life. Saint Julia didn’t start cooking until she was practically forty, and she went on to\
 do TV shows and make cookbooks and be this huge part of culinary history. She never\
 got too fancy, she never freaked out, and she was never afraid to try new things. I want\
 to be just like her—except maybe get famous faster.\
 (paragraph 10) The second thing I’m going to do is buy myself a set of knives. Pia swears by this set\
 of German steel knives she got when she graduated, but I’ve seen the TV chef Kylie\
 Kwong use a phenomenal-looking ceramic knife on her show on the Discovery\
 Channel. Either way, knives are what the best chefs have of their very own.\
 (paragraph 11) The third thing I’m going to do, after I get back from Washington and get my knives,\
 is . . . get discovered. Somehow. I know I’m going to have to pay my dues, but I’m so\
 ready for my real life to start. It’s not something I admit to a lot, but my real dream is to\
 be a celebrity chef. Do you know how many African American female chefs there\
 aren’t? And how many vegetarian chefs have their own shows? The field is wide open\
 for stardom. Every time I watch old episodes of Saint Julia, I imagine that I have my\
 own cooking show. The way celebrity chefs do it now, I could also have a line of\
 cooking gear, cookbooks, aprons, the works. People would know my name, ask for my\
 autograph, and try my recipes. All I have to do is finish my trig homework and get back\
 into the kitchen.\
In paragraph 11, what does the one-word statement “Somehow” reveal?\
(A) It illustrates the narrator’s enthusiasm about her future plans.\
 (B) It shows the narrator has some questions about whether she will succeed or not.\
 (C) It shows the narrator does not have every detail of her future plans figured out just yet.\
 (D) It demonstrates the narrator’s lack of knowledge about how difficult her goals are to achieve.\

This excerpt is from a book about the history of the Hudson River.\
 \
 Excerpt from River of Dreams\
 by Hudson Talbott\
 \
 (paragraph 1) By the twentieth century, New York City had long since reached its destiny of\
 becoming the most powerful city in America. In less than 300 years it had grown from\
 a tiny Dutch outpost in the wilderness to the business capital of the world. It was a city\
 built on dreams.\
 (paragraph 2) But it was made out of bricks and cement that had come from the banks of the\
 Hudson. The river which had fed all those dreams was now fading into the background.\
 New York didn’t seem to need the river anymore, except as a sewer. And that’s what it\
 became.\
 (paragraph 3) Industry on the river had made some New Yorkers filthy rich. But it had just made\
 the river filthy. Garbage, factory waste, plant chemicals and the raw sewage of the cities\
 and towns along its banks were dumped directly into the river. The water turned\
 greenish brown, except by the GM plant, where it turned red or yellow or whatever\
 color they were painting the cars that day.\
 (paragraph 4) The fishing industry collapsed. The few fish that survived were too poisonous to eat.\
 Smog from the factory smoke and dust from the cement plants blanketed the valley.\
 And it was all legal.\
 (paragraph 5) Most people don’t start out with dreams of polluting a river. But it was often the\
 result of people chasing their dreams of wealth with little care of how they reached it.\
 The Hudson Valley had always drawn them.\
 (paragraph 6) But now there were other dreamers in the valley, with their own dreams of wealth.\
 They dreamed of the wealth of wildlife in a healthy forest, the abundance of fish in\
 oxygen-rich water, and the great fortune of living in a beautiful river valley.\
 (paragraph 7) So perhaps it was a matter of time before the two types of dreamers would meet each\
 other—in court.\
 (paragraph 8) In 1963, Con Edison, New York City’s power company, proposed a plan for\
 constructing the largest hydroelectric pumping station ever built. The plan called for\
 carving out a gigantic hole in the side of majestic Storm King Mountain on the Hudson\
 River.\
 (paragraph 9) But then they met Franny Reese. Franny was a longtime valley resident with a simple\
 point to make: the mountain could not speak for itself. If she didn’t speak for it, who\
 would?\
 (paragraph 10) Franny and a group of like-minded people founded Scenic Hudson and took on the\
 power company in a landmark court case. Con Ed challenged the right of private\
 citizens to participate, but the court sided with the citizens, in the ruling now known as\
 the Scenic Hudson Decision.\
 (paragraph 11) After dragging out the case for seventeen years, Con Ed finally gave up and Storm\
 King survived unblemished. It was the beginning of the environmental movement in\
 this country, and once again, the Hudson Valley was the birthplace.\
 (paragraph 12) More and more people joined the movement as they realized how much difference\
 each of us can make.\
 (paragraph 13) The love of their land was still alive in the hearts of Americans, and now that it was\
 aroused again, things began to change.\
 (paragraph 14) Many new laws and new citizens’ groups have been inspired by those early heroes of\
 the environment, and their work has begun to bring the Hudson back to life.\
 (paragraph 15) The Mahicans called it “The River That Flows Both Ways.” Slowly we are learning\
 that taking care of the river is the only way that the river can take care of us.\
 (paragraph 16) Fifty years have passed since I dreamed of going to New York to see the river that\
 shares my name, and thirty-five years since that dream came true. I live in the Hudson\
 Valley now, grateful to all those who came before me, following their dreams to this\
 river, building this nation, sharing its beauty, securing its future.\
 (paragraph 17) It’s now my turn to help in keeping the river of dreams flowing, for all those\
 dreamers yet to come.\
How does the idea expressed in paragraph 15 relate to the article?\
(A) There are two main ways that the river can be fixed.\
 (B) The river is able to move in two different directions.\
 (C) People who benefit from the river must also protect it.\
 (D) Opposing groups can each get what they want from the river.\

Base your answers to questions 1 and 2 on the passage below and on your knowledge of social studies.\
 \
    The sankin kōtai (lit., “alternate attendance”) system was a device of the Tokugawa shogunate, the government of Japan from 1603 to 1868, designed to insure political control by the regime over the daimyo, or territorial lords, who exercised virtually autonomous authority over the more than 260 feudal states into which four-fifths of the country was divided. Under this system most of the daimyo were required to travel biennially [every two years] from their domains to the capital of the Tokugawa at Edo (present day Tokyo) and to spend alternate years in personal attendance at the shogunal court. Each daimyo was also required to maintain residences at the capital where his wife and children were permanently detained. . . .\
    Another important contribution of the operation of the sankin kōtai system to the modernization of Japan was to promote the intellectual and cultural unification of the country. The sankin kōtai served to bring a large part of the leadership elements from the whole country together in one place and to keep a constant stream of leaders and intellectuals moving back and forth between the capital and all parts of the country. This was important in giving Japan the tremendous intellectual unity with which it faced the West in the nineteenth century. It also enabled the people at large to have a stronger sense of national unity than would have been the case had the system not existed. By serving as the vehicle which spread the culture of Edo and Osaka to the countryside, the system influenced the diffusion of a truly national culture. . . .\

Excerpt from The Call of Coney Island\
 \
 by Cynthia Overbeck Bix\
 \
 (paragraph 1) Salty ocean smells mingle with the aromas of sweet cotton candy and Nathan’s Famous hot dogs. The legendary Cyclone roller coaster lurches along its tracks—then takes a heart-stopping plunge. Riders whoop and scream with excitement. Farther down the boardwalk, the sound of a carousel starts. Patrons pitch balls at moving targets, hoping to win a prize. Welcome to Coney Island, the nation’s first truly modern amusement area.\
 \
 (paragraph 2) Located on the southern tip of Brooklyn, New York, Coney Island has been the place to go for fun for more than a century. The inspiration for amusement parks such as Coney Island sprang from an exciting event in 1893—the World’s Columbian Exposition in Chicago. It was one of the first venues where people experienced a variety of attractions in one large space. \
 \
 (paragraph 3) Visitors to Chicago gasped in wonder when they saw the fair’s “White City” spread out before them. Beautiful all-white exhibition buildings and large classical statues framed a lagoon of shimmering water. Designed to educate and inform, about a dozen grand buildings housed displays on the latest developments in transportation, machinery, agriculture, art, horticulture, and more. Most visitors had never seen the things they saw there, such as electric lights, a moving sidewalk, world-famous artwork, and moving pictures.\
 \
 (paragraph 4) While the World’s Columbian Exposition awed people with new innovations and ideas, its most popular attraction was the Midway Plaisance. Located in a separate section of the exhibition grounds, the Midway was filled with entertainment: rides, food stands, and sideshows. People could get a taste of international cultures, for example, by riding a camel through the Streets of Cairo or strolling among the thatched huts of a South Sea village. Best of all, they could ride George Ferris’s giant spinning wheel. Rising 264 feet above the Midway, this engineering marvel became the star of the fair. It was a spectacular example of what the new age of machines made possible.\
 \
 (paragraph 5) One visitor, New York showman George C. Tilyou, immediately saw potential for this new form of entertainment. Tilyou owned property on Coney Island, which already was an established beach resort with hotels, bathhouses, and restaurants. It also featured an odd collection of sideshows, food vendors, fortunetellers, and more. Tilyou decided to build an enclosed amusement park there.\
 \
 (paragraph 6) In 1897, Tilyou opened Steeplechase Park. When he was unable to buy Ferris’s wheel, he had his own version built. For 25 cents, visitors could ride Tilyou’s wheel, enjoy the Scenic Railway, or climb into a “spaceship” for a Trip to the Moon. On the Steeplechase, wooden horses carried riders along a metal racetrack from a starting gate to a finish line.\
 \
 (paragraph 7) Steeplechase Park’s huge success was partly due to another invention—electric railways. The first electric trolley line had connected Manhattan Island and Coney Island in the mid-1800s. By the turn of the 20th century, an electric train offered an even faster way to carry more people wanting to escape from the hot, crowded city.\
 \
 (paragraph 8) In the late 1800s and early 1900s, most people worked long hours and six days a week in urban factories and shops. But for a nickel fare, a city worker could afford a day’s outing to a nearby park on Sundays. Recognizing the value of giving the working class access to day trips, trolley and train companies established parks that were located at the end of a line. Travelers disembarked to enjoy simple outdoor pleasures in picnic groves and swimming pools or beaches. Eventually, merry-go-rounds, penny arcades, (penny arcades - indoor area with amusements such as games and photo booths operated by placing a coin in a slot) and even small roller coasters were added. . . .\
 \
 (paragraph 9) Part sideshow, part circus, part theme park, Coney Island set an example for amusement parks. Attractions that are so familiar today—roller coasters, water rides, fun houses, Tunnels of Love—all got their start there.\
 \
 (paragraph 10) Many amusement parks closed during the Great Depression in the 1930s or during World War II (1939–1945). Coney Island has had its ups and downs, too. Over the decades, fires and age destroyed some of the original attractions. In 2012, Superstorm Sandy wrecked the boardwalk and many of the attractions.\
 \
 (paragraph 11) In spite of all that, Coney Island has survived, and it is still operating today. It continues to offer each new generation of kids (and their parents) a chance to escape to a special world of entertainment and thrills. And from New Jersey’s Wildwood Park to California’s Pacific Park and Florida’s Walt Disney World, other amusement and theme parks have taken their cues from Coney Island. They have grown to epic proportions in their efforts to offer a world full of fun.\
The use of quotation marks around the word \"spaceship\" in paragraph 6 suggests that\
(A) the spaceship is a form of transportation for the ride\
 (B) the vehicle that the visitors ride looks like a spaceship\
 (C) the park has an old spaceship converted into a ride\
 (D) the spaceship resembles a similar attraction at another park\

 \
 In this interview Deng Xiaoping discusses changes to the Chinese economy.\
 \
 “There is no fundamental contradiction between socialism and a market economy. The problem is how to develop the productive forces more effectively. We used to have a planned economy, but our experience over the years has proved that having a totally planned economy hampers the development of the productive forces to a certain extent. If we combine a planned economy with a market economy, we shall be in a better position to liberate the productive forces and speed up economic growth.”…\

Reading Comprehension Passage A\
 \
 Screeno\
 In the following passage, Cornelius Schmidt seeks refuge from a gloomy, rainy night by going to a movie. \
 \
 …At the door [of the theater] the uniformed ticket taker gave him a card on which was \
 printed a kind of checkerboard, having in each box a number. It was obviously the old game \
 of Lotto, the object being to get five numbers which were successive either horizontally or\
 vertically or in a diagonal. In the center, amid numbered boxes, was a box entitled\
 (line 5) GRATIS; (GRATIS - free, a space that could count as any number called) the management gave this box to the audience. …\
    The theatre fell into a semi-darkness, not the movie darkness, but one in which discreet\
 lights shone on both sides of the theatre and both sides of the stage. A white and pink\
 clockface flashed on the screen. It was, in fact, like a roulette wheel, and had numbers\
 running from 1 to 100. In the center was a pointer, which suddenly began to whirl furiously \
 (line 10) about the clockface, and then slowed down, and then stopped.\
    \"Ninety-nine!\" said the businesslike yet airy young man in an authoritative voice.\
 An usher wrote down the number upon a blackboard to the right of the screen. The pointer \
 spun again, at a tremendous pace, so that it was almost a moving blur for a moment, and\
 then clarified into its arrow-like straightness. The actual wheel was, of course, in the\
 (line 15) projection room.\
    \"Fifty-four!\" said the young master of ceremonies, simulating a dramatic tone.\
    \"SCREENO!\" cried a voice from the balcony in a mocking voice, while everyone\
 laughed, for obviously no one could have SCREENO as yet.\
    \"I am sorry, ladies and gentlemen,\" said the young man in an affable (affable - friendly) voice,\" but we will \
 (line 20) have to ask you not to be humorous about this. After all, money is involved, and there has\
 been much confusion in the past because various people insisted upon trying to be\
 funny.\"…\
    The pointer was revolving again. \"Thirty-nine!\" announced the young man. The\
 audience was not yet warmed up, because too few numbers had been called for anyone to \
 (line 25) be on the verge of winning. Cornelius, however, also had this third number and was pleased \
 no little by the course of events.\
    \"Forty-nine!\" announced the young man. …\
    \"Fourteen!\" cried the young man into the microphone which made his voice even more\
 official than otherwise. Cornelius did not have the number. He assured himself that the\
 (line 30) game was a fraud, that the management was obviously not going to permit anyone to win so \
 much money and that the whole business would obviously be controlled in the projection \
 room or by arranging the numbers on the cards. There was only one more chance, a drop\
 in the ocean. He slouched back in his seat, chiding himself for his great excitement. …\
    \"Twenty-five!\" the master of ceremonies called out.\
 (line 35)    \"Twenty-five! Twenty-five!\" said Cornelius to himself, and then, finding the number on\
 his card as the fifth consecutive horizontal number, he rose in his seat and shouted:\
    \"SCREENO!\" in a too loud voice which broke, and began to issue (to issue - to exit) from his aisle,\
 tripping over the feet of the people seated near him, some of whom were solicitous (solicitous - helpful) of his\
 walk, and eager to provide good advice as he passed. The attractiveness of the winner shone\
 (line 40) in him. …\
    An usher took his card, and checked it with the numbers on the blackboard. The young\
 man came over to oversee the usher. It seemed as if something was wrong, someone\
 had miscalculated, to look at the young man. The checking was done several times.\
 Very bureaucratic, said Cornelius to himself. Recovering, as the checkup proved that\
 (line 45) Cornelius had indeed won, he shook Cornelius’s hand and the whole theatre lighted up.\
    \"Lucky fellow,\" cried the balcony voice, amusing the audience again, by the envious\
 tone in his voice. …\
    The usher arrived with the money just as the persistent balcony voice called out,\
 \"Let’s go on with the show,\" and the audience began to clap again, wishing to have its\
 (line 50) chance at the other prizes.\
    But then, as the money was delivered to the young assistant manager, and he began\
 officiously to count it out, shuffle it, and arrange it, before paying Cornelius, a hoarse and \
 disused voice cried from the balcony:\
    \"SCREENO! SCREENO!\" …\
 (line 55)   \"SCREENO!\" came the voice again, this time nearer, as the new winner approached\
 the stairs from the balcony to the orchestra. The young assistant manager and the ushers \
 looked at each other in dismay. Something had obviously gone wrong, for usually no one\
 won the jackpot; two winners was inconceivable and would lead to bankruptcy. Someone\
 was going to lose his job because of this. …\
 (line 60)   \"My name is Casper Weingarten,\" said the old man, unasked, intruding himself upon\
 the huddle of the assistant manager and the ushers. He was very nervous, very excited.\
 \"I am a musician,\" he said, but no one paid any attention to him, except Cornelius.\
    And then the young assistant manager came over to the old man and, holding the card\
 up, showed him that he had not won, that he had mistaken a 7 for a 1 because the print had\
 (line 65) been on the left-hand side. \"Perhaps you’ll win one of the other prizes,\" he said,\
 courteously, \"since you already have four numbers in a row.\" …\
    Cornelius came over to look into the matter for himself. He took the card in his hand\
 and looked at the number in question. The old man looked at him, and then turned to the\
 assistant manager, saying:\
 (line 70)   \"Give me my money! I have won!\" …\
    \"Look here,\" said Cornelius tactfully to the assistant manager, \"it seems to me that you\
 can only assume that this is a 1. The blur is too faint to make it a seven.\"\
    \"I know it is a 7,\" said the assistant manager angrily, and when he said that, Cornelius\
 recognized immediately that he was so sure because the cards had been prepared in\
 (line 75) advance to obviate the possibility of two winners of the jackpot, or even one. Seeing this,\
 Cornelius began to feel sick and angry, as he always did when confronted with fraud or\
 cheating.\
    \"All my life I’ve been cheated,\" said the old man, wringing his hands. \"Give me my\
 money.\" An usher took his arm, as if to lead him from the stage, but the assistant manager\
 (line 80) deterred him, unwilling as yet to resort to force. …\
    \"My good man,\" said the assistant manager, \"Your hard luck is not my fault, nor this\
 theatre’s responsibility. Please do not cause a disturbance. Now if both of you will leave the\
 stage, we can go on with the other prizes and with the show.\"\
    In answer, the old man sat down upon the stage, looking grotesque there, with his head\
 (line 85) turned up. \"I will sit here until I am paid,\" he said tearfully. …\
    But the audience was won over, for no one wished to lose his chance at the remaining\
 $50. There was a murmuring of voices and someone cried out:\
    \"Go home and give us a chance.\" …\
    \"Call a cop,\" said another. …\
 (line 90)   Cornelius meditated with himself for a moment and then said: \"Listen, I will give you\
 half of the jackpot. Come on before you’re arrested.\" …\
    \"No,\" said Weingarten, \"I don’t want your money. I want mine. Give me my money,\"\
 he said towards the assistant manager.\
    Cornelius considered matters with himself again and came to a decision. Easy come,\
 (line 95) easy go, he said to himself, and then he told the old musician that he could have the whole\
 jackpot. The manager protested immediately, but Cornelius took the bills from his pocket\
 and began to count them out and give them to the musician, who accepted them with\
 a guilty look and trembling hands.\
    The audience saw what was happening and applauded vigorously, not because it was\
 (line 100) genuinely moved, but because it felt that it ought to applaud. Such applause is heard at\
 public gatherings when an abstraction too vacuous (vacuous - insincere) is mentioned or tribute is paid to a man\
 long dead. The assistant manager, trying to move in on Cornelius’s credit, came over to\
 shake hands with Cornelius. Cornelius, tempted to reject the proffered hand, accepted it\
 because he wished to cause no further disturbance.\
 (line 105)   The old man had risen and come over to Cornelius.\
    \"Thank you very much for your kindness,\" he said in the estranged voice of those who\
 have been weeping or overexcited.\
    \"Not at all,\" said Cornelius formally. Both descended from the stage together. …\

Reading Comprehension Passage B\
 \
 Ithaka (Ithaka - In the epic, The Odyssey, it took Odysseus 10 years to return to his Greek island home of Ithaka after\
 winning the Trojan war)\
 \
 As you set out for Ithaka\
 hope the voyage is a long one,\
 full of adventure, full of discovery.\
 Laistrygonians and Cyclops, (Laistrygonians and Cyclops - monsters that Odysseus encountered on his journey home)\
 (line 5) angry Poseidon (Poseidon - the Greek god of the sea who sought to punish Odysseus for harming his son, a Cyclops)—don’t be afraid of them:\
 you’ll never find things like that on your way\
 as long as you keep your thoughts raised high,\
 as long as a rare excitement\
 stirs your spirit and your body.\
 (line 10) Laistrygonians and Cyclops,\
 wild Poseidon—you won’t encounter them\
 unless you bring them along inside your soul,\
 unless your soul sets them up in front of you.\
 \
 Hope the voyage is a long one.\
 (line 15) May there be many a summer morning when,\
 with what pleasure, what joy,\
 you come into harbors seen for the first time;\
 may you stop at Phoenician trading stations\
 to buy fine things,\
 (line 20) mother of pearl and coral, amber and ebony,\
 sensual perfume of every kind—\
 as many sensual perfumes as you can;\
 and may you visit many Egyptian cities\
 to gather stores of knowledge from their scholars.\
 \
 (line 25) Keep Ithaka always in your mind.\
 Arriving there is what you are destined for.\
 But do not hurry the journey at all.\
 Better if it lasts for years,\
 so you are old by the time you reach the island,\
 (line 30) wealthy with all you have gained on the way,\
 not expecting Ithaka to make you rich.\
 \
 Ithaka gave you the marvelous journey.\
 Without her you would not have set out.\
 She has nothing left to give you now.\
 (line 35) And if you find her poor, Ithaka won’t have fooled you.\
 Wise as you will have become, so full of experience,\
 you will have understood by then what these Ithakas mean.\
 \
 —C.P. Cavafy\
 “Ithaka”\
 from C.P. Cavafy: Collected Poems, 1992\
 translated by Edmund Keeley and Philip Sherrard\

 (2) there was a large amount of variation in their population, and the environment changed frequently\
 (3) they could move between different environments when food supplies became scarce\

 Excerpt from Waste Not, Want Not\
 by Teresa Bateman\
 \
 (paragraph 1) My mother believed in using things up. We always squeezed the toothpaste tube until it was as sharp as a razor, and we cleaned our plates, even when it was liver-andonions\
 night. . . .\
 \
 (paragraph 2) Mom’s frugality was legendary. She could make one chicken come back in a dozen meals as variously disguised leftovers. Her favorite saying was “waste not, want not.” Josh and I weren’t sure what that meant, but it probably explained why Mom was into recycling long before it became popular. It also explained why the “Affair of the Hat,” as it later became known, was so strange.\
 \
 (paragraph 3) The Hat deserved capital letters. It was about three feet across, made of green straw and covered with big plastic daisies, two red peonies, and an orange bow. I might have said it was “dog ugly,” except that wouldn’t sit well with our dog, Mutt.\
 \
 (paragraph 4) Great-aunt Marjorie had given The Hat to Mother on one of her visits to our farm. It was supposed to keep the sun off Mother’s delicate complexion while enhancing her rural beauty (whatever that meant). . . .\
 \
 (paragraph 5) When Aunt Marjorie returned to the city, Josh and I held our breath to see what would happen to The Hat. We could see that Mom’s thrifty nature and fashion sense were in pitched battle. She couldn’t justify throwing The Hat away—it was nearly new and had a lot of use left in it—but neither could she stomach wearing it. She tried pulling off the daisies and peonies, but they were stuck on tight, as were the perky orange ribbons that held The Hat in place. She’d have to find some other solution.\
 \
 (paragraph 6) One day Josh and I came down to breakfast and noticed that The Hat was missing from the hook by the door. We looked at each other, then scouted the house. It wasn’t hard to spot. Mother had installed it in the parlor as a lampshade.\
 \
 (paragraph 7) Our parakeet, Pete, chirped inquiringly from his cage as Josh and I decided to see how The Hat looked in full lampshade glory. We pulled the chain.\
 \
 (paragraph 8 ) Pete tweeted once, then dropped like a stone from his perch. We ran to his cage, and Josh suggested mouth-to-beak resuscitation. Then we glanced over at the lamp. The light shining through the peonies made them look like two big red eyes glaring at you. No wonder Pete had fainted. We plucked The Hat from the lamp and went to tell Mom. Reluctantly she hung it back up on the hook by the door. . . .\
 \
 (paragraph 9) The next morning she headed out the door, The Hat filled to the brim with turkey feed. Josh and I watched as Mother approached the turkeys scavenging in the barnyard. The minute those turkeys sighted The Hat, they ran gobbling toward the barn door and dived in a panic into the haystack. Mom dumped the turkey feed in the barnyard and\
 walked back to the house, her shoulders drooping. . . .\
 \
 (paragraph 10) She threw The Hat to the floor, raised her foot, and screamed, “THIS HAT IS FOR THE BIRDS!” Josh and I stepped back, waiting for her foot to come crashing down.\
 \
 (paragraph 11) “It is not for the birds,” Josh blurted. \"They hate it!”\
 \
 (paragraph 12) It was as though time stood still. Then we heard a strange sound. Mother was laughing!\
 \
 (paragraph 13) We shook our heads. She’d finally gone over the edge—there she stood, one foot in the air, laughing like a hysterical flamingo.\
 \
 (paragraph 14) Then she put her foot down . . . on the floor. She picked up The Hat and headed upstairs where we heard boxes being shuffled around in the attic. . .\
 \
 (paragraph 15) When she came down, she was dragging a body. It was wearing Grandpa’s old overalls, Uncle Paul’s flannel shirt, and the shoes Josh had outgrown last year. Its head was a flour sack, stuffed full of straw from an old tick, and on that head perched The Hat.\
 \
 tick = mattress\
 \
 (paragraph 16) Mom hauled the stuffed body outside and set it up on a post in the middle of the cornfield. And that’s where it stayed.\
 \
 (paragraph 17) Our corn crop that year was particularly good. For some reason the birds steered clear of our fields and raided the neighbors’ instead. Maybe it had something to do with our scarecrow, I don’t know. All I do know is that from then on, we rarely saw crows on our property except during the month of June.\
 \
 (paragraph 16) That’s when Great-aunt Marjorie comes to visit.\

 Excerpt from Gregor and the Sheep\
 by Toby Rosenstrauch\
 \
 (paragraph 1) In a valley in the highlands of Scotland, there once lived a young tenant farmer, Gregor, and his widowed mother. Although they worked hard, they could never accumulate enough money to buy the flock of sheep they longed to have, for their small parcel of land produced only modest amounts of oats and barley. To make matters\
 worse, MacTavish, the owner of this and many other crofts, always found reasons not to pay the farmers all they had earned. . . .\
 \
 crofts = small farms\
 \
 (paragraph 2) When he opened the door each morning and looked out, he saw MacTavish’s house on top of a mountain, a magnificent stone mansion surrounded by red, pink, and violet rhododendrons. Gregor often climbed the slope and stood outside the iron gates, wondering what fine furnishings and delicious foods lay within. Neighbors claimed\
 that MacTavish owned many houses and even kept a chest of gems under his bed. As Gregor, his mother, and their neighbors grew gaunt and pale with hard work and not enough food, they railed against MacTavish, who had swindled all of them at one time or another.\
 \
 swindled = cheated or tricked\
 \
 (paragraph 3) One day, as Gregor listened to the bagpipe music that drifted from the open windows of MacTavish’s mansion, he had an idea. That night, when his mother was asleep, he emptied the jug that held their money and counted it. After putting back a few coins for food, he put the rest in his pocket. The next morning, he hurried to the market, where he went from farmer to farmer, asking the prices of sheep for sale.\
 Gregor found many handsome animals, but they were all too expensive. When he reached a stall with scrawny and sickly sheep, the owner beckoned to him. . . .\
 \
 (paragraph 4) Gregor shook his head and began to walk away. The man grabbed his sleeve and whispered in his ear, “This one will make her owner rich!” Gregor examined the old sheep with spindly legs and dirty, unkempt wool—the worst of the lot. “If she will make me rich,” said Gregor, “how is it that she has not done so for you?”\
 \
 (paragraph 5) The man paused, thinking. “I have not had her long enough!”\
 \
 (paragraph 6) “Nonsense,” said Gregor, but he gave the man his money and led the pitiful animal home.\
 \
 (paragraph 7) When his mother saw what he had bought with their money, she burst into tears. “My foolish son, what have you done? Now we will starve, and no one will help us!”\
 \
 (paragraph 8) “Do as I say, Mother, and we will be rich. I promise.”\
 \
 (paragraph 9) She wanted to believe him. Wiping her eyes with her ragged sleeve, she asked what he wanted her to do.\
 \
 (paragraph 10) “Go to market and tell everyone that your son has a sheep that will make whoever owns her rich,” said Gregor. . . .\
 \
 (paragraph 11) One morning, a carriage arrived. Two servants opened the door and a stout, welldressed gentleman emerged. His Tartan kilt was made of the finest wool, his ascot was pure silk, and his shoes had silver buckles. On his fat fingers were eight gold rings, and his pomaded hair glistened in the sun. It was MacTavish!\
 \
 Tartan kilt = traditional clothing worn by Scottish Highlanders\
 \
 ascot = a type of necktie\
 \
 (paragraph 12) Gregor bowed as if to royalty. MacTavish looked at him sternly. “I have come to rid you of the unfortunate sheep that everyone is talking about,” said MacTavish, opening his sporran. “I can pay your price and I will have her, even though she has done nothing for you, I see.” MacTavish sneered at Gregor.\
 \
 sporran = a small bag worn at the waist for holding personal items\
 \
 (paragraph 13) Gregor hugged Dear One. “I will not sell her to you!”\
 \
 (paragraph 14) ”At that, MacTavish, whose servants were helping him into his carriage, turned and marched back. “I will pay anything,” he said. “Name the price.”\
 \
 (paragraph 15) Gregor was ready. “That,” he said, pointing up to the mansion above them. “I will have the dwelling and everything in it—furniture, utensils, even the chest of gems under your bed.”\
 \
 (paragraph 16) “Done,” said MacTavish.\
 \
 (paragraph 17) The next day, Gregor and his mother moved into the mansion that had once belonged to MacTavish, and MacTavish brought Dear One to the market so that all might see he could indeed own anything he wanted. Then MacTavish and the sheep rode away in his carriage to another of his houses in a valley beyond the mountains.\
 \
 (paragraph 18) After months had passed and the sheep had done nothing to increase MacTavish’s riches, he realized he had been swindled. Furious beyond speech, he returned to the mansion, but Gregor would not open the gates.\
 \
 (paragraph 19) “I have been cheated!” shouted MacTavish.\
 \
 (paragraph 20) “You have not been cheated,” said Gregor. “I was the owner of the sheep, and she has made me rich, hasn’t she?”\
 \
 (paragraph 21) “Yes, but . . . ,” sputtered MacTavish.\
 \
 (paragraph 22) “Then you got what you paid for.” Gregor turned and walked away.\
 \
 (paragraph 21) Soon afterward, Gregor sold the chest of gems and bought the huge flock of sheep he and his mother had always wanted. He shared the rest of his fortune with the other poor families of the valley who had been cheated by MacTavish.\
Which detail would be most important to include in a summary of the story?\
(A) Gregor goes to the market and talks to many farmers about their sheep.\
 (B) Gregor’s mother is asleep when Gregor takes money to buy the sheep.\
 (C) MacTavish lives at another one of his houses after he buys the sheep from\
 Gregor.\
 (D) MacTavish goes to buy Gregor’s sheep after he hears rumors about the\
 animal.\

Excerpt from One-Eyed Cat\
 by Paula Fox\
 \
 Ned loved snow, the whisper when he walked through it, a sound like candles being\
 blown out, the coming indoors out of it into the warmth, and standing on the register in\
 the big hall through which the dusty, metal-smelling heat blew up, and the going back out\
 again, shivering, cold, stooping and scooping up a handful to make a snowball, packing it\
 (line 5) hard with wet mittens, hefting it, tossing it as far as he could, and the runners of his sled\
 whispering across it as he sleighed down the slopes which were smooth and glittering and\
 hard, like great jewels.\
 On the first of December, there was a heavy snowfall. When Ned looked out of his\
 window the next morning, the river glowed like a snake made out of light as it wound\
 (line 10) among the snow-covered mountains.\
 He ate breakfast hastily, too preoccupied to read the story on the cereal box.\
 Mrs. Scallop (Mrs. Scallop: Ned’s family’s housekeeper) was broody this morning and left him a lone, her glance passing over him as\
 it passed over the kitchen chairs.\
 On the porch, he paused to take deep breaths of air which tasted, he imagined, like\
 (line 15) water from the center of the ocean, then he waded into the snow, passing the Packard (Packard: a brand of car that is no longer manufactured), its\
 windows white and hidden, the crabapple tree with its weighted branches, down the long\
 hill trying to guess if he was anywhere near the buried driveway. By the time he reached\
 Mr. Scully’s house, his galoshes were topped with snow and his feet were wet. Mr. Scully’s\
 shades were drawn; the house had a pinched look as though it felt the cold.\
 (line 20) Ned went around to the back until he could see the shed. There were boot tracks in\
 the snow leading to it and returning to the back door. He guessed the old man had taken\
 in the cat’s bowl; it was nowhere to be seen. You couldn’t leave anything out in this\
 weather, it would freeze. Mr. Scully had told him that finding water in the winter was a\
 big problem for animals. Licking the snow or ice could make them sick.\
 (line 25) Ned stared hard at the shed. Perhaps the cat was inside, squeezed in behind logs in a\
 tight space where its own breath would keep it warm. He was going to be late to school if\
 he didn’t get a move on, but he kept looking hard all over the yard as though he could\
 make the cat appear out of snow and gray sky. Twice, his glance passed over the icebox.\
 The third time, he saw that the motionless mound on top of it was not only the quilt but\
 (line 30) the cat, joined into one shape by a dusting of snow.\
 Ned held his breath for a moment, then put his own feet in Mr. Scully’s tracks and\
 went toward the shed. The tracks had frozen and they crunched under Ned’s weight, but\
 the cat didn’t raise its head. Ned halted a few feet away from it—but of course, he realized,\
 it wouldn’t hear him because of its deaf ear. He could have gone closer to it than he’d ever\
 (line 35) been but he had a sudden vision of the cat exploding into fear when it finally did\
 hear him.\
 When he got back to the front of the house, he saw fresh footsteps on the road. He\
 could tell it was the road because of the deep ditches which fell away to either side. He\
 guessed they were Billy’s tracks. It was odd to think that Billy, huffing and puffing, had\
 (line 40) gone past Mr. Scully’s place, thinking his own thoughts, while he, Ned, only a few yards\
 away, had been searching for the cat. He found Evelyn’s tracks, too, and later on, Janet’s,\
 the smallest of all. He felt ghostly as if he’d been left alone on a white, silent globe.\
 Somewhere in the evergreen woods, snow must have slid off a bough, for he heard the\
 loud plop, then the fainter sound of the bough springing up, relieved of the weight. He\
 (line 45) thought about the cat, visualizing how it had looked on the quilt. How still it had been!\
 Why hadn’t he gone right up to it, looked at it close, touched its fur? Why had it been so\
 motionless—still as death, still as a dead vole he’d seen last summer in the grass near the\
 well? He came to the snow-covered blacktop road upon which a few cars had left their\
 ridged tire tracks. He had a strong impulse to turn back, to play hooky for the first time in\
 (line 50) his life. Mr. Scully, with his poor eyesight, might not spot the cat on top of the icebox,\
 might not, then, set food out for it. Fretting and shivering, his feet numb, Ned went on\
 to school.\
 He tried very hard to concentrate on his lessons, to watch Miss Jefferson’s plump, even\
 handwriting on the blackboard as she wrote out the lines from a poem by Thomas Gray\
 (line 55) that the class was to memorize that week, but try as he might, the image of the unmoving\
 animal on the ragged old quilt persisted. Last week, on a rainy afternoon, the cat had\
 looked at Ned, had cocked its head as though to see him better. Its one eye, narrowed, had\
 reminded him of a grain of wheat.\
 “The curfew tolls the knell of parting day,\
 (line 60) The lowing herd wind slowly o’er the lea . . .”\
 Ned read the lines several times before copying them down in his copybook. The\
 words made no sense to him. It was this that had made his hours in school so hard ever\
 since he and Mr. Scully had seen the cat last autumn, this drawing away of his attention\
 from everything that was going on around him. He was either relieved because the cat was\
 (line 65) where he could see it or fearful because he didn’t know where it was.\
Read these words from lines 18 and 19.\
 Mr. Scully’s shades were drawn; the house had a pinched look as though it felt the cold.\
 The use of the words “pinched look” contributes to the tone of the story by making the house seem\
(A) tense\
 (B) angry\
 (C) uncertain\
 (D) disappointed\

Base your answers to questions 3 and 4 on the letter below and on your knowledge of social studies.\
 \
 . . . I have heard that you are a kind, compassionate monarch. I am sure that you will not do to others what you yourself do not desire. I have also heard that you have instructed every British ship that sails for Canton not to bring any prohibited goods to China. It seems that your policy is as enlightened as it is proper. The fact that British ships have continued to bring opium to China results perhaps from the impossibility of making a thorough inspection of all of them owing to their large numbers. I am sending you this letter to reiterate [repeat] the seriousness with which we enforce the law of the Celestial Empire and to make sure that merchants from your honorable country will not attempt to violate it again. . . .\
 Source: Lin Tse-Hsü, A Letter to Queen Victoria, 1839\
The primary purpose of this letter was to persuade the British to\
(1) stop the flow of opium into China\
 (2) increase trade with China\
 (3) end all business with China\
 (4) defend China against invasion\
